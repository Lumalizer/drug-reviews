0,Cymbalta,Diabetic Peripheral Neuropathy,6.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"March 5, 2022",1,"My issues are Severe anxiety, severe depression, neuropathy.  I had suicidal thoughts with Lexapro so I decided to try Cymbalta. Gave me jaw pain, weird taste and smell when starting it but not bad effects. It helped my crying spells to stop and seemed to slightly increase depression. I was on 30 mg. However it made my panic disorder and anxiety skyrocket. It really helped neuropathy and phantom pains I’ve been having. But the heightened anxiety I couldn’t stand so I had to go off of it. It gave me a weird hypersensitivity feeling.",Mdog101

3,Cymbalta,Diabetic Peripheral Neuropathy,1.0,,"May 26, 2020",46,"Took Cymbalta for severe nerve pain.  (Hemangioblastoma removal inside spinal cord @ C4,5,6).  It worked well for the pain and I had little side effects.  Came to a point my doctor and I decided I didn’t need it anymore.  Then the fun began.  I don’t care what kind of issue you have or how much pain you are in - DO NOT TAKE THIS MEDICATION!  Trying to get off this was the worst thing I could ever have imagined and it went on for months!!  The list of symptoms was long and bizarre.  I can’t stress enough how bad it was...please, please don’t take even 1.PS To Loulou:  after being deathly ill for weeks I called my doctor, again, and they told me to just start taking it again and start tapering off again at another time!  What?!?  No frigging way so I suffered through almost six months of horrid withdrawal.  It does go away, I promise!  You aren’t alone - I felt EXACTLY the same way you do now!  Hang in and do not start taking it again!!  Good luck to you!",Julles43

5,Cymbalta,Diabetic Peripheral Neuropathy,8.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"August 30, 2019",19,"I've been taking Cymbalta for 6 months 20 mg once a day it has helped with my neuropathy in my legs but nothing has stopped it so it's better than taking nothing which causes pain that is unbearable. But when taking the 60 mg it has me very nauseated and off balance. So I have not been able to take a larger amount, then 20 mg a day. I tried taking it at night but I was really restless oh, so I take it in the morning with food.",MJ

7,Cymbalta,Diabetic Peripheral Neuropathy,10.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"June 11, 2019",22,"Diagnosed with Idiopathic Small Nerve fiber neuropathy and eventually put on Cymbalta. 60 mg daily.  Been taking it for 5 years. First week was difficult but my Neurologist encouraged me to soldier through. Relief began after about the 5th day. My main complaint is fatigue. On the upside, I sleep like a teenager. I’m retired so I can sleep in. I don’t think I would be able to work on this though.  Recently, I discovered I can get by with 60 mg every other day. That’s what brought me here. Looking for info about that. I have an appointment with my Neurologist in July and wanted more info before I discuss my condition",Frosty
8,Cymbalta,Diabetic Peripheral Neuropathy,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"June 6, 2019",19,"Joined this website solely to warn others that the side effects  of Cymbalta were worse than any other med ever. After taking for 10 days nearly all the side effects that others mention were experienced, after stopping the scariest pains were felt down the middle of left arm and less down the right, groin pain radiating down the left leg and less down the right and the feeling someone was pushing their thumb into my neck on my jugular.",FuzzyDunlop
9,Cymbalta,Diabetic Peripheral Neuropathy,3.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"March 25, 2018",20,"I’ve been taking 30 mg a day for a few months, prescribed partly for depression but mainly for neuropathy. I’ve noticed a marked reduction in pain, a minimal positive effect on depression but the skyrocketing anxiety is crazy. It seemed to actually decrease anxiety for about a week, then went in the opposite direction. I asked my doctor about this, and discontinuing it, but he said not to, and instead go to 60 mg. This has put me in an awkward position of noncompliance (for good cause IMO). Ultimately though, I guess it’s my responsibility. If I don’t notice a decrease in the anxiety soon I’ll be stopping Cymbalta.  No sense in paying a doctor to feel worse!",Anonymous
10,Cymbalta,Diabetic Peripheral Neuropathy,,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"October 15, 2017",28,"Was prescribed 20mg of this when my hands started burning, which caused me more anxiety than the idiopathic nerve damage in my feet that was detected on an EMG. Feeling much less anxious, NO nerve pain in my hands, and 80-90% less tingling/vibrating in my feet. The first week on this I had severe headaches in the morning, which I pushed thru and didn't have after about 10 days. I feel noticeably less energetic and groggy in the morning than I used to. Other than that, I haven't noticed any side effects, and I usually react to medications (which makes me cautious). I am not on ANY other meds. I would rate this a 10, but the awful headaches in the morning were a pain and feeling groggy until noon-ish is tolerable but not ideal.",Justme22
11,Cymbalta,Diabetic Peripheral Neuropathy,,,"October 4, 2017",38,"I have taken Cymbalta for 12 years for Peripheral Neuropathy. The prior 15 years I had what felt like a million little electric eels burrowing just under the skin of my right thigh. Or it felt like my thigh was packed in ice. For 15 years I was blown off by every doctor I saw under my insurance.A Dr not covered by my insurance prescribed Cymbalta.  I had an immediate improvement, which just kept getting better. 0 side effects. A year in and things unrelated to the neuropathy improved dramatically. A hand tremor went away, I no longer fell a lot. Eventually Kaiser would cover the Generic, which makes me throw up.",hmmmmmmmmm
12,Cymbalta,Diabetic Peripheral Neuropathy,8.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"September 8, 2017",37,I'm a recovering alcoholic of 16 years. I was diagnosed diabetic in 2008 and continued drinking until May 7th 2017. Unfortunately my addiction had caused a lot of damage to my body that I didn't notice while consuming 3-6 gallons of beer a day. In the past if I didn't have a drink I would start to feel pain in my legs so I drank more. Now  after the first I weeks and the shakes went away I went to a doctor to get my health checked. After fully disclosing my situation he prescribed gabapentin.. I had a bad skin burring reaction after a few weeks and my legs and feet were like lighting storms of pain. He then prescribed Cymbalta. I was reluctant at first reading all the side effects. But now I take it 2 hours before bed and the pain is gone.,Amoya81

Before this medication, the searing pain in my legs was unbearable. I could not walk because of it. I was originally put on gabapenton, and had such severe side effects that I quit taking it. My neurologist then prescribed me Cymbalta. He started me on a low dose, then after a month doubled it. Since then, I experience little to no pain. When I am a bit uncomfortable, I get in a warm bath and the pain is gone. I sleep better, have better control over my blood sugar as it does suppress appetite, but that means I am not munching or over eating. I can not live without it!!!",Anonymous

When I took the Cymbalta during the day it made me incredibly sleepy  to the point I could NOT stay awake so I discontinued it's use. Fast forward a few years and I started experiencing HORRIBLE Diabetic Peripheral Neuropathy. Doctor put me on Cymbalta to try and treat the pain.  This time I took it before bed.  I didn't notice any sleepiness during the day,  and my nerve pain got better, and eventually was completely gone.

31,Cymbalta,Diabetic Peripheral Neuropathy,3.0,,"August 6, 2010",29,"I was very unsteady on my feet, at first some of the pain was resolved, but it didn't work. Even though my feet were NOT swollen they felt that way, very tight feeling. It felt like I was walking on balloons, terrible feeling and I was afraid to walk with that unsteadiness. Didn't work for me, since then, I have been on many different medications. Neurontin, didn't help, amitriptiline, didn't help, Lyrica, didn't help. I am on nortriptyline now with a pain patch. The fentanyl patch really helps, but I don't want to stay on this forever, so trying different medications. I am only supposed to leave the pain patch on 3 days, and found with the new medication, nortriptyline, I can go 5 days. So I am hopeful here. ",kathygirl

The pain almost disappeared!  Approximately 6-8 weeks later, I noticed that the neuropathy pain started back up again despite continuing on the medicines.  I too, had insomnia making it difficult, at best, to be alert, focused or have any energy the following day.  To this day, I still have some insomnia and an increase in the neuropathy symptoms; BUT Cymbalta 60mg & Neurontin 600mg are the BEST drugs so far in lessening the pain.",Jo.Nigle
