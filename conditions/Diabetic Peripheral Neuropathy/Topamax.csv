0,Topamax,Diabetic Peripheral Neuropathy,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"August 24, 2021",0,"My real issue is chronic post-breast surgery and cancer treatment chronic nerve pain (which is not on the list): Second day.  OMG, I thought gabapentin and nortriptyline side effects were bad!  I have a job and I have to talk to people.  I could never take this drug and work.  And I wouldn't want to quit working to take it.  Doctors think this is helpful.  Welcome to being a lab rat, I was still in pain, my eye and the surrounding area hurt, continuously drinking water, couldn't concentrate, felt like what it must be like on amphetamines,  that lasted ~9 hours and then I CRASHED and shortly after had a total meltdown.  I do not need to ever feel that way again as I try to help myself.",Anonymous
1,Topamax,Diabetic Peripheral Neuropathy,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"October 7, 2020",24,"Day one Topamax helped my neuropathy. I’ve have tried everything. When I say everything, I mean everything. Opioids, lyrica, gabapentin, cymbalta, injections in my spine, and I’ve even considered surgery. One 25 mg dose and I felt better than I have in 20 years. I hadn’t been able to lay on my left side comfortably for over 5 years. The first night, I slept 4 hours straight on my left side. Not only does it help the pain, it keeps the muscle tension down from the nerve aggravation.I will say I got some pretty crazy side effects the first couple days like drooling, sleep paralysis, very realistic dreams, muscle pains in my arm pit area, and upper respiratory symptoms but those all went away within 4-5 days. I am extremely happy with this medication.",Painedinohio

4,Topamax,Diabetic Peripheral Neuropathy,8.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"August 5, 2017",33,"I've been taking 25mg/day for 3 weeks for Nerve damage/back pain .  I love this medication! It has some interesting side effects...(I have tried Gabapentin, Lyrica, Tramadol, and Percocet - but had really bad experiences on all of them.)   The tingling goes away after a week.  hot flashes - too young for this! Mentally in a better place-I was in a depressive funk before taking it.  Cleared my head a bit - I actually want to get better now and am walking/making an effort b/c I'm able to b/c my pain is manageable.  I still get random shooting pains, but not as harsh.  Major con is my hair is falling out!!!  any suggestions on hair-loss?Otc supplements I take with it: AZO Cranberry Urinary Tract Health, b12, biotin, pnv, and fish oil.  drink lots of water!!!",MB29
5,Topamax,Diabetic Peripheral Neuropathy,10.0,,"August 14, 2010",102,"I was diagnosed with trauma induced neuropathy in my left heel following an injury that became infected, developed cellulitis and an ulcer. It took 2 months of intensive treatment for my foot to heal but about 3 weeks after I returned to work, I started experiencing sharp, electrical type pain in my heel. It was excruciating. My doctor prescribed Neurontin at first but I was not able to tolerate it. I was switched to Topamax and within a day, I had full relief and since then, I have been pain free. Yes, I am a juvenile diabetic but I had never had problems with my feet until this happened. The neuropathy is confined to my left heel only. Topamax is the best. The side effects are minimal but even if they weren't, it's worth it to be pain free.",Anonymous
6,Topamax,Diabetic Peripheral Neuropathy,9.0,,"November 11, 2009",96,"Topamax has helped my diabetic nerve damage more than any other drug that my doctor has prescribed for me, and it does not have all the other nasty side effects, including the weight gain.  I get enough of that from the insulin.  I love taking the Topamax.  I'm on a low dose (25 mg) but it sure has helped me.",gkbiddle
7,Topamax,Diabetic Peripheral Neuropathy,9.0,,"August 1, 2009",137,"After having developed neuropathy post surgery I was suffering daily. I had tried Neurontin with little relief and was prescribed Topamax initially at 25mg. Over the last 6 years I've been titrated up to 300 mg and can tell you that this drug has helped tremendously. Initially I had common side effects, difficulty finding words, I lost weight about 20 pounds, and found that I had some tingling in my hands and feet. These issues generally resolved in time or I have just grown accustomed to them. For anyone who initially has issues with the side effects try and stick with the medicine for a little bit unless totally intolerable, it gets better.",Anonymous
