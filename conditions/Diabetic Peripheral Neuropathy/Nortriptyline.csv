0,Nortriptyline,Diabetic Peripheral Neuropathy,9.0,,"March 15, 2022",0,"Have tried almost everything else, and they either did not relieve pain, or the side-effects were terrible.  Amitriptyline once worked and then didn't.Nortriptyline (20mg) keeps the life-degrading pain away (idiopathic neuropathy).  Sure its still there (never too far away), but at least I can sleep at night.  And with the low dose there is room for upwards movement if needs be.  Only side effect is malaise.  But then compared to other side effects .... this is OK.",PatientX
1,Nortriptyline,Diabetic Peripheral Neuropathy,10.0,Taken for 10 years or more,"August 5, 2020",11,"I used this drug nortriptyline for 20 years with great results via VA Medical Doctors.  Due to a foul up it was transferred to Mental health clinic, due to Covid-19, the VA missed prescribing it. I fought for 4 months to get it, which included 3 months of misery.  When they did get it to me they had reduced the dosage from 6 daily to 2 daily.  More misery.  Hopefully, they will take my advice and up the dosage!",Big Grit

3,Nortriptyline,Diabetic Peripheral Neuropathy,8.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"January 8, 2014",36,"My personal experience was that this medicine, it worked very well for my nerve pain. I did not have full motion of my neck on my right side and had severe pain in my arm and shoulder area.  Medicine took a few weeks to build up in my system but I no longer have any pain and now have full motion in my neck.  Downside is that I am a little groggy when I wake up.  This medicine has allowed me to return back to work without pain.",Bigkid51
4,Nortriptyline,Diabetic Peripheral Neuropathy,1.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"November 9, 2013",17,"Severe side effects - extreme dry mouth, extreme dizziness, extreme weakness. No real help for the neuropathy. Could not figure out why I was feeling so poorly, until I did some research online, and discovered nortriptyline has a negative interaction with FOUR of the other medications I take. Stopped taking nortriptyline, and felt so much better almost instantly.",sas300zx
