I became bedridden for three months while on this dose. After a year, she finally looked at the lab reports from the emergency room of my first day, raised the medication a bit and called it diabetic nephropathy. I notice the maximum allowable dose of 3600 mg on here information sheet and built up to that dosage. Finally, some minor relief! My new doctor asked how much I was  taking and he replied, ""We'll keep you on that dose if it's working."" We've discussed a larger doses beyond this maximum dose, but I'm good so long as everything is improving with no side effects.If your doctor is keeping  you on a low dose, get a new doctor. It take a huge dose to even begin to see progress. Build up the dosage slowly and you have a good chance of avoiding the nasty side effects that others have told me about.",Happy

Prior to using gabapentin, my pain was intolerable, and was interfering with my ability to hold a job. I've experimented with upping my dosage to as much as 1500 mg, and found that at that dosage it almost completely eliminated the pain, down to the point where it felt like a mild sun burn over my body, rather than like scalding water burns. However, I found that I did not like the side effects it was causing.I find that taking 900 mg seems to be optimal for me, with the best pain reduction and the least amount of side effects per dose.
