0,Vitamin D3,Vitamin D Deficiency,1.0,Taken for 5 to 10 years,"November 3, 2021",16,"I started taking Vitamin D3 years ago due to deficiency. I have taken 2,000iu and 1,000iu's. For years I have suffered debilitating leg and feet cramps at night and horrible restless legs. I have always blamed it on my blood pressure meds, but have finally figured out that any time I stop taking the d3 I have no more leg cramps. Now I will add 2 drops (about 200ii) into water once in a while, but even that mess me feel sick, so no more!! The leg cramps would even go into my thighs and I would not be able to stand up it was so painful. But of course the Dr said it couldn't be that. Then why does it stop when I stop taking the D3!!?? I wish Dr.s would do more research before just throwing prescriptions at us......",Faith
1,Vitamin D3,Vitamin D Deficiency,10.0,Taken for 10 years or more,"October 22, 2021",4,"I have been taking about 8,000 IUs daily for several years. I have ME/CFS and am for the most part house confined so I had serious Vit D deficiency. I had cervical surgery several years ago. Aside from herniated discs I had severe bone souring and osteophitosis  (osteopath arthritis). I also take high doses of calcium for bone health. I have had no side affects from the Vitamin D3. I am now in the mid to high middle recommended range when tested.",Guitar man
2,Vitamin D3,Vitamin D Deficiency,10.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"July 17, 2021",16,"I was deficient in D3, and was prescribed 5000 iu per day. Six months later, my Vitamin D level is in the normal range, with no side effects. Possibly pure coincidence, but my Cholesterol level has dropped below 200 for the first time in 30 years, with no change in diet, medication, or exercise! The only difference was the D3. Iâ€™m a fan.",Olderandwiser49
3,Vitamin D3,Vitamin D Deficiency,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"April 20, 2021",16,I was sent to a rheumatologist for arthritis pain. He suggested 50k iu vit D3 for 7 days & 50k iu once a week for the next 7 weeks until my next appt. I have hyperparathyroidism which means I produce calcium oxalate kidney stones. I declined his suggestion on the grounds that that much vitamin D3 would increase my blood calcium level dramatically & therefore my stones also. He knew I had stones but said I needed the vit because it was the calcium producing the bone spurs that was causing my arthritic pain. What?? So I want to take more calcium?? Have to find another doctor!,Redrich
4,Vitamin D3,Vitamin D Deficiency,1.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"January 22, 2021",83,"I struggle badly with vitamin D supplements. Don't ever let a doctor tell you it's not the supplement! The only thing I do like about it is for me it's almost like a sleeping pill. I pass out very quickly after taking it every time. However, the next day I always feel tense, dizzy, short of breath, headaches, muscle aches, anxiety, stomach pains, constipation, and have acid reflux issues. This ALWAYS goes away when I stop the supplement. I've tried adding magnesium and it doesn't help.",Vern

7,Vitamin D3,Vitamin D Deficiency,1.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"January 17, 2020",27,"I had bloodwork done, and was found to have very low vitamin D levels, 55nmol/L. My nurse practitioner advised me to take 2,000 IU daily.  I was already taking 4,000 IU daily, so I upped the dosage to 10,000 IU. I got my results from my latest blood tests, and I am still deficient in vitamin D, 56nmol/L, a whole 7 months later!  Clearly, something else must be wrong here.  I am a diabetic, and I am also taking Metformin, Lantus and Humalog insulins, as well as a small dose of Metoprolol.",D-ficient
8,Vitamin D3,Vitamin D Deficiency,3.0,,"September 7, 2019",72,"So my doc prescribed me 10000 ui for 6 weeks, since I was vitamin d deficient. After 2 weeks taking these, I noticed terrible heart palpitations, fast heart beat, I went to ER with heart rate 172, the scariest day of my life. And vitamin d make me so drowsy and dizzy. I'm definitely not taking this anymore. Helped me with my levels, now is 36, but its making me feel miserable.",LeenaLee
9,Vitamin D3,Vitamin D Deficiency,,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"August 10, 2017",22,"D3 was prescribed as over the counter at 2k per day. I feel it would be more effective at 5k per day or more. Will check with next blood test. Did not notice a difference. Exhaustion is a real issue with me, partly due to the need for opioids; chronic pain from a surgical accident.",phillymark
10,Vitamin D3,Vitamin D Deficiency,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"March 12, 2017",127,"I was told by my doctor that I am Vitamin D deficient and should take 5000 iu of vitamin D per day. I began taking the supplement and within 36 hours began having HORRIBLE leg pains and muscle aches.The pain in my legs was so bad I could barely walk. I was also extremely nauseated, so much so that I couldn't eat. I stopped the vitamin D and in no time the muscle pains and nausea was gone. I now take 1000 iu of vitamin d per day with no side effects. I know it's less than my doctor wants me to take but that's too bad. Why do doctors insist on such enormous amount of vitamin D without considering the side effects??? I would rather be vitamin d deficient than suffer the side effects of a ""theraputic"" dose of vitamin d.",FrustratedOldLady
11,Vitamin D3,Vitamin D Deficiency,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"January 31, 2017",84,"I have been struggling with arthritis-like pain for months. Swollen joints, pain, hard to move around, and muscle weakness. Started taking vitamin D3 and the difference was night and day. Strength is restored, pain is decreasing... I am on the mend. I used to work outside but now in an office all the time, I guess it played a bigger role in my health than I realized.",Plasmodesmata
12,Vitamin D3,Vitamin D Deficiency,1.0,,"October 19, 2016",162,"After my wellness checkup and blood analysis, I was told by my md to start taking Vit. D3-2000 daily.I took it as recommended for 2 days and I noticed that I was experiencing dizziness, tiredness and really bad cramps in my hands, feet and legs.  I thought that I was dehydrated and drank more water.  The cramps kept getting worse and I also started having increased palpitations and more dizziness.  As the only change I had made in my daily regimen was taking the D3, I decided to stop taking it to see if it might be the cause.  Sure enough, these symptoms disappeared.  So, why are we being told to take this?  Several of my friends and family have been advised to do the same lately.  Is it a new ""health"" sham?",Magnolia Joy
