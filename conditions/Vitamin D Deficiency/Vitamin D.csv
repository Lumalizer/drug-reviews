It started at approx. 11:30 and got normal by 23:00. I was alone I had no clue what to do, kept drinking little water on small intervals. Complete no for this one or calcirol for vitamin D. Now I can't imagine to take any drug for D.",narwal

I have taken 2,000iu and 1,000iu's. For years I have suffered debilitating leg and feet cramps at night and horrible restless legs. I have always blamed it on my blood pressure meds, but have finally figured out that any time I stop taking the d3 I have no more leg cramps. Now I will add 2 drops (about 200ii) into water once in a while, but even that mess me feel sick, so no more!! The leg cramps would even go into my thighs and I would not be able to stand up it was so painful. But of course the Dr said it couldn't be that. Then why does it stop when I stop taking the D3!!?? I wish Dr.s would do more research before just throwing prescriptions at us......",Faith

Realised within a week my heart was pounding and decided to check my blood pressure. Was shocked to see it was at 165/90. Usual is 120-80 to 130/80. I exercise daily, eat sensibly and not overweight. Am stopping Vitamin D immediately as have read that some people react badly to it. We’re all different so why do doctors insist that supplements cannot cause these types of issues? I have also reacted badly to K2 in the past and no longer take it.",Anon
5,Vitamin D,Vitamin D Deficiency,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"August 29, 2021",7,"D 1000 IU (cholecalciferol):I had low vitamin D. My doctor put me on 50,000 iu/week.

I have to avoid light, sounds, movement. I make myself eat cause nausea and weight loss. Doctors dismiss it but I have read about serotonin and other levels being too high. I regret taking this and currently waiting for my body to be deficient again, just so I can feel ok. First 15 hours bad. Doctor said 2-3 days but its been my 6th day. Read after 15 days vit d is down to 50%. 25% by 30days.     I avoid light, any Vid D foods, anything to cause serotonin levels to go up, I was better off in my level mental state.

6,Vitamin D,Vitamin D Deficiency,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"August 22, 2021",9,"I was advised to take 2,000 IUs of cholecalciferol daily after being diagnosed with a vitamin d deficiency. About 6 hours after my first pill I noticed my heart was racing and I started having palpitations. Then the anxiety set in. At this point, I didn’t make the connection with the cholecalciferol, but after continuing to take it over the following days, the anxiety turned to absolute sweaty panic and dread, as well as insomnia. By day 4 I was horribly depressed, no appetite, and nauseous. I don’t think my doctor believed me when I told her the cholecalciferol was causing this, but I know that’s what it was. I later learned that cholecalciferol creates serotonin in your brain by increasing the enzyme tryptophan hydroxylase 2. If you get too much serotonin, you develop serotonin syndrome - and my experience aligned exactly with the symptoms of serotonin syndrome. Hopefully this is helpful to others. For now, I’ll just keep my vitamin d deficiency.",Eric

Six months later, my Vitamin D level is in the normal range, with no side effects. Possibly pure coincidence, but my Cholesterol level has dropped below 200 for the first time in 30 years, with no change in diet, medication, or exercise! The only difference was the D3.

8,Vitamin D,Vitamin D Deficiency,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"April 20, 2021",16,Vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol):I was sent to a rheumatologist for arthritis pain. He suggested 50k iu vit D3 for 7 days & 50k iu once a week for the next 7 weeks until my next appt. I have hyperparathyroidism which means I produce calcium oxalate kidney stones. I declined his suggestion on the grounds that that much vitamin D3 would increase my blood calcium level dramatically & therefore my stones also. He knew I had stones but said I needed the vit because it was the calcium producing the bone spurs that was causing my arthritic pain. What?? So I want to take more calcium?? Have to find another doctor!,Redrich

I was put on colcalciferol 2x 800unit caps a day.. initially I was fine but day 4 my stomach started to whine and churn  and I was nauseous.  On day 5 I was doubled up in pain, stomach cramps, diarrhoea, banging headache, puffy, bloated! I spoke to the Dr who said it’s not a ‘normal response’ .. she then re checked the ‘possible other side effects’ and there they were .. lots of them. I’ve stopped taking the capsules and 3 days later I’m still poorly, less poorly admittedly but maybe these things should be started gradually.Nasty experience that’s still with me but hopefully it’ll continue to ease in the coming days.

Don't ever let a doctor tell you it's not the supplement! The only thing I do like about it is for me it's almost like a sleeping pill. I pass out very quickly after taking it every time. However, the next day I always feel tense, dizzy, short of breath, headaches, muscle aches, anxiety, stomach pains, constipation, and have acid reflux issues. This ALWAYS goes away when I stop the supplement. I've tried adding magnesium and it doesn't help.",Vern

I suffered from insomnia, night sweats, irritability, mood swings, chills, gastro issues (gas, acid reflux) heart palpitations and fatigue. Labs showed a Vitamin D deficiency. Doc started me on D3 4,000 iu daily (CVS brand of D3 50 mcg 2,000 iu twice per day. I feel much better!  I sleep through the night and I'm not as irritable and moody each day. I feel happier and more energetic with less cravings for sugars and carbohydrates. I still feel heart palpitations, but they've decreased since quitting caffeine and getting serious about reducing stress. Diet changes include eliminating caffeine (including NSAIDS), reducing sugar, and eliminating dairy. I think the hormones in dairy contribute to my hormonal imbalance and my body was desperately trying to compensate (biggest indicator was adult acne disappearing and reduced growth of random facial hairs). Taking D3 for the last 2 months along with dietary changes has greatly improved symptoms.",Jade

My dr said it was impossible vit D caused this, so he told me to keep taking the drug. 2nd week I ended up in the ER but everything was negative and they told me it couldn't be vit D. I took it 4 times, once a week, until I asked my pharmacist about my symptoms and told me to stop immediately.

I had been taking the D2 for several years, and then they wanted me to take Prolia as my bone loss was getting worse. Stopping the D2, and starting the D3 at 5,000 iu a day with 600 mg of calcium has helped quite a bit.  I would suggest anyone try this before taking something like Prolia, or Forteo for bone loss.
