0,Ergocalciferol,Vitamin D Deficiency,10.0,,"October 23, 2021",1,"I had went through a period of extreme depression and anxiety for several months. I figured that maybe there was something else going on and to stop attributing my physical and mood symptoms as purely due to my depression. I also would have these moments at random times where I felt like I could fall asleep which was concerning me, along with neck pain and random bouts of crying. Working out had also become impossible due to muscle weakness. A severe vitamin d deficiency was found in blood work and began supplementation of 50,000 units. On day one I noticed marked improvements in my depression, anxiety, energy, concentration, and physical discomfort. Of note this takes time to build up the proper levels in your system. I noticed after five days my symptoms coming back so you need to go ahead and keep taking it.",Anonymous

I took it 1 time and never took it again. It made me feel terrible! Headache, fatigue, nausea. I just went to bed after I took it that day, so I could sleep off the effects.

4,Ergocalciferol,Vitamin D Deficiency,5.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"November 20, 2020",36,"Vitamin D2 (ergocalciferol):I’ve been feeling tired and weary for months now. I have severe reflux and dysphasia and GERD. Dairy allergy. I had a flare up and ended up cutting ALL dairy (I still ate a small amount at times) but since then I figured the fatigue must be a vitamin deficiency. And I was right my vitamin  D level was 15. I started my 50,000 once a week vitamin D2 yesterday at 3pm. No symptoms then but couldn’t fall asleep until after 1:00am. It is now the 2nd day and I started having a lot of diarrhea around 10:00 am. And getting tired again. Praying no other side effects. I hope everyone hangs in there I know it’s frustrating. My husband doesn’t understand just how awful I feel Being vitamin defi. and no ones does until they go through it. I know you guys don’t feel the best but hang in there and if you have any strange side effects reach out to your dr to make sure you get good advise. To those feeling better- so happy for you guys !!!",Jen

6,Ergocalciferol,Vitamin D Deficiency,10.0,,"April 25, 2020",93,"I recently started taking the 50,000 IU Vitamin D prescribed by my doctor for Vitamin D deficiency last week. I was very fatigued, muscle cramps, pain, and just felt really bad for awhile now and finally went to the doctor about it and he ran a bunch of blood work, well comes out that my Vitamin D level was 12 which is very low. I have also suffered from depression and anxiety for years now, but more recently the past year it's been worse then usual. Since I've taken 2 doses so far 1 per week I have noticed a marked improvement of all my symptoms! My energy level is a little better, my anxiety and depression have lifted quite a bit and my muscles pain and cramping is improving! I am shocked how much being low on Vitamin D really affects you. I'm hoping the feeling better continues! I am suppose to take 1 per week for 12 weeks and recheck. Anyway, so far so good! Oh and I have not had any side effects at all that I've noticed.",DH
7,Ergocalciferol,Vitamin D Deficiency,2.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"February 15, 2020",41,"Vitamin D2 (ergocalciferol):I took Vitamin D2 50,000iu and it caused me to have heart palpitations.  It also caused anxiety but was probably because the palpitations were quite concerning.  I didn't realize it was the D that was causing them until I forgot to take it one week.  I took it for a few months before I realised it.  Stopped taking it and no more palps.  Tried taking Vitamin D3 2000iu daily and within 3 days of taking it I had the palpitations again.  I then tried 400iu a day for about 3 weeks and no palpitations.  I am now trying 600iu and having palpitations again.  It is definitely the Vitamin D because when I stop taking it all together the palpitations stop completely.  I am deficient with a level at 18.  Been trying to take these for a few years without success.  Maybe building up a tolerance with a low dose will work.  I hope.",Kay
8,Ergocalciferol,Vitamin D Deficiency,,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"October 17, 2019",24,"I was prescribed 50,000 once weekly for 12 weeks for a severe D deficiency.  I had been having headaches but about 2 weeks into it, I started having SEVERE brain shakes/tremors that were constant.  Since I had been having some neuro trouble already it did not occur to me that the Ergocalciferol would be the cause.  It was not until I created a time line (11 weeks in) that I realized the D3 might me the culprit.  I  stopped taking it and within 7-8 days was free from these tremors.  I was then put on 5000 units a day and after about three days the brain shakes/tremors started again.  I stopped taking the d3 and the tremors stopped again.  Now I am left with trying to get my D up without D2 or D3 supplements.  arg!",Katie Baby
9,Ergocalciferol,Vitamin D Deficiency,,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"May 16, 2019",28,"My doctor prescribed 50,000 i.u. once a week.  The first, second, and third week, the headaches were bearable.  Today, I thought I would need to call emergency.  I never had experienced a headache like the one I suffered 6 hours ago.   I am grateful for the changes this medicine has made in my life.  My doctor may simply need to adjust the dosage.  I only wish that I had been informed of the possible side effects. I am a 75 year old female.",Ramona
10,Ergocalciferol,Vitamin D Deficiency,10.0,,"May 2, 2018",41,"I'm heartened to read many positive experiences. For those who have had extremely poor reactions, I hope you find a remedy.I've been ill for so long, it's become normal. I got used to being (literally) sick and tired; sinus headaches more often than not since November 2017. I've been focused on this, blind to everything else. A quick checkup; at which I mentioned always being fatigued, non-restorative sleep, and that the symptoms of fibro resonate with me. I'm not a hypochondriac. I couldn't stand the idea of feeling this way. I was happy when this enormous dose of Vitamin D was prescribed. I have yet to speak with my PCP. This supplement has made me feel less tired, more hopeful, less foggy/spacey.  I'm quite pale; the sun runs rampant on my skin. Yes, I do go outside. Much less often than the average bear, I guess. I'm also extremely photosensitive. I hope this works, and am anxious to see the results of the recent blood test.",RadioSilence
11,Ergocalciferol,Vitamin D Deficiency,8.0,,"February 14, 2018",38,"At age 26, healthy and fit, I suffered through a hemi migraine that resulted in the appearance of a stroke. Some symptoms lasted years. I did not have a stroke, just a major migraine that caused all the textbook symptoms. Fast forward, age 32, had another hemi migraine. After many tests and blood work, I only had 4 abnormals: Copper, Vitamin D, beginning of harden veins in cebral, and an ANA positive. How can a healthy person who always had low BP, cholesterol, and none of the underlying factors get hardening of arteries?! The neurologist set me up with D2, 50,000/wk and D3,10,000/d. No adverse side effects, I don't have as much, foggy brain, depleted energy, nor the severe sensitivity to fluorescent lights. I always believed if I ate the right foods, taking supplements were not necessary. It wasn't 24hrs after taking it, that I've seen a difference, more like a gradual incline. I respect my neurologist addressing the reason for these migraines not giving me something to mask it.",BlessingsD2

I took one pill and was highly allergic to it, I almost died because the doctors didn't know how to treat me. My body temperature was through the roof, hives, swollen muscles, lungs failed, all from one pill. I saw three different doctors. First doctor gave me a shot. The steroid shot did nothing for me, too low of dosage. Second doctor prescribed prednisone but didn't put me on it long enough. I was having allergic reaction for a whole month. After two weeks, I finally saw a specialist who was able to treat it but the heavy medication I was on caused me to have liver damage and other problems.",HatesMedicine

Took this medication for 13 weeks now, have not noticed any side effects or benefits.

At first I was worried about 50,000iu pill for being too strong, but please trust me, the first 24hrs of the very first pill was the best day of my life in 4 years; it was a good decision to take this pill and I recommend everyone to go for it. I am not an expert, but definitely there is a very good reason why our doctors prescribing D2 instead of over the counter D3 supplements, and I am enjoying it and thanking my doctor in my prayer every night.",Jonathan M

20,Ergocalciferol,Vitamin D Deficiency,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"October 17, 2015",39,"After a routine blood test for a physical it was discovered that I had a vitamin D deficiency. My Dr recommended ergocalciferol 50,000 IU capsules once a week for 12 weeks. Around 6 hours after I took that first dose I woke up confused and weak, it was the worse  day of my life. My personality changed completely, I thought I was going crazy. I cried, I was screaming, I couldn't even stand up from my bed. At some point I passed out for a short period and  when I finally opened my eyes everything was spinning. My husband rushed me to the hospital, and after a few tests and a CT scan it was determined that I had a really bad adverse reaction to the vitamin D. They gave me fluids and I guess that's what helped me to recover.",tha1ra
21,Ergocalciferol,Vitamin D Deficiency,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"April 28, 2015",29,"Was prescribed 50000 iu of Drisdol once a week for 12 weeks. I was reluctant to take it since OTC Vitamin D3 triggers migraines. My doctor  assured me that, since Drisdol was Vitamin D2 NOT D3  it wouldn't cause headaches. Boy was he WRONG. With 24 hours after taking the first capsule I had a severe migraine that none of my usual meds even made a dent it.  I ended suffering up in bed for three days. Oh, did I mention the horrible knee pain that came along with the migraine?? I guess I was lucky that I had to stay in bed since my legs hurt too bad to walk. Needless to say,I  stopped the Drisdol. I'm sure my doctor won't be happy with my decision but if he had the reaction to Drisdol that I had I'm sure he would stop taking it too.",grumpymama59
