0,Keytruda,Hodgkin's Lymphoma,10,,"December 23, 2019",8,"Recurrent Hodgkin lymphoma and Keytruda put me in remission immediately, first infusion.  It is a miracle drug for many!  However, side effects after 7 months of treatment were becoming unbearable and ceased.  Skin and lung issues from first month.  Been 3 months since stopping infusions and seem to be improving!",Mike
