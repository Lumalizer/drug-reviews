2,Cipro,Bronchitis,5,,"February 8, 2014",23,I have been taking Cipro for three days now. I'm a father of two girls. I have had to call off work for the past 2 days due to the tiredness and fatigue. The only good thing I can say is that my infection is getting better slowly. This is a very strong medicine for many uses. ,nicolie

6,Cipro,Bronchitis,1,,"January 26, 2010",36,"Dangerous drug, associated with many side effects, even after you stop taking it.  I took a similar one (a quinolone) and came out in a terrible rash.  Had bad taste in mouth, and aches and pains.  I also suffered hallucinations.  All these reactions have been strongly associated with this group of antibiotics.  Best avoided.",Anonymous

However it seems to be doing the trick but I have heartburn and a bad taste in my mouth all the time and I don't like that at all. I will be taking my last dose on Thursday.,MFRANZ
