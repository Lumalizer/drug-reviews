In almost all occasions (2 different doctors)- I was prescribed Z-packs and they have worked well every time. I don’t know if because of my size or age (260lb- 28yrs), but side effects from Z-packs have always been very minimal for me. I’ve seen quite a few mediocre reviews here. Z-packs are only a 5 day pack and treat a broad range of infections. I wouldn’t think it would work GREAT for more severe infections like pneumonia, but no doubt would have some improvement. I guess side effects and effectiveness vary person to person, but it works very well for me every time.",Tyler

16,Azithromycin,Bronchitis,10.0,,"September 22, 2019",19,It useful to have azithromycin along with steroids (Deltasolone) too (for those with asthma). I have found when prescribed only azithormycin on its own it wasn't sufficient. Seem to need the boost of steroids alongside the antibiotic for a few days to help kick the extended cough. The lungs are too inefficient to remove the mucus effectively. Many doctors seem to not know about this. After years of travel I discovered this from a doctor in Malaysia who also had asthma - so understood how colds and infections are so difficult for an asthmatic to recover from.,YH

He said if anything looked bad he would call me. I was halfway home when he called me and told me to go to the ER immediately because my Lymphytes were at a 1. So basically I don't have an immune system to fight back against this mess. I should add that I have Lupus and 2 more autoimmune diseases. I go to ER and they say I don't have pneumonia but I have a bad case of bronchitis. They gave me prednisone injections and sent me home with a z pack and prednisone and an inhaler.

She did not drink that night and started taking the azithromycin the following morning. 2 hours later she got bad stomach cramps along with vomiting and diarrhea. We stopped the medication. We think it may have had something to do with her long time health condition of diverticulitis. This might be something you may want to mention if you have this condition before taking it.,donbddon

As soon as it starts, my MD prescribes the Z-Pack (this time the 3-pack of 500mg) and by the third day I feel almost better, lungs are clearer and coughing subsides. I have never had any side effects or drug interactions with this medication. It is the best I have ever used for bronchitis.",shihtzuma7

Unfortunately, the bacteria (I think) got into my inner ear. Now I am starting a 5-day course (at my request) for the earache. If these drugs don't work it's often not the fault of the drug itself, but of the misuse by previous patients and/or doctors, leading to drug-resistant bacterium.
