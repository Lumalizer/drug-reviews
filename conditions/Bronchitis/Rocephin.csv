0,Rocephin,Bronchitis,10,,"September 28, 2017",4,I was given this medicine after my Dr and discovered I pretty much had an absent immune system. I have been on several pill antibiotics and nothing was working anymore. I had this medicine by IV in a Dr office one time. My infection finally went away.
