0,Sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim,Bronchitis,10,,"October 25, 2020",5,"I have had a cough for 2 months and nothing helped. My dermatologist prescribed this medication sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim for my acne and after a week or so of taking it  my  cough miraculously went away. So I started googling to see if it was possible that this medication can help with a cough and I found a lot of reviews saying it does. I am so happy. This cough usually comes once or twice a year and it’s lasts for about 2 months. So next time I get it, I will request this medication and see if it was for real or a coincidence that my cough went away.",Breezy

My tongue hurts constantly, it’s painful and swollen. My gums hurt and are raw. Eating is almost impossible and a horrible experience.

5,Sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim,Bronchitis,4,Taken for less than 1 month,"April 4, 2019",2,"I normally get bronchitis once a year.  This year not so lucky.  I’ve been battling it off and on for 3 months.  It goes away for a bit and comes back.  Cipro was working but stopped so doc prescribed this.  I’ve tried it twice now and can not get past day 1 on it.  My feet hurt so bad.  I cannot lay down or sleep.  Pain is too unbearable. (I’ve only taken 2 pills)   My feet hurt when I stand but not as bad.   I also am unable to sleep, even if my feet didn’t hurt.  Prob is that it’s already helping the bronchitis.  But I can’t do this.  Have to call the doc for something else.",Jolie

I started getting white sores in my mouth and it has also made my lymph node under my chin swell, gave me massive headaches and extremely dry skin, very fatigued and just blah.  I won't take it again.  I stopped taking it. White sores are not as painful in my mouth and my lymph node is going down. Wow what a ride. Hope its better for you",indigogirl
7,Sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim,Bronchitis,9,,"January 21, 2016",33,"Bactrim (sulfamethoxazole / trimethoprim):My doctors would always give me amoxicillin.  It never did anything.  I use to have a bad bronchitis every winter.  I had one that lasted months.  My sputum turned deep brown, my middle ears were so infected I could barely hear.  And I was not a smoker then.  I called my ENT office off hours.  I got another doctor on the call.  He was older and very thorough in trying to diagnose over the phone.  He said lets try a real old drug.  It was Sulfa not the combo Bactrim.  He called the pharmacy.  A friend picked it up.  the pil was huge.  I broke it in three pieces to get down with lots of water. Tthe next day was like a miracle, I felt so much better.It seems Sulfa is all around gold standard antibiotic for me for any infection",ymous_anon

It worked and I was all better by the time it was done. In early July I began to feel general malaise with various sypmtoms, nausea, fatigue etc. They did blood work and found that my AST and LST #'s were near 1000 and 900 respectively. It took 4 months for my numbers to go down. And a month later I started to experience gastrointestinal problems which is still going on. Not a good experience at all.",Anonymous
