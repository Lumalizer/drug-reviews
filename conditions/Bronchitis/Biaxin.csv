0,Biaxin,Bronchitis,3.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"August 22, 2019",1,"The last time I was prescribed Biaxin was for a case of bronchitis (possibly pneumonia but was hard to tell without a chest xray). I was given 500 mg twice a day. I was on it for 2 days when I was woken up late at night with the worst heartburn I ever had. It was so severe, it felt like I was having a heart attack. The next day I went back to the doctor and begged them to give me something else (I was then given Levaquin and had no problems with it). I'm about to see the doctor for a sinus infection and will tell them not to give me Biaxin. The horrible metallic taste I always got from this medication was bad enough, the severe heartburn has put it onto my ""no-go"" list of antibiotics.",Jess

2,Biaxin,Bronchitis,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"September 21, 2018",26,"After suffering what seemed like a never ending flu, I was put on Biaxin. I have always been sensitive to medications and suffered severe allergic reactions that put me in ER. So I have never been a fan of antibiotics and avoid them unless on the verge of death...which I definitely was this time around. Biaxin gave me a horrible, bitter taste that was constant and could Not be eliminated or masked by any food. I did religiously eat yogurt while taking it so I did not have any stomach upset. I noticed a steady improvement within 48 hours. The horrible, bitter taste lasted the entire 10 days, but nothing I couldn't put up with knowing I was improving and death was no longer imminent. My Specialist said I had a bacteria related to Legionnaires, so I pretty much owe my life to this antibiotic. It is now my ""go- to"" antibiotic if it is determined I need treatment for any bacterial infection. Biaxin pulled me thru and I am so thankful they made this medicine!",Allergic to Everything
3,Biaxin,Bronchitis,1.0,,"September 14, 2017",7,"Prescribed this drug several years ago.  Shortly after taking it I went 5 nights without sleep and was subsequently hospitalized for a manic episode with delusions.  It took months to recover from the depression that followed.  I was on mood stabilizers for a year and a half post episode before gaining enough courage to ween off entirely.  It has been a few years now that I am clean and clear of all medications.  Mentally stable and back to working in emergency medicine.  I have since stayed far away from the entire ""myocin"" family of antibiotics for fear that I am hypersensitive.  Highly recommend staying away from this drug.",JRutabaga
4,Biaxin,Bronchitis,1.0,,"May 11, 2017",13,"I only have negative reviews for this drug. Avoid !!!! I started with a milder antibiotic finished the course but it relapsed with sinus & chest infection and so I was put on biaxin. My sinus took a month to go but the side effects I could not tolerate were - loss of sleep (NO SLEEP) , no appetite, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, feeling depressed and emotional outbursts. I'm a very happy person & always around people but this medicine made me go into a shell. It took a lot of effort of my friends & family to get me back to my normal state of mind.",Kox
5,Biaxin,Bronchitis,10.0,,"February 12, 2017",71,"I had to leave a review for this medicine because I consider it to be a wonder drug. I am prone to bronchitis and I've tried everything: amoxicillin, augmentin, ampicillin, z-pack, omnicef, etc. Biaxin is the only--and I mean ONLY--drug that will work on my bronchitis. The worst side effect for me is hunger to the point where I feel like my stomach is eating itself, but I'll gladly temporarily put up with that rather than cough myself to death! This is an amazing medication--it gets the job done when nothing else will.",Liz2222
6,Biaxin,Bronchitis,1.0,,"May 26, 2016",14,I have been taking Biaxin for 3 days now and I dont know if my bronchitis is just completely horrible and its taking longer to work or if this just isnt for me? The taste it leaves in your mouth after taking it is horrendeous for about 12 hours. My stomach has been doing summer salts the entire 3 days so far and I think Im goin back to the Dr in the morning for another alternative. I cant sleep at all. Hate this stuff,Anonymous
7,Biaxin,Bronchitis,1.0,,"April 6, 2016",17,"I was prescribed Biaxin for bronchitis. I've taken three pills. I have an horrible taste in my mouth all the time along with severe dry mouth. My stomach is tossing and turning, making the loudest noises I've ever heard a stomach make! I haven't had problems with nausea/vomiting but the diarrhea from this is horrendous! On the second day of taking this I got this huge burst of energy and wanted to clean every inch of my house and rearrange each room! (sort of strange as I'm still coughing constantly and having a very hard time breathing) I'm also having trouble sleeping. I'm not sure that I will be taking anymore of these.",Amandafromtheblock
8,Biaxin,Bronchitis,9.0,,"May 15, 2015",24,"I was diagnosed with acute bronchitis with dry cough, wheezing, chest pain, fever & fatigue. Within a day of taking Biaxin the pain & fever  was gone. The coughing and fatigue lasted a week. The only side effect was an unpleasant aftertaste which was minor. Overall the drug worked pretty well.",Mel76
9,Biaxin,Bronchitis,10.0,,"March 28, 2014",60,"I was full of itises: bronchitis, sinusitis and pharyngitis and felt miserable. Doc prescribed Biaxin and I started to be on the mend in a couple of days after starting treatment. On day 3 of taking it I felt good enough to exercise (not super intense, but enough to at least get the blood flowing and feel like a human being again.)Biaxin has been hard on my gut. It helps to eat a lot of food before taking it. If my stomach starts hurting or cramping, I eat more food and it helps relieve it. Unexpected side effect: Biaxin gave me energy and increased aggression/agitation.It did what it was supposed to do and knocked out my infection. All in all, worth it for me.",fitzle
10,Biaxin,Bronchitis,7.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"February 6, 2013",41,"Doc told me I had bronchitis, first time on Biaxin, after two days still have the bitter taste in the mouth, sleeping like crazy, increased heart rate, but overall medicine seems to be working great after two days, good alternative to amoxicillin.",KillerRevised

12,Biaxin,Bronchitis,6.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"November 15, 2012",40,Stomach pains and bad taste. Drink plenty of water it helps the taste and stomach. I've had different reactions with Biaxin. Don't drink caffeine and take it. It will keep you awake and don't lay down in bed for 1 hour after taking. This all seems to help keep stimulation down so you can sleep.,bunny rabbit
13,Biaxin,Bronchitis,7.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"September 15, 2012",34,"Been on Biaxin earlier in the year for a sinus infection, worked like a charm then, and the side effects were slight. (Just the metallic taste.)  Got prescribed it for bronchitis a couple of days ago and I've got the worst nausea, can't even look at or smell food.",Anonymous
14,Biaxin,Bronchitis,1.0,,"April 2, 2012",24,"From reading the other reviews, when it's good it's very very good and when it's bad it's horrid. Unfortunately my experience was horrid. After two days, couldn't get more than 10 ft from the toilet. That lasted for 2 weeks. ",Anonymous

By the next day I noticed some improvement in my chest congestion, but it's been 3 days and I still have a congested cough. I would have thought it would be somewhat better by now. It's the weekend so there's not much I can do. If I still have the chest congestion on Monday I'm going back to the Dr. Overall though there is an improvement.",Anonymous
17,Biaxin,Bronchitis,3.0,,"April 8, 2011",17,"Biaxin was prescribed for bronchitis 500mg 2x daily. I have experienced metallic taste since the first pill. I am tired and have experienced a soreness on my right side. I have experienced soreness on my right side from other antibiotics as well (not all antibiotics), so perhaps this is a rare sensitivity on my part. ",Mikedb
18,Biaxin,Bronchitis,3.0,,"December 24, 2010",47,"I have been on Biaxin for 3 days now.  I have very loose bowel movements, horrible taste in my mouth, and I can't sleep.

Up at 2:00 am now, wide awake with diarrhea and a tootsie roll pop!",Anonymous
19,Biaxin,Bronchitis,1.0,,"March 9, 2010",21,"This medication made me nauseous and left a hideous taste in my mouth. I only took the one pill, but the negative side effects lasted a full 12 hours. I drank tons of fluids but it did not help. I asked my doctor to give me an alternate antibiotic. The amoxicillin worked great.",Anonymous
20,Biaxin,Bronchitis,1.0,,"January 7, 2010",22,Was given this medication to treat a secondary infection from bronchitis (because the original doctor only gave me 5 days of medicines).

My Primary Care Doctor called me same day and from hearing my voice and telling him my symptoms, my Doctor immediately prescribed me Biaxin 500MG 1 pill 2 x a day for 7 days.
