He said it was a strong medication. The first night I woke up suddenly with a massive headache, and then heartburn. The next day I noticed more problems which made me feel even worse than my original ailments. I had cold sweats, felt nervous, anxious and like I was losing my mind! I couldn't sleep.",islandnative
