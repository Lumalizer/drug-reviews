0,Cefdinir,Bronchitis,10.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"December 8, 2020",23,"Hi. I have a 15 yr old daughter with congenital heart disease. In March, right before everything was closed down due to the pandemic, she got really sick. Her INR was off, was actually the first clue we had any idea something was wrong. Admitted to hospital to get that under control. They found lung effusions , abdominal abscesses and she was having SVT. Ended up in ICU on pressors, major heart drugs and had effusions tapped. Here's where Cefdnir comes in. They put her on Cefdnir in the hospital and sent her home on that. (She also needed oxygen in hospital). She was on Cefdnir from March until around May 10th. Her lungs and abscesses cleared up and she never got cdiff. 300 mg twice a day. I'm thankful this drug worked and didn't contradict any of her heart meds she's on. She did have occasional nausea and occasional diarrhea, but not cdiff. This was a very long term use with good outcome and I just wanted to share.",Kim
1,Cefdinir,Bronchitis,9.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"September 27, 2020",17,"On cefdinir 300mg twice daily. I had a sinus infection that I left untreated for a few months, which turned into acute bronchitis. I was on this pill before and worked great the first time. Only on day 3 but not too many side effects, just insomnia and mild stomach cramps are common. But geez... the reviews on this drug are scary as anything lol. I think it’s a good alternative to amoxicillin (i’m allergic). Don’t let the reviews scare you!",avnix
2,Cefdinir,Bronchitis,1.0,,"January 3, 2020",3,This did absolutely nothing for bronchitis.,Anonymous
3,Cefdinir,Bronchitis,9.0,,"December 28, 2019",7,"I am a fair skinned red head and react to almost everything. I do get bronchitis about one to two times per year. I have sensitive lungs, and when I get it, I have the thick junk and can hardly breathe. I'm O Positive for my blood type.  But this drug works great with little side effects, if you don't take too much. I have taken this many times over the years as it works the best for me, perhaps my blood type. I only take it once a day for seven days, it does take about 3 days to really start working, but does a great job getting rid of bronchitis, I've been treated with it for pneumonia as well. I have found it to work excellent. It is strong, so that's why I only take one per day. You can have loose stools, but taking one instead of two seemed to relieve some of that, plus away from any other medications or supplements for sure! I can say I've used this medicine several times in about 10years, and it always worked great! It also helps my rashy, acne prone skin while on it, that's a bonus!",TSF
4,Cefdinir,Bronchitis,6.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"November 3, 2019",1,Day 9 on cefdinir for bronchitis and I am still wheezing. Cough has improved and mucus is clear rather than yellow. Still feeling a tickle in the back of my throat. Sleeping OK. Feeling better but still having symptoms. Def going back for a recheck.,Isis
5,Cefdinir,Bronchitis,4.0,,"October 26, 2019",5,Took medication less than hour later chest pain lasting 10 seconds followed by fast heart beat.  More than likely caused a ventricle arrhythmia.  I will not be taking this anymore.,herby
6,Cefdinir,Bronchitis,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"October 4, 2019",4,I took this antibiotic twice daily for acute bronchitis and a sinus infection. After 2 days of taking it I started to have stomach discomfort and dizziness. I didn't realize at the time it could be because of the antibiotic. I started waking out of my sleep nauseous and vomiting for hours. I stopped taking after 6 days and more than two weeks later I'm still dealing with the impact this had on my stomach. I'm unable to sleep and I've missed work due to this . Now I'm taking multiple medications to cope with my stomach issues daily and still waiting to recover.,Lilo
7,Cefdinir,Bronchitis,5.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"April 4, 2019",5,Going right down the middle on this one because there were some positive and negatives with this medicine. Positive: it cleared up my sickness (no diarrhea or stomach issues either). Negative: it has given me fevers and it gave me a severe vaginal yeast infection & bacterial vaginosis that took almost 2 months (and 4 doctors visits) to clear up.,mshizzle1
8,Cefdinir,Bronchitis,8.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"March 17, 2019",9,"I’ve been on this med for 10 days, just took my last two pills. The first few days were the absolute worst... until I realized I needed to eat more when taking it. Since I couldn’t stomach anything else, I ate potatoes. This seemed to help a lot. I was also taking 3-4 pills of 5 million probiotics per pill. Once I figure out the full stomach and probiotic combo the diarrhea and stomach cramping stopped.",Katsmeoow
9,Cefdinir,Bronchitis,,Taken for less than 1 month,"September 19, 2018",9,"This has got to be the worst medication I've been on. I went to the doctor for reoccurring fever, sore throat, and violent coughing to the point of almost throwing up. The doctor prescribed me this medication. After 24 hours after taking the medication, I developed diarrhea. I, at first, didn't think it was part of the drug, until severe fatigue/lethargic took hold. On the third day, I suspected that it had to be the drug. I called the doctor's office and told them. They told me to stop taking the drug immediately. I was given a different antibiotic, but to wait two or three days before taking the next antibiotic.",Rose
10,Cefdinir,Bronchitis,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"May 20, 2018",5,"Was given an Rx for this for 5 days. By dose 2, I had diarrhea that looked like coffee grounds and severe pinching-like pain in my stomach along with nausea and lack of appetite, sweating. At that point, I called my doctor's office back, who advised me to quit taking the drug and go get a probiotic because it had wreaked havoc on my stomach's enzymes and killed all the good bacteria, and to stay on a bland diet for several days.  Another case of the treatment being worse than the original bronchitis. Will NEVER take again.",beckym

13,Cefdinir,Bronchitis,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"March 20, 2018",3,First time I took the drug was in 2017.  It helped the bronchitis but caused my first episode of c-diff in 16 years.  Will never use this drug again.,Caused c-diff after one week.
14,Cefdinir,Bronchitis,1.0,,"February 21, 2018",7,"I'm a bit confused as to why the Dr would give this to me when I have a severe allergy to penicillin. Last time I took penicillin I woke up in my neighbors driveway, waken by  emergency medical technicians (EMTs) and my mother. I took this medicine trusting my Dr and pharmacist and am suffering on the first dose. Headache, dizziness, body aches, stiff neck, insomnia, back killing me, legs and feet swollen. On my way to the ER to raise hell and find out why they AND the pharmacist did not tell me this was a crossed hyper-sensitivity medicine to penicillin!  Would have been nice to have a heads up. Bronchitis, sinusitis and both ears infected and now all of this from what was supposed to help cure me. This medicine in my opionion is a danger to all people who are allergic to penicillin. You would think a Dr or pharmacist would at least give you a heads up. Ugh.",BettieS
15,Cefdinir,Bronchitis,3.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"November 26, 2017",7,Omnicef (cefdinir):Day 5. Still coughing up gunk. Wheezing some. No voice. Not really feeling any relief. Have to call my Dr again in the morning.,SGeeeee
16,Cefdinir,Bronchitis,1.0,,"April 5, 2017",7,"I was given this drug for bronchitis.  I've had the worst diarrhea, dizziness and nausea.  I need to be near a toilet at all times for fear of destroying my pants.  (sorry for the TMI).  I'm starting to get better so, rather than feel like I have an intestinal virus I'm just stopping the drug and riding out the rest of the bronchitis.  That should tell you how awful I feel while taking this.",Heather110
17,Cefdinir,Bronchitis,2.0,,"March 28, 2017",4,"Was prescribed Cefdinir 300mg 2x daily for 10 days. I even took 30 billion culture probiotics daily to PREVENT this side effect. Made it to day 5 and began experiencing horrible abdominal pain. A few hours later, diarrhea started. I even vomited 6 times on top of it. I obviously stopped taking it and day 2, the abdominal pain is about half of what it was. Still have very uncomfortable diarrhea every 1-2 hours... Sleeping 18 hours a day and very weak. Stay away from this antibiotic. I agree it should be prescribed VERY carefully or just taken off the market completely. The loss of work this is causing has been horrible and if terminated because of this, I plan on taking action any extent I can.",RoflPantofl
18,Cefdinir,Bronchitis,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"March 1, 2017",2,"Was on this for 3 days and had very watery diarrhea for all of them. When I informed my doctor, she told me to immediately stop taking it because of the risk of it possibly killing all good bacteria in my gut, which would require other medications to treat. The drug also did very little to ease my other symptoms. I ended up taking z-pak instead and it worked well.",Sara Nicole
19,Cefdinir,Bronchitis,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"January 15, 2017",34,Do any of you people whining about diarrhea realize that all antibiotics can cause diarrhea? Would you rather have loose stools or die of pneumonia... seems like a no-brainer to me. It is not the doctor's job~more like the pharmacist and your own since you are your own advocate for your health to adequately research the drugs you put into your body! Yikes!!! Your doctor is attempting to help you get better.,Steele's mom
20,Cefdinir,Bronchitis,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"November 26, 2016",8,I started taking Cefdining for an upper respiratory infection and within 4 days I had the worse vaginal itching. I stopped using this medicine and my symptoms have calmed down.This medicine is horrible!,Lynn Purifoy
21,Cefdinir,Bronchitis,2.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"June 26, 2016",5,Prescribes this for a 3 week cough suspected walking pneumonia or bronchitis and cough is calming but 3 days into this and the diarrhea is horrible.  Feels like I am prepping for a colonoscopy.  Stomach is constantly gurgling and roiling.  Deficating while coughing at times.  I am calling doc to ask for something else cause I can't leave the house with this diarrhea.   Need to get on a plane in 6 days.   There must be something with less diarrhea side effect,Elle91
22,Cefdinir,Bronchitis,2.0,,"May 2, 2016",4,"Day 5 of 7, 300mg bid, and still having fevers and persistent cough. I went back to clinic and saw NP and she gave me a Z-pak, a dexamethasone IM, and rocephin shot. I hope to feel better soon. This medication didn't help me but it didn't give me diarrhea either.

23,Cefdinir,Bronchitis,2.0,,"March 31, 2016",2,"Day 10 my 10yr old son started painful itching. Took advil, zyrtec & called Dr. Instructed to give Benadryl. Next day welts all over, hot red rash coming & going in waves. Severe joint pain, cough & puffiness around eyes. Dr. reluctant to classify reaction as allergy to antibiotic, pointed out that he'd taken same antibiotic 5 months prior & no reaction. I suggested that 1st exposure = sensitized & 2nd exposure elicits reaction. Pedi finally agreed with Mom's assessment, prescribed oral steroid. Six days later, moderate symptom control on double dose benadryl, 20mg prednisone, albuterol for shortness of breath. Dr says not anaphylaxis. I suspect otherwise & have epipen. He's only comfortable when medicated. Bad drug!",Good4life
24,Cefdinir,Bronchitis,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"March 29, 2016",6,"After receiving this medication, nothing has changed at all! I still have fevers, coughing fits, and a horrible headache. It hurts to lift my head off of the pillows and even walk around since my joints hurt from the fevers. Matter of fact, my fevers have been increasing rather than decreasing! Other medications I have taken worked as soon as I ingested it. I would not recommend to anyone.",Anonymous
25,Cefdinir,Bronchitis,1.0,,"January 27, 2016",4,This drug is awful.  I finished 7 days of it and I still have side effects.  It sure makes people so much sicker. Not sure why its being prescribed.... Never had so many side effects on any med.  The gut issues seem to be the worst     I tell everyone not to take it.  Must be better drugs somewhere,sammisol

I have had extreme diarrhea since the third day of taking this med. it is now 2 weeks after I finished the dose and am still experiencing problems. This med kills every ""good"" bacteria in your gut. I've been taking several different kinds of probiotics trying to get myself back to normal. This has been and still is an awful experience. Do not take this unless you like running to the bathroom every 30 minutes for weeks on end. I have not been able to eat much of anything and am still loosing too much weight. It is a very dangerous drug. I will NEVER take this again. ",Offroady

I can tell my coughing is much better but now I have horrible diarrhea, to the point I have accidents when I cough. My stomach makes horrible sounds as well.

I have the liquid form of this medication and it said to take 1 teaspoon every 12 hours, but I have opted to take 1/2 teaspoon every six hours 4 times a day, which has worked out a lot better in controlling my nausea. I have one more week to go on this medication, but so far so good.",chemoangel
