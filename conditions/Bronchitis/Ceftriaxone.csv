0,Ceftriaxone,Bronchitis,8,Taken for less than 1 month,"October 6, 2018",4,"My 16 yr old son had a persistent sinus and throat infection.  On our second trip to an urgent care center, the Dr prescribed a Decadron shot and a 1gram shot of Rocephin.    He was not very happy to hear he was getting two shots, but nothing else had worked. The nurse came in with the shots and said both had to go in his bottom .   The Decadron shot wasnâ€™t too bad, but the Rocephin shot looked very large and was very painful.   Even so, it really worked. He was sore from the Rocephin shot, but symptoms were almost completely gone the next day.  I know he hated the Rocephin shot, but it really did work.",JB
1,Ceftriaxone,Bronchitis,10,,"September 28, 2017",4,Rocephin (ceftriaxone):I was given this medicine after my Dr and discovered I pretty much had an absent immune system. I have been on several pill antibiotics and nothing was working anymore. I had this medicine by IV in a Dr office one time. My infection finally went away. I didn't have any reaction to this medicine.,Krystal N
