1,Clarithromycin,Bronchitis,,Taken for less than 1 month,"December 21, 2021",0,"Was prescribed 500mg tablets, to be taken twice daily. I took the first tablet and felt a little sick afterwards, however this was  manageable but it was completely different when I took the second tablet. I took the second tablet around 10pm and went to sleep at 12am, however at 12.30am woke up to the worst taste I’ve ever experienced (the way I would describe it would be tasting like gas). Immediately vomited due to the taste, and also realised my bed was soaking due to excessive sweating. I therefore had to change my bed sheets and pjs. I tried to go back to sleep but woke up an hour later again to the taste which was even stronger and immediately started vomiting and again I was excessively sweating. Everyone reacts differently but that was very traumatic. Vomiting, taste disturbance and sweating are all common side effects, so I know I will not be taking this medication ever again.",Peter

I was given 500 mg twice a day. I was on it for 2 days when I was woken up late at night with the worst heartburn I ever had. It was so severe, it felt like I was having a heart attack. The next day I went back to the doctor and begged them to give me something else (I was then given Levaquin and had no problems with it). I'm about to see the doctor for a sinus infection and will tell them not to give me Biaxin.

It took 2-3 days to kick in but I am getting better now. That’s the upside. The downside is I have painful headaches, my eyes are sensitive to light and my eyelids are drooping. These are not symptoms I normally experience with antibiotics, and it’s rare for me to get a headache. I’m drinking lots of water, so not dehydrated. And I also have the nasty taste in my mouth.

So I have never been a fan of antibiotics and avoid them unless on the verge of death...which I definitely was this time around. Biaxin gave me a horrible, bitter taste that was constant and could Not be eliminated or masked by any food. I did religiously eat yogurt while taking it so I did not have any stomach upset. I noticed a steady improvement within 48 hours. The horrible, bitter taste lasted the entire 10 days, but nothing I couldn't put up with knowing I was improving and death was no longer imminent. My Specialist said I had a bacteria related to Legionnaires, so I pretty much owe my life to this antibiotic.

I couldn't make it into work-nausea, loss of appetite, diarrhea, anxiety, agitation, crying spells & sweats, but it wore off throughout the day. I ended up going back to the doctor after I took another dose last night, because I felt very agitated. I saw a different doctor this time, who stated I do not have bronchitis, just seasonal cough from the move. She recommended I stay on for at least 3 days, just in case, but to use Benadryl, nasal spray and Pepcid. I am on my 4th dose & I feel crummy, but not as bad as the first day.

I do feel a little bit better but my sleeping has been reduced and I find myself awake much earlier than I normally am.  But as a whole my tiredness throughout the day is improving whereas when first  day taking them I was falling asleep any and everywhere. Make sure to take any inhalers you may be on and I feel this has helped me and lets not forget we are not in the greatest state of mind when given an antibiotic.

42,Clarithromycin,Bronchitis,5.0,,"January 15, 2018",2,I was prescribed this 500mg medication twice a day when I had a sinus infection and some chest congestion.

On the 4th day I took 1 every 12 hours and I had 100% water diarhea until my body was completely empty.  I think the dosage is too strong for me and my stomach.

113,Clarithromycin,Bronchitis,9.0,,"March 3, 2013",24,Well I started taking this medicine on Friday and now it's Sunday. It left a strong horrible metal taste in my mouth and yesterday I started experiencing stomach pains that kept me awake at night. After one pill I woke up feeling SO much better I was shocked! My bad painful cough went away. But I was left with this horrible taste and stanch pain. I'm not going to take my 2nd pill today and wait to go to the doctors tomorrow to see if I need to switch to something else. Hope you all feel better!,SidTaylor
