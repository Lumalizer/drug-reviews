0,Augmentin,Bronchitis,4.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"December 28, 2021",0,"I've taken it before with no issues. But for some reason, the last time I took it, I had a bad reaction. I had it with my usual course of steroids. Nothing different except that sometimes they give me amoxicillin and sometimes Augmentin. This time, Augmentin. I started it 2 times per day. Three days later I talked to a doctor and complained about bradycardia. My heart rate is usually at 77-80, resting. But it was now at 51-55. They told me to just keep an eye on it. I got scared and started taking one per day and felt better. Then I thought, maybe it was just something else. So I started the recommended dose again. Another 4 days later in the morning I had a seizure. I have never had a seizure before in my life. It was terrifying and now I have an ambulance and hospital bill and a bit of trauma  when I'm trying to sleep.",Ory
1,Augmentin,Bronchitis,9.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"August 10, 2021",1,"Worked like a charm. Have chronic bronchitis, and if I get a cold let’s say from my daughter. I will end up getting a sinus infection, that will turn into a upper respiratory infection that always turns into bronchitis. At two days this really started working. When I felt that I was going to get bronchitis I went to the dr. And was able to get this medication and start dosing the day before the most severe symptoms started, thankfully . Day 2 was horrible, but the antibiotics and this specifically effectively got rid of it. Eat with this antibiotics, and you should be good. Normal noticeable stomach feeling from this medicine.",Anonymous
2,Augmentin,Bronchitis,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"March 2, 2020",19,"Hit with a sore throat, cough etc...thought it was a cold.  I went back to work after limited activity for a weekend and taking Monday off.  Two days later I was worse!!! Thinking it was the flu,  I went to the Dr. after a night of heavy coughing, major phlegm from this coughing and cramping, unable to have a bowel movement, tried to vomit, (It was globs of only blood!  I was taking severe strength cold/flu medicine (650 mg acetaminophen every 4 hours), which contributed to the constipation.  I had no voice along with the sore throat and being very weak.  The Dr. said I had Bronchitis and not the flu. (Temperature was 98.5 BP 117/82.)  Prescribed Augmentin.  I was alive again after 4 hours from taking this!  3 days into a 10 day regimen and I feel so much better.  I Never had Bronchitis before.  This is a great treatment!

4,Augmentin,Bronchitis,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"April 16, 2019",13,"This antibiotic is the best when it comes to treating sinus infections, I have had bronchitis for about 3 months and it’s clearing everything up! I have a very weak stomach and have never been able to take antibiotics and finish a full round, so this time I started taking Omeprazole 30 minutes before my dose is due and, of course, with food and only once experienced stomach upset. I have read a lot of people complain about diarrhea, I suffer from constipation and have been to the bathroom very often, so I’m guessing that is my equivalent of that",Gisel

8,Augmentin,Bronchitis,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"October 2, 2018",4,"Scary. I had taken this a year ago and had to stop after 2 days because I was getting really bad palpitations.  Last week (I figured I'd give it a second try), I took 1 dose of Augmentin before bed and ended up in the ER about 4 1/2 hours later with a full body rash (after only 1 dose!).  My skin was on fire.  Purple blotches all over.  Stomach upset. Back pain.  Spent the next 3 days with a terrible rash and hives.  Turns out I'm allergic to anything penicillin based (amoxicillin).  I'm sure it's a very good/strong antibiotic for those that can tolerate it, but if you've had any type of an adverse reaction in the past, whether stomach upset or rash, etc., I'd highly advise staying away.  Could be that you have an actual allergy and that it's not just a bad side effect of the drug.  Stick with Levaquin!",jarobeiz
