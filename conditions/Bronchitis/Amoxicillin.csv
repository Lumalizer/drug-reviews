0,Amoxicillin,Bronchitis,2,,"January 17, 2021",0,"I do suffer through the winter with a dry cough. Which will clear on its own, once the weather comes a little warmer and not as damp outside.Just finished a course of Amoxicillin and it has done nothing to relieve  the problem.I used to take Chest eze but since 2015 are no longer available. These were fantastic and would clear the problem within two days.Amoxicillin I have had prescribed twice now on two totally separate occasions and it does not work for me. Only thing positive was I  did not experience any side effects.",Factoflife
1,Amoxicillin,Bronchitis,2,Taken for less than 1 month,"October 3, 2020",3,"I took amoxicillin as a young child multiple times for infections but did not have an issue with it until I was 9 or 10. I was prescribed it for bronchitis but started having pretty severe diarrhea. The doctor told my mom to have her keep taking it anyways. Horrible advice- the last dose I took it felt like a rock dropped in my stomach. I laid on the bathroom floor curled in a ball for hours shaking because the pain in my entire stomach was so bad. My mom said my face turned white and my mouth turned purple. I was super sensitive to sound and light and thought I was going to die. Doctor said it was just a severe reaction and to avoid. Many people can take it with no problem but be cautious if your child is getting sick from it, even if they have taken it before.",Ln2022

I take this medicine 3 times a day (every 8 hours). I have to say I don’t how my number 2 is gonna be but I would say that’s worth it if it makes me better.",Monkey princess

4,Amoxicillin,Bronchitis,10,Taken for less than 1 month,"December 31, 2016",10,"These results I'm reading here are not at all typical. If not for Amoxicillin, I would miss 3 or more days of work due to Bronchitis, but If I start taking it at the first sign of, I miss zero days. If not this, then a Zithromax Z-Pak (azithromycin) works great also.",The Finisher
5,Amoxicillin,Bronchitis,1,Taken for less than 1 month,"September 6, 2016",7,"I'm 36 years old and have never had a issue with taking any meds other than Lortabs. Despite all of the reviews here, I was sure that I would be okay. The first night taking it, I noticed a lingering headache. I figured, I can deal with a small headache if this is going to clear me up. Well night two, the diarrhea started. The only reason why this was such a problem was because I was on my menstrual cycle as well. However, the diarrhea was not that bad, so I decided to take it again. Day three, my period stopped. I normally have a 6 day cycle, but it was completely gone. I also had severe stomach pain and diarrhea like water. I was in worse pain taking this med. I do not recommend this drug to anyone!!",Do Not Use This
