0,Mucinex,Bronchitis,7.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"April 1, 2022",0,"I think it is a great medicine for me. Many say yes and no, it depends on the person. I have COPD. It really helps this old guy. If it doesn't work for you don't take simple it as that, don't bash it cause it may very well work for some one else quit. The old guy.",old guy
1,Mucinex,Bronchitis,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"March 2, 2022",1,"First, this not the medicine if you have bronchitis,   this condition is the excessive coughing that will make your chest hurt without medicine.  Taking Guaifenesin, which is the ingredient that loosens phlegm & makes you cough MORE.  Bronchitis does NOT need this kind of help, you are coughing as a result of bronchitis. Taking Guaifenesin will make you cough up bits of lung tissue along with any phlegm. If you phlegm has red in it - STOP taking this stuff & go see a doctor - you may need to go on Antibiotics especially if your bronchitis has not improved after 3 weeks.  Take it from me, I waited until 5 weeks & my doc said WHY DIDN'T YOU COME IN SOONER?  I said I thought it would go away, but it didn't. Doc said - lucky I came in when I did, cuz if I had gone longer - it may have turned into Rheumatic Fever, which is very dangerous left untreated.  Normal phlegm, it's fine for, but if it makes you cough so much you are having your lunch come up - it's too potent, and you need to see a doctor!",Nisey
2,Mucinex,Bronchitis,10.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"December 24, 2021",2,"Tried the DM once, never again. It gave me such a panic attack I wanted to die, I know a few other people had the same reaction with the DM, so now I just use the regular 1200 mg n no panic attacks!",cfinedg
3,Mucinex,Bronchitis,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"July 3, 2021",4,"I’ve been using Mucinex to thin and loosen mucus for YEARS now. The one that’s pseudoephedrine and guaifenesin is for sinus congestion, and the other one is for chest congestion. Pseudoephedrine WILL keep you awake and that’s the one people use that drug to make illegal substances; primarily why you have to go to the pharmacy counter to get it. Guaifenesin is highly effective for loosening mucus and excreting it through nose blowing or coughing. I’ve never had issues with either version or Mucinex when taking them during a sinus infection or bronchitis infection. For a bacterial infection you’re going to need antibiotics as well, or the bacterial infection will just fester. Like Shrek says Better out than in, I always say. A person’s reaction to meds always differs from another’s experience, but I’ve never had a bad one.",Grateful
4,Mucinex,Bronchitis,3.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"September 23, 2020",16,Although Mucinex contains the exact same drugs as Robitussin D it doesn't work nearly as well for me as Robitussin D. Maybe because the Robitussin is a liquid? Mucinex has spent a lot more money on advertising but I would choose Robitussin D every time!,Renossnowflake
5,Mucinex,Bronchitis,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"August 20, 2020",16,"I began a cough 4 weeks ago. Then the mucus started. Couldn't get it up. Pharmacy suggested Robitussin which worked ok, but still needed stronger meds. Dr. Put me on steriods and antibiotics. Still mucus choking me. Tried Musinex 600. Nothing. Made me worse. The coughing started and was horrible for about an hour. I stopped using Mucinex went back to Robitussin. This drug is not for everyone. Would not recommend.",Mel2

7,Mucinex,Bronchitis,3.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"March 31, 2020",7,I'm on my second box of mucinex and really haven't seen any improvement in my bronchitis. Either I need a stronger medication (I got the Fast Max and I'm still congested) or it's not Bronchitis.,Joy

9,Mucinex,Bronchitis,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"February 5, 2020",37,"I get asthma colds that turn into Bronchitis once a year.  I find Mucinex keeps the elephant off my chest.  And, you’ll know what that means if you’ve had bronchitis!  I will take Mucinex in the morning, and feel fine most of the day, thinking I’m getting past the infection.  Then WHAM!  Elephant...on...chest!!  Cough, cough....  Mucinex may not work for everyone, but it sure helps me breath deeper and easier!!",VAmom

11,Mucinex,Bronchitis,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"September 28, 2019",23,I have Moderate COPD. Got some kind of Crud (I call it)  in my chest and was coughing and so sick. Couldn't cough up any thing but knew it was there. Took regular Mucinex generic label. Felt like I was drowning. Post nasal drip putting fluid in my lungs and I was drowning. Please go to the Dr. if this sounds like you - it turned out I had Community Acquired Pneumonia.,Bark at the Moon
12,Mucinex,Bronchitis,8.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"May 16, 2019",32,"Have been taking 1200 mg slow release Mucinex (plain guaifenesin) for two weeks and it has helped loosen mucus in my lungs.  It does require drinking LOTS of water to be effective.  In my case 64 ounces a day.  Noticeable difference in breathing and timbre of my voice.  All that said, hoping I can stop taking the medicine and simply work on staying hydrated.",Bobcat931
13,Mucinex,Bronchitis,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"April 12, 2019",62,"I’m a second-grade teacher and have had an exhausting case of bronchitis for four months now. Many of those loveable little petri dishes I teach have been sick too.  This week I’m much worse with very painful throat and ear pain and congestion.  Went to dr. yesterday feeling like I’ll do anything to get better! So amoxicillin for ear and throat, two shots of I don’t know what in the backside, Mucinex for the thick nasty phlegm, and Flonase, Claritin, and Zyrtec to alternate.  Best thing—- the cough is finally actually bringing the stuff up about 6 hours after taking a 12-hour Mucinex.  And lots draining out the nose too.  I’ve never tried it before but it’s sure working.  All that yuk is finally getting out of there!",Cheryjoy
14,Mucinex,Bronchitis,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"January 28, 2019",34,"I have read multiple Scientific studies of Mucinex comparing it to placebo. Scientists claim there was zero benefit from Mucinex. Drug is expensive and does not have any clinical test results they can point to about it’s efficaciousness. You are much better off inhaling steam, drinking plenty of fluids, sleeping with a humidifier, and using some kind of prescription bronchodilator like Flovent to keep your lungs from getting tight. In severe cases, you should probably try prednisone in the form of pills or try a bronchodilator.  Over the counter medication is a poor substitute for seeing your doctor and take the medicine that actually works!",OjaiAngelo
15,Mucinex,Bronchitis,9.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"December 2, 2018",56,"My dry cough turned into a wet (mucous) cough, later diagnosed as bronchitis. I was getting very little sleep, and then saw a commercial about Mucinex DM for coughs which is the guaifenesin and Dextromethorphan. I tried it, one tablet every 12 hours. In that first 12 hours, I got relief enabling me to finally sleep well all night. I had no problem with it affecting my sleep like some others experienced in these reviews, but hey may have taken the one with pseudoephridrine which keeps you awake. What I have noticed is that the cough is suppressed until you get close to the 12-hour period, then the cough begins. But it's productive, and mucous is expelled much easier, and then it's over. Then it's time for another pill. I highly recommend this product for coughs.",Grammy
16,Mucinex,Bronchitis,2.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"November 16, 2018",8,Mucinex takes seven hours before it begins to work for me. This is way too long. Too much money for a drug that use to be reliable.,Sunshine
17,Mucinex,Bronchitis,1.0,,"October 27, 2018",7,"I took 1 tablet at least 5 hours ago. Nothing has happened. This expensive medicine is not doing its job. Was the formula changed? By the way, I took the regular Mucinex-600 mg.",Aggrevated
18,Mucinex,Bronchitis,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"September 24, 2018",12,"I would ‘t give this product a single star if I had the choice. I took 2 Mucinex FM capsules at 5pm. I woke at 3am with the worst hives I have ever had over at least half of my body. They were worst on the front of my thighs, the back of my upper arms and my stomach and back. The itch was almost unbearable. I rubbed on Antihisan which helped a little. I even had a couple of welts by my left eye. It was 9am the next day before I was itch free and hive free. It was frightening to have such an adverse reaction, not normal for me at all. The packet of meds has gone into the rubbish bin. Never again!",Ej
19,Mucinex,Bronchitis,2.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"June 27, 2018",46,I have used it twice now. And it feels like it makes me worse. I cough so hard that my back and my stomach is now hurting. My cough is so deep and nothing is coming up.  It just makes me cough non-atop. However I'm not taking any today I'm also not coughing so I put the two together when you take it it makes you cough unfortunately in my case nothing came up,Lizzie
20,Mucinex,Bronchitis,10.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"March 11, 2018",32,"I read many reviews some positive and some negative.  But people need to remember it will work for some and others it won't.  In the 80's my allergist prescribed ""Guaifenesin"" for me.  It really was the best for me.  Then it was taken off the market for a while. Several months I was looking for something to help me with my congestion and allergies.  Found Mucinex and have been using it as needed and I feel great.",Dedee

26,Mucinex,Bronchitis,,,"November 2, 2017",22,"Jayce WyattMy chronic bronchitis started out with post-nasal drip and a cough and I felt tired and turned in early. The next day the cough got worse and I felt lousy, so I called in sick. I felt steadily worse for another day, then on day three the fever started, and I couldn't sleep for more than an hour or so at a time for a whole week. When I went to the doctor I was given a Z-Pak, albuterol inhaler (the only thing that did me any good), oral steroids, cough pearls which didn't do any good, and was told to take Mucinex. In all, the fever lasted six days. I coughed so much I hurt my back and ended up in the emergency room because my back went into such spasms I couldn't move without extreme pain. They shot me full of morphine.",jaycewwe

29,Mucinex,Bronchitis,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"December 4, 2016",61,"Mucinex worked like a charm for me.  When it ran out, I made the mistake of waiting a few days before I went out and got some more!!!  Since I have Chronic Bronchitis, I will always have this medicine on hand.  I had to see a doctor before taking it, since I am taking other medications, and had to make sure there would not be any dangerous interactions.  This medicine is a wonder drug for me.  I have now quit smoking, and am using nicotine gum.  If your Bronchitis is caused by smoking, you also need to quit.  The nicotine gum will keep your nerves calm, and that way you won't have to quit cold turkey.  When on the gum, you can take care of the psychological withdrawls, and later take care of the physical withdrawls. Not both at same time.",pcworkman

I have been suffering with acute bronchitis for about 3 weeks now, after taking all of the medication that my doctor prescribed I still have no relief.
