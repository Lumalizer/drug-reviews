0,Zithromax,Bronchitis,2.0,,"October 3, 2021",0,"I was prescribed Zithromax 250 mg. Tablets for bronchitis.  I’ve taken it for many years as I regularly seem to get sick every Fall.  Never had reactions either. The generic version I was given was from Lupin mfg. co.After my first day dosage, I had indigestion about 2 hours later.  The next day, after taking the pill, I developed burning eyes and nose!  Also sores inside my mouth.   Diarrhea and lots of gas also.  I took myself off of the pills and will call my doctor..",trmyor
1,Zithromax,Bronchitis,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"January 16, 2020",15,I would be very careful taking this antibiotic if you have heart issues. I have mitral valve prolapse and tachycardia and this antibiotic made it worse after one dose. I asked my doctor 3 times if it was okay to take if you have heart problems and she said yes. I’ve since read that it could cause an arrhythmia issue. Well great I already have that. Thinking about changing doctors now. Definitely will avoid this antibiotic in the future.,Mollie
2,Zithromax,Bronchitis,1.0,,"August 1, 2019",19,"Zithromax is one of the worst medications I have ever taken. This drug gave me acute liver damage with Liver function readings of 560 @ ferritin of 3000, also acute pain had to go to emergency, This is a dangerous drug , I took it for several weeks 3 times a week for prevention of chest infection at dosage 250mg",Smoky38
3,Zithromax,Bronchitis,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"January 8, 2019",19,"I took a total of two doses: two caplets day one and one caplet on day two. That night I had horrible night sweats that soaked through two sets of pyjamas. My heart was racing and I had a metallic taste in my mouth. Stopped taking it. My bronchitis has been going away without it and finally one week after I stopped taking it I'm no longer sweating, bad taste is gone and my heart rate is back to normal.",Samantha

I realized I needed to be seen when I woke up this morning with terrible chest pains especially when I breath.  I went to urgent care this morning and the doctor said that I was the second patient he had that took z pack and had no effect.  I am disappointed to say the least! Now I am on a different antibiotic. If I could give zero stars I would",Mimi
5,Zithromax,Bronchitis,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"March 7, 2018",12,"I was diagnosed with bronchitis (even though I wasn't coughing) and prescribed zpak. Within 3 hours after first dose, I was shaking all over uncontrollably, blood pressure and heart rate increased significantly. Ended up in Urgent Care, where testing showed no infection in my body and clear lungs. Told to stop the med, drink lots of fluid and wait for med to flush out of my system. Shaking subsided in about 2 hours, but racing heart continued for several more. I'm also unable to go to sleep now. Don't need an antibiotic, but won't ever take this one again!",Bunny
6,Zithromax,Bronchitis,,,"January 3, 2018",10,"Wow, after reading the comments here, I am thankful to say I've had very little in side effects.  Had worsening bronchitis and sinusitis for over a month.  Finally called the doc for antibiotics.  Within 24 hours I could feel it working.  Had a short spell of my temp going up the first day.  I'm on day 5 and almost clear of infection and thankful this med will keep on working for a while.  Each day I've had a short spell of belly cramps but that's it.  I generally eat a lot of yogurt so that may help.  I react very badly to plain erythromycin so however this is different it's a great improvement.",Nana-New England
7,Zithromax,Bronchitis,8.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"October 19, 2017",8,"I have asthma and recently camedown with bronchitis yesterday and ended up at urgent care. I had noticed it a few days ago when my chest was tight and my inhaler wasn’t helping, and this morning after I woke up feeling terrible with a wet cough and lower back pain from the cough. I went to urgent care and they prescribed me a z pack which I am currently on.  The second day of taking it I had a 101.4 fever, and it has been reduced by taking ibuprofen as well. I am coughing up lots of phlegm which is helping me breathe better, and I’m coughing less. Overall, so far doing good. I  will update if anything comes back",Anonymous
8,Zithromax,Bronchitis,8.0,,"August 23, 2017",18,"Overall, the medications I was prescribed by the doctors worked pretty well. I had an awful cough for a little over two weeks, constantly coughing up phlegm, and had horrible wheezing. It says online to try and wait it out for two weeks but since nothing was getting better I went to the doctors. I was prescribed the z pack, a 5 day dose of prednisone, and an inhaler. After about 3 days on the medications there was a significant difference. I no longer was experiencing cough attacks and the amount I was wheezing diminished. I've been off the medication for 3 days now, and a majority of my bronchitis is gone. I experienced no side effects with any of the medications and am overall happy with the results.",CJeanL
9,Zithromax,Bronchitis,5.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"June 10, 2017",13,"I woke up one morning with burning in my chest when I coughed, lots of mucous in my upper respiratory area, a headache, 101 fever and the mucous was even flowing out of my left eye. My Internist prescribed the Zpack. On day 3, the burning in my chest went away. But the side effects were severe. On day 3, I began to get massive night sweats. These sweats lasted 31 days after the last pill I took. My blood sugar level also rose to prediabetic levels. My glucose was tested at 115, then 108. My blood pressure and heart beat rocketed for well over a month before it subsided. I would say that my body did not respond very well to Zithromax. But the drug did what it was suppose to. I would never take this drug again unless I was forced to .",Anonymous

Made me sick to my stomach, terrible metallic taste and sinus mucus. It was like it was  toxic on my system. I also got a bladder infection after taking it.

13,Zithromax,Bronchitis,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"February 11, 2017",16,"OMG never again. Within 30 min of taking the 2 pills for the first dose, I experienced a feeling of being intoxicated. It is now 12 hrs later. I still feel high or intoxicated like I had a couple of heavy drinks in me. I'm stumbling, cannot operate a vehicle, walk, or even take a shower or stare at this screen or type on my phone. This drug is horrible. I am jittery and I feel like I'm dying so bad that I just had to call an on-call DR to prescribe me some Augmentin, which I know I can tolerate. I'm taking panic attacks and I feel I am in a brain fog and ""comfortably numb"". Cannot concentrate or think on this drug. Its the same feeling like right after a percocet, but the high feeling hasn't let up. I hope this feeling goes away soon!!",HighOnZithro
14,Zithromax,Bronchitis,1.0,,"June 4, 2016",31,"The z pak cleared up my bronchitis right away.  However it almost instantly caused symptoms of  gastritis and pancreatis that made me very ill for five months.  I could eat very little but was rapidly losing weight.  My doctor found low liver and kidney enzymes and suggested futher tests.  A endoscopy, colonoscopy, ultrasound, several lab tests and $1700 later there was no diagnosis but after five months i gradually got better.  The next winter I got another cold that turned into bronchitis and was again prescribed a z-pak.  Almost immediately the same symptoms occurred and I was just as sick for another 5 months.  This time the connection was clear - Z-PAK.",7020erh

21,Zithromax,Bronchitis,2.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"April 28, 2015",19,"I went to the ER after I coughed up blood a few times thru the day, and I was diagnosed with acute bronchitis. I was prescribed the zpack 5 day regimen. After a couple of days I began feeling a little better, but by the 5th or 6th day, I felt worse. I had severe nausea and became anorexic to the point that I lost 14 pounds. It took about another 4-5 days until I could eat more than a bite or so of food at any sitting. It's been around a month and a half since this happened, and I'm still having issues with my appetite and weight. I'm still down the 14 lbs, and my energy flags easily.

The fact is, that although the triggering mechanism that brought on the bronchitis may be a virus, a secondary infection of bacteria is common. My entire family had bronchitis for several weeks.  Zithromax will get rid of it in most cases.  Don't believe the nonsense that you don't need antibiotics- after a couple of weeks of this, go get some Zithromax.  It works!",Anonymous
