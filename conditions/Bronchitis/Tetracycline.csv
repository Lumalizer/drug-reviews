1,Tetracycline,Bronchitis,9,Taken for 10 years or more,"September 7, 2020",1,Taken tetracycline with a codeine based cough syrup. The tetracycline takes exactly 3 days to start to work for the bronchitis but feel 70-80% better. The codeine is to ease cough until the Tetracycline starts to work. Have used it for 40 years and seems to be the most effective.Side effects- it depletes the fluid and causes joint problems with prolonged use. Knees are a mess but I could breath for years.,Breathless
