0,Cefuroxime,Bronchitis,,Taken for less than 1 month,"January 5, 2020",2,"My second day in, I feel like I’m not getting any better. Chills and fever have gone away but still coughing heavily and feeling really tired. Also no appetite really. Maybe I just need to finish the course.",Vuv
1,Cefuroxime,Bronchitis,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"November 15, 2019",4,I get bronchitis at least once a year. Z pak stopped working a couple of years ago and my dr has used this antibiotic cefuroxime the last 2 times I have come down with bronchitis. Both times it has significantly helped by the second day.  I have not experienced any side effects from this med. So thankful for this antibiotic.,Twin mom
2,Cefuroxime,Bronchitis,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"October 18, 2019",2,"I usually get bronchitis every year which requires a trip to the Doctor who prescribes puffers & drugs like Bactrim.This time I was prescribed Cefuroxime, generic name Zinnat here in Australia.I took 2 with dinner at night then 2 with breaky and started to feel good from my almost comatose state.  I found it to be really effective, thank you for this drug.  My night sweats stopped, no more saturated sheets through the night.  On the mend.",Linz
3,Cefuroxime,Bronchitis,9.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"November 29, 2018",8,I’ve taken this twice - last year I had a sinus infection that spread to my eyes and ears as well as a respiratory infection. After multiple visits to urgent care I was given a z pack which did nothing and the infection continued to worsen. After 5 weeks of suffering I was given Ceftin 250 I felt better in 2 days. It was like a miracle! I wanted to kiss the doctors feet! This season I caught a cold which went to my chest — resulting in Bronchitis. After two weeks I caved and went to the doc who prescribed Ceftin 500. After two doses I feel I’m on the mend. This stuff is truly a miracle drug for me. I get a yeast infection with every antibiotic but if I take a probiotic and stay ahead of it I’m fine. Take this drug with food. Probiotic or yogurt a few hours after each dose is a good idea. I’ve not had any adverse side effects though I’ve heard this drug can be harder for the elderly to tolerate. I’m 35/F so fairly young and generally very healthy.,Skiergirl
4,Cefuroxime,Bronchitis,5.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"December 27, 2017",0,"I get bronchitis every year and so I can see it coming a mile away.  I have routinely been prescribed a Z-Pack which clears me up on Day 3 of 5 if not earlier.  For some reason, this time, a different doctor from the same practice prescribed Cefuroxime Axetil 250 mg x2 daily for 10 days.  I went backwards before forwards, it took several days to clear me (even though I got it treated early as usual), and left me lethargic....more so than the shortness of breath itself.  Maybe the doctor was concerned that the Z-Packs would start to lose effect for me but I will take that chance in the future.",Patrick M
5,Cefuroxime,Bronchitis,1.0,,"December 18, 2017",3,"Was prescribed this with prednisolone for bronchitis while on a work trip. Worst experience ever. After three days, continued with a fever, chills, non productive cough, and an increasing tightness in my chest. Turns out, the prednisolone was masking an allergic reaction to this drug, though I had never had any prior reaction. Within 10 hours of the final dose of prednisolone, full blown anaphylaxis set in, along with an obvious trip to the ER, and wound up contracting pneumonia from all the fluid buildup from the reaction. Now I'm left with steroid and rescue inhalers, a different antibiotic, a prescription antihistamine until this stuff is fully out of my system, and a set of epipens to carry around if this ever happens again.",Anonymous
6,Cefuroxime,Bronchitis,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"March 29, 2015",2,I took this medicine at night and when I got up in the morning my lips had a white film on them and I pulled it off. I looked in the mirror and there was this white film on and inside my mouth.There was a thick coating on my tongue that resembled spongy like material. I stopped taking the medicine.,Anonymous
7,Cefuroxime,Bronchitis,6.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"February 4, 2015",3,"One of the best antibiotics for me...I was amazed how well it worked.  Down side: taste is horrible but that's probably why it's so good.My side effects were plentiful but the risks outweighed the bad...My biggest side effect was nausea and vomiting there were lots of moments I had to run to a bathroom or get out of a moving vehicle....With all that, I'm still grateful. I was sicker then ever before.I slept last night fully for the first time in almost 3 weeks... If like me one of your symptoms are no appetite either force feed yourself or find an alternative with your doctor.I'm sure being able to eat would've helped ease my stomach.Feel better.Had some dizziness and vaginitis..",Bronchitis :(
8,Cefuroxime,Bronchitis,10.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"August 7, 2012",42,Ceftin (cefuroxime):I started taking Ceftin for Bronchitis and I felt better within 2 days. I stayed on it for 6 weeks and my sinus condition and ETD symptoms went away after 4 years. This was a miracle for me.,CathyA

10,Cefuroxime,Bronchitis,2.0,,"October 25, 2009",44,"Ceftin (cefuroxime):After taking Ceftin (Cefuroxime) for 3 days, my throat swelled and my chest became more constricted. It felt as though I could not swallow well. I was dizzy, and anxious. I consulted the pharmacist who told me to take a Benadryl and if I didn't improve quickly, to get myself to the hospital. Within 5 minutes of taking the Benadryl I could feel my throat relaxing. After relating this situation to my daughter, she told me she had a similar experience with this drug when it was prescribed for her a year ago. ",sammeesue
