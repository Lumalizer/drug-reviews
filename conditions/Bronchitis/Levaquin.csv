1,Levaquin,Bronchitis,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"December 10, 2020",2,10 years ago.  No history of anxiety problems before.  However after 2 days of Levaquin was rushed by ambulance to ER because I was having a huge anxiety episode.  I felt like I wanted to jump out of my skin and just run and run!  The ER Dr said Levaquin was too harsh a drug for my bronchitis symptoms and to Never take Levaquin again!!! It was considered as an accidental overdose!  10 yrs later I still have occasional anxiety episodes which I now take meds for!  Worst med!,Queta

Doctor prescribed Doxycycline which proved ineffective. Second and final prescription of Levaquin was totally effective and stopped the condition cold in its tracks, even without the doxycycline. No side effects encountered. I had suffered from a diagnosed pneumonia a few years earlier. It was like having Bronchitis, but worse. Signs and symptoms were similar, but worse.

I have bronchitis but since I tend to get that, it easily accelerates into pneumonia.  I can't take anything besides Levaquin either.  I am so sensitive to meds.  Well, my advice is STAY IN BED and drink TONS and tons of water.  Don't let the side effects (my tendons started acting up and DO put your feet up on a pillow for that...) worry you unless you have a particularly extreme reaction.  Just ""go with the flow"".  It makes me sleep = no insomnia!  Get out the old movies, the western novels and keeps the lights LOW in your QUIET room.  It's worth it.  This drug has saved my life.",Puffbutton

15,Levaquin,Bronchitis,,,"January 17, 2018",5,I was diagnosed with bronchitis today and given this for the first time. After reading the very long scary list of side effects and these reviews I am not taking it.  I didn’t see my regular doctor and I think they just give you their drug of choice. He also gave me steroid shot and oral pack and Rosephin shot. I have Bactrim so I’m taking that instead. Thank you everyone for the heads up. I am 64 and I believe doctors don’t always do their home work for older patients. Even Corisdine HBP sent me to the ER With 140 pulse and hypertension after one dose. I don’t think taking this drug is worth the risk.,CPI

I did notice years ago when I was prescribed 750mg, it made me light headed, dizzy....so since then I ask for 500mg, and it is just the perfect dose for my body. I rate Lefofloxacin at a 10. I have never experienced any of the side effects people have mentioned, like tendinitis, metal taste, nausea, etc., and anyone I know who has taken it hasn't complained of any negative aspects of the med either.

Some days are better, but it's a constant pain and it's always swollen.  It's been like this since 2009, it is now 2016.  This class of drugs is toxic and should never be used as a 1st line of attack for infections; it shouldn't be used at all.

This progressed to my ankle and knee joints cracking/popping upon walking, shoulder hurting, toe and finger pain and now, the next day, nerve pain in my occipital region on the back of my head. I began reading and started high doses of magnesium/transdermal mag spray, TONS of water, high doses Vit C, juicing and homemade bone broth with rest for my joints. This medicine apparently severely depletes the body of magnesium, damages michocondria and prevents new tendon cells from being formed.

Problem is, now that I'm off of it I feel ""fluish"", my neck hurts, shoulder hurts, I've had horrible spasms in my legs and feet and not the kind that you get with MS. I was prescribed this because I can not take any of the ""clillans"" or erythamicin(sp) of a Z Pac. I have no idea when this is going to end. I would not recommend this to anyone.

I can barely walk when I first get up in the morning, although it gets better with gentle exercise.  I too have noticed crazy dreams, no dizziness, but I think it is causing me to make some bad decisions.  Do not take this medicine for anything under any conditions.  Find some other drug.

The coughing is not quite as often, however when I do cough the phlegm feels thicker and the coughing spasms are more violent. It could be because the Mucinex is now wearing off.

I was barely making it to work and back, trying to do eldercare solo, and thinking I was going to be crippled for life 6 months later.  Was seriously looking into joining class action lawsuit and probably should have, but no energy left over.

(I later found out she had never prescribed Levaquin to people, nor did she know that this was a medicine that should be considered when the first ""go to"" antibiotics don't work. Finally, after another ER visit I sought the advice of a great pulmonologist who prescribed 750mg of Levaquin for a 10-day course.

Out of all of those illnesses I was given Levaquin twice and can not understand why it wasn't perscribed more. I didn't have any side effects at all.

One year I actually lost 3 weeks of work (could have actually used more time but I didn't have any time left). I'm actually battling bronchitis right now and when I asked why Levaquin wasn't prescribed since it has worked so well in the past, the doctor just looked at me and said he prefers the Amoxicillin.

I always eat some type of vinegar foods (olives or pickles) and because antibiotics are hard on the stomach and vinegar offset the heartburn. I eat yogurt to offset the yeast infection and bananas to keep from muscle cramps (potassium). This is the only medicine that ever helps me. I had a doctor give me something and after 2 weeks it didn%u2019t even phase the infection. 3 days of Levaquin and I was back feeling so much better. I can%u2019t say enough about this medicine.

We will see after 5 more days. I got the medicine for bronchitis 500 mg for 10 days.,Bronchy
61,Levaquin,Bronchitis,3.0,,"August 21, 2009",20,"I started my first dose of 750mg last night before reading the adverse side-effects!  Big mistake.  I only slept one hour, which was 4:40am to 5:30am and it was fitful.  I feel extremely energetic, even hyper.  I don't even feel tired! My face was getting red around 9:00am and now my face, neck, chest and shoulders are bright red and painful.  I feel like I'm super sun-burned.  I called the pharmacist and she told me to take some Benadryl immediately and call my Doctor.  I'm waiting on him to return my call.  It doesn't matter since I don't plan on taking a second dose.  This is really a very powerful antibiotic and I my breathing feels much better even after one dose.  If I wasn't having such a bad allergic reaction, I would recommend this medicine.",emmycat

There was slight discomfort in joints for first 2 days and went away. On for 7 days, 750 mg. It works very well. It gave me this burst of energy all day and it really decreases your appetite.",Syney

72,Levaquin,Bronchitis,,,"November 2, 2008",26,"This is the first time I have taken this medication and I am on my last pill (I was given 7 pills - one for each day and I take it very early in the morning). I too have developed a sore on my upper lip.  Nothing drastic but, I think, relevant with this particular medication.  Since beginning Levaquin, each day I note additional tiredness.  The last couple of days I could sleep around the clock, though the first day or so on the medication. I also feel lightheaded particularly during the morning hours and I have little energy for every day chores.  My breathing has gotten better though.",Anonymous

Jury is out however, as I may be better...soon I hope.",laddieday

The first night I woke up suddenly with a massive headache, and then heartburn. The next day I noticed more problems which made me feel even worse than my original ailments. I had cold sweats, felt nervous, anxious and like I was losing my mind! I couldn't sleep.",islandnative
