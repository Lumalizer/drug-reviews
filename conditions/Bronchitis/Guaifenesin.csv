1,Guaifenesin,Bronchitis,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"March 2, 2022",1,"Mucinex (guaifenesin):First, this not the medicine if you have bronchitis,   this condition is the excessive coughing that will make your chest hurt without medicine.  Taking Guaifenesin, which is the ingredient that loosens phlegm & makes you cough MORE.  Bronchitis does NOT need this kind of help, you are coughing as a result of bronchitis. Taking Guaifenesin will make you cough up bits of lung tissue along with any phlegm. If you phlegm has red in it - STOP taking this stuff & go see a doctor - you may need to go on Antibiotics especially if your bronchitis has not improved after 3 weeks.  Take it from me, I waited until 5 weeks & my doc said WHY DIDN'T YOU COME IN SOONER?  I said I thought it would go away, but it didn't. Doc said - lucky I came in when I did, cuz if I had gone longer - it may have turned into Rheumatic Fever, which is very dangerous left untreated.  Normal phlegm, it's fine for, but if it makes you cough so much you are having your lunch come up - it's too potent, and you need to see a doctor!",Nisey

3,Guaifenesin,Bronchitis,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"July 3, 2021",4,"Mucinex (guaifenesin):I’ve been using Mucinex to thin and loosen mucus for YEARS now. The one that’s pseudoephedrine and guaifenesin is for sinus congestion, and the other one is for chest congestion. Pseudoephedrine WILL keep you awake and that’s the one people use that drug to make illegal substances; primarily why you have to go to the pharmacy counter to get it. Guaifenesin is highly effective for loosening mucus and excreting it through nose blowing or coughing. I’ve never had issues with either version or Mucinex when taking them during a sinus infection or bronchitis infection. For a bacterial infection you’re going to need antibiotics as well, or the bacterial infection will just fester. Like Shrek says Better out than in, I always say. A person’s reaction to meds always differs from another’s experience, but I’ve never had a bad one.",Grateful

You do not want the kind in the drug store because it contains Dextromethorphan ...which is probably what others have described as making them sick or drowsy.

Robitussin used to make the plain stuff, but I haven't seen it in the stores for a long time.Although it says only take 6 times daily.

So amoxicillin for ear and throat, two shots of I don’t know what in the backside, Mucinex for the thick nasty phlegm, and Flonase, Claritin, and Zyrtec to alternate.  Best thing—- the cough is finally actually bringing the stuff up about 6 hours after taking a 12-hour Mucinex.  And lots draining out the nose too.  I’ve never tried it before but it’s sure working.

Scientists claim there was zero benefit from Mucinex. Drug is expensive and does not have any clinical test results they can point to about it’s efficaciousness. You are much better off inhaling steam, drinking plenty of fluids, sleeping with a humidifier, and using some kind of prescription bronchodilator like Flovent to keep your lungs from getting tight. In severe cases, you should probably try prednisone in the form of pills or try a bronchodilator.

19,Guaifenesin,Bronchitis,9.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"December 2, 2018",56,"Mucinex (guaifenesin):My dry cough turned into a wet (mucous) cough, later diagnosed as bronchitis. I was getting very little sleep, and then saw a commercial about Mucinex DM for coughs which is the guaifenesin and Dextromethorphan. I tried it, one tablet every 12 hours. In that first 12 hours, I got relief enabling me to finally sleep well all night. I had no problem with it affecting my sleep like some others experienced in these reviews, but hey may have taken the one with pseudoephridrine which keeps you awake. What I have noticed is that the cough is suppressed until you get close to the 12-hour period, then the cough begins. But it's productive, and mucous is expelled much easier, and then it's over. Then it's time for another pill. I highly recommend this product for coughs.",Grammy

I have now quit smoking, and am using nicotine gum.  If your Bronchitis is caused by smoking, you also need to quit.

59,Guaifenesin,Bronchitis,10.0,,"December 20, 2010",93,Mucinex (guaifenesin):I've had bronchitis for several weeks now and this medicine made such a difference since I took it today. I am so grateful someone came up with this medicine.  So far very pleased with the product.,Anonymous
60,Guaifenesin,Bronchitis,9.0,,"December 6, 2010",103,Mucinex (guaifenesin):Made coughing a lot easier after feeling like I was going to die from the phlegm that was blocking my air passage. I didn't give it a full 10 because it gave me a slight headache and a bit numb/tingling feeling all over my body but nothing to be alarmed about. Oh my goodness what a difference. I can breathe and finally sleep knowing I'm not going to choke to death. Thank you Mucinex.,coughing easy

62,Guaifenesin,Bronchitis,2.0,,"April 2, 2010",93,"Mucinex (guaifenesin):I've tried this twice, once for allergy related coughing and bronchitis.  For some reason, for me, this medicine always makes me cough more than I need to.  It does thin the phlegm and helps make my coughs productive, but when I need to sleep this isn't the medicine I can take at night.  I use Robitussin DM for nighttime use.",Anonymous
63,Guaifenesin,Bronchitis,10.0,,"November 22, 2009",31,"I have asthma and believe that most of my conditions are allergy related, however, when I started taking this medication my breathing ability was dramatically increased as much as if I had taken my rescue asthma inhaler. If I miss taking a dose after the 4 hour time as prescribed on the bottle I can tell immediately.  If you have asthma you might want to try this product.",kd4qcw

65,Guaifenesin,Bronchitis,9.0,,"October 13, 2009",111,"Mucinex (guaifenesin):First time Mucinex DM user. I like the extended relief because it really does provide extended relief from the severe coughing that is characteristic of bronchial infections. The medication did make me a little drowsy, so some caution is recommended especially if you are not able to take time off to rest. I also recommend drinking lots of fluid too. You may notice that your urine smells like the medication.",Anonymous
66,Guaifenesin,Bronchitis,,,"August 29, 2009",62,Mucinex (guaifenesin):This is the only medicine that helps loosens nasal mucus without the side effects like sleepiness or jitters that most of the sinus medications give me. It's great!,Anonymous
