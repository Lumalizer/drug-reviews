0,Doxycycline,Bronchitis,,Taken for less than 1 month,"January 2, 2022",1,"After 5 months of nightmare sinus issues, short of breath, burning in chest, back pain, sore throat, mouth infection, raspy voice...my reg doctor and ENT specialist along with lung specialist could not help me! CT scan clear, x ray clear?? I was taking antibiotics and no help... I knew I had inflammation in my bronchial tubes because prednisone would help me for a very short time. After reading about the possibility that I had a bacterial infection that no one was looking for...I read that Doxycycline 100 was a great treatment for this! I had some in my home from a prior issue but never needed them! I took 2 per day, morning and night (200 ) for first 3 days, then went down to one a day for another 5 days. After the 1st pill I was feeling 50% better and after day 3 100% better!!!!! Side effects were awful, nausea, stomach pain, constipation, headache, short breath, chest pressure, soar throat, lol....but it was all worth it!! Can’t wait to tell my doctors, thanks for nothing!!!!",R.M
1,Doxycycline,Bronchitis,2.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"August 22, 2021",0,"This was prescribed for severe bronchitis. I took for about five days and it really didn’t help the bronchitis but it tore my stomach up.  I felt like my stomach lining was on fire and burning up.  I lived off of Roland’s chews for two weeks and couldn’t eat a thing for the same amount of time.  I lost 15 lbs during that time.  On that fifth day, I realized it might be the doxy so I quit taking it and called the Dr to get something else for my bronchitis.  I’m still suffering with bouts of stomach burning and pain.",LadyDawg

4,Doxycycline,Bronchitis,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"February 17, 2020",10,I started taking this drug for upper respiratory cough common cold possibly bronchitis instead of taking two pills a day I took one a day. Within a couple days I started cramps in my stomach diarrhea upset stomach and my ears were ringing one was enough let alone all of these symptoms at one time. I stopped taking it went back to the doctor it's now three days I stopped and I still have diarrhea with stomach cramps off and on. And of course you feel tired just from the diarrhea constantly.

It made me so sick to my stomach. I tried taking it with and without food and at different times of the day.

9,Doxycycline,Bronchitis,2.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"August 23, 2019",12,The first day I took doxycycline  I had a rapid heart beat and sweats plus pulsing. I ignored it and took in again the 2nd day and got a swollen bottom lip and throbbing head like a headache but worse. I find out I now have high blood pressure (BP)thanks to this medication and now have to go to hospital tomorrow. I'd rather a chest infection then now having to go on medication for high BP.

10,Doxycycline,Bronchitis,,Taken for less than 1 month,"May 29, 2019",30,"I had what I thought was allergies that actually developed into bronchitis and sinusitis. Was prescribed 100mg doxy 2x a day. I'm on day 2 and feel like myself again! I've only taken it with a semi-full tummy and have had zero gastro issues. I was told to be sure to sit up for about 30 mins after taking it, and stay away from dairy since it binds to the doxy and makes it ineffective. I've got 5 more days to go and I'm looking forward to feeling 100% again!",Momma5688

12,Doxycycline,Bronchitis,3.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"January 22, 2019",11,"I had tried this drug before in the past for bronchitis and had to stop on day 2 because of headache, dizziness and overall feeling of being out of it. Yesterday doctor prescribed it to me again for bronchitis, 100mg/x2 a day. Took the first pill last night and woke up to a pounding headache and feeling out of it again. Called the pharmacist and he informed me with these reactions I should NOT take it again. There is a risk of cerebral hypertension that not a lot of people mention. If you feeling dizzy with a headache on this medication you should call your pharmacist and doctor just to be on the safe side. I wished I could have taken it as I started to see improvement of my symptoms of bronchitis the last time I took it within 2 doses.  Guess I'll have to stick to the zpack and hope it can know this out of me.",Rainn
13,Doxycycline,Bronchitis,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"December 24, 2018",30,"I have had a problem with lung infections from childhood..lots of bronchitis. Doxycycline has always been a super effective drug for my lung infections. It can cause some intense gastro-intestinal upset (especially reflux) if you are not careful about it. For best results take with food and make sure you take it with plenty of water. I took it once and because I did not drink enough water,  it dissolved in my esophagus and caused a burn and ulcer there. It was so painful. A very effective drug though for bronchitis. Stay away from sunlight and spicy food while on it.",Bokjay

15,Doxycycline,Bronchitis,9.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"August 3, 2018",43,"Before I begin, let me tell you I have no allergies and seldom get more than a cold.  Somehow I got a bacterial sinus infection.  The doc prescribed Augmentin 875, had terrible reactions to that beastly drug, then the infection went to Bronchitis.  Doc prescribed Prednisone.  That didn't clear it up.  Then he prescribed the 5 day Z-pack.  After 10 days I still had the cough so I called and asked for another dose and instead he prescribed the Doxy 100mg 2 a day for 10 days.  Yippee!  I am on day 6 and almost completely cured but the phlegm has been very gradually getting out of my airways.I don't care for the nausea, especially when it kicks in, but the rest is tolerable.  A little food an hour beforehand helps me.  I think this is a pretty good drug.",T-Bone
16,Doxycycline,Bronchitis,7.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"July 4, 2018",6,"I was prescribed doxycycline 100mg 2 a day for 10 days after struggling with a persistent cough that was going on for 2 months. Within 2 days my cough was non existent and I finally had a full night of sleep. Then came the problems. On the 3rd day, I hadn’t eaten breakfast before taking my morning dose. I was sent home from work after vomiting it up. That night I took it on a full stomach and no problem. On the 5th day (today) it was really hot outside. Walking into work with jeans and a T-shirt, I felt like the UV rays were penetrating my clothes. After work I got in the pool, but couldn’t stand it after 30 minutes. My skin was burning so bad. Photosensitivity is a side effect it seems. 3rd strike was my throat was starting to feel raw a few days ago. Back around my tonsils and far back top of mouth around sinuses and uvula. It is slightly red too. It isn’t a typical sore or swollen  throat. It’s just raw and hurts. So I’m done with these antibiotics.",Tortoise Qeen
17,Doxycycline,Bronchitis,7.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"June 12, 2018",11,"I went to the Drs day after my trip on a plane because I woke up with a severe sore throat and could hardly swallow. He asked me if I was coughing I said not yet but I can't breath too well. After visit he says I have acute bronchitis and prescribed doxycycline.  The first day  I had bad headaches but Tylenol usually help and it helped me sleep.  The 2nd day I started coughing and lots of green mucus (sorry that sounds awful) but I can now breathe.  The only side effects I had  are headaches and muscle spasms and oh my toes when I'm trying to sleep. I've had no stomach problems. Have to take them for 7 days and I will see how I feel. I have not been sick with the flu, cold,  bronchitis, pneumonia for over 8 years so this getting sick is terrible for me. I blame it on the plane ride.",Margo

It was so bad they prescribed me doxycycline instead of z pac. Doxy worked within 48 hours and I've been feeling great since taking it. I'm allergic to most antibiotics and have a sensitive stomach but this didn't bother me as long as I took it with a couple crackers. No other side effects!,Alikay1
20,Doxycycline,Bronchitis,8.0,,"November 23, 2017",27,"Had no issues with this antibiotic, currently taking a 7 day course for a chest infection, have noticed a difference, before hand I was unable to sleep and hadn't eaten in 4 days as all the coughing was making me throw up and keeping me awake, after the first 2 days of taking this it calmed that right down and finally was able to get a good night sleep and eat. I'm currently on day 4, cough is still there but not half as much, also not as aggressive. Ribs are no longer in agony from the coughing. Personally I have had no side effects. I was told you have to take the tablet with a full glass of water and have done it both with and without food on my stomach and no difference. Must just effect different people in different ways",Uk user

Wheezing-coughing, congested head, sinus drainage,, etc. I wouldn't take this again-it's like the 7 day wonder pill they all prescribe -that  doesn't work for bronchitis for me & this useless medicine isn't going to cure my problem either. Waste of money. I don't get sick often-but when I do-I need the antibiotics that will help me get well-not the dosage of this junk I was prescribed.",Macie7581
22,Doxycycline,Bronchitis,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"September 30, 2017",33,"I think the people doubting the effectiveness of doxycyline on their bronchitis either have a rare allergic reaction, aren't being diagnosed properly, or they're improperly associating their negative symptoms with the doxycycline. I've been taking one pill twice a day for the last 60 hours -- every time on an empty stomach -- and I've had absolutely no negative symptoms. Not even gastrointestinal. Been feeling better every day. The ones discouraging use are a loud minority",Sengarden

24,Doxycycline,Bronchitis,5.0,,"May 17, 2017",13,"Glad to know I'm not alone after reading all the reviews. My doctor prescribed this to treat Bronchitis/possible pneumonia. Doc notes and prescription label never said anything about taking with food. The only thing the doc said was to stay out of the sun and avoid caffeine. Horrible stomach churning, major dry heaving every single time after taking this crazy pill  twice a day. For 10 days I dreaded the nauseous, nausea, disgusting feeling. After all that, I'm still sick. Whomever created this pill is crazy and so is my doctor for prescribing this to me. Amoxicillin has been fine in the past, worst experience with a pill ever.

25,Doxycycline,Bronchitis,1.0,,"April 11, 2017",19,"On the third day of treatment at 2 pills per day I started to feel better, then on the fourth day I felt like it was getting bad again. I'm now going back to my regular doctor to try getting something that works. IMO The doctors today are so very afraid of prescribing any antibiotics that will work that they are hurting their patients more than helping. I've got a compromised immune system due to cancer from 2009. I waited till I knew my own system wasn't going to heal itself before going in to a urgent care. Then I'm given Doxycycline..a medicine that's for something that's easy to be rid of.Todays Ds. worry about giving enough pills & strong enough pills because they fear overuse of them, meanwhile people go around half sick!.",Susa973
26,Doxycycline,Bronchitis,8.0,,"March 10, 2017",23,"Ok first off whoever said to take with milk is a idiot. Taking too much calcium with this medicine as it bonds and makes the drug useless.  Always take with food the medicine will not make you nauseous. On day 3 of the 10 day course I still feel like rubbish and coughing regularly. But I can see improvement this was my 2nd course of medicine as the first failed. Despite what the person said about pnuemonia DON'T  stop taking this as is usually one of the medicines you would take paired with something else to treat pnuemonia. If you stop taking a medicine and the infection comes back it will then be immune to the drug and all its brothers and sisters. "" food for though""",Not a idiot
