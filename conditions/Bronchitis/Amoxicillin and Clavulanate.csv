0,Amoxicillin and Clavulanate,Bronchitis,4.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"December 28, 2021",0,"Augmentin (amoxicillin / clavulanate):I've taken it before with no issues. But for some reason, the last time I took it, I had a bad reaction. I had it with my usual course of steroids. Nothing different except that sometimes they give me amoxicillin and sometimes Augmentin. This time, Augmentin. I started it 2 times per day. Three days later I talked to a doctor and complained about bradycardia. My heart rate is usually at 77-80, resting. But it was now at 51-55. They told me to just keep an eye on it. I got scared and started taking one per day and felt better. Then I thought, maybe it was just something else. So I started the recommended dose again. Another 4 days later in the morning I had a seizure. I have never had a seizure before in my life. It was terrifying and now I have an ambulance and hospital bill and a bit of trauma  when I'm trying to sleep.",Ory
1,Amoxicillin and Clavulanate,Bronchitis,9.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"August 10, 2021",1,"Augmentin (amoxicillin / clavulanate):Worked like a charm. Have chronic bronchitis, and if I get a cold let’s say from my daughter. I will end up getting a sinus infection, that will turn into a upper respiratory infection that always turns into bronchitis. At two days this really started working. When I felt that I was going to get bronchitis I went to the dr. And was able to get this medication and start dosing the day before the most severe symptoms started, thankfully . Day 2 was horrible, but the antibiotics and this specifically effectively got rid of it. Eat with this antibiotics, and you should be good. Normal noticeable stomach feeling from this medicine.",Anonymous
2,Amoxicillin and Clavulanate,Bronchitis,3.0,,"March 14, 2021",0,"I was first prescribed this antibiotic when I went to the emergency ward with pneumonia. I filled the prescription and finished it. I don't recall any side effects but I will return to this later. The second time was six months later. I took the first tablet and about 45 minutes later I broke out in a cold, shivering, sweat. I thought at the time that I was lucky to get the prescription when I did because my symptoms had radically worsened. The third time was last night. I broke out in the same cold, shivering, sweat but this time it was obvious it was not a symptom but a side effect of the medication. The second side effect was three hours of nausea and vomiting. Frankly, I'm afraid to take another pill. It's a mystery why I didn't notice side effects the first time I was prescribed this medication except to say that I may have confused symptoms of pneumonia, which I had never had before, and side effects of this medication. I can not recommend this medication.",Shegide

I have a very weak stomach and have never been able to take antibiotics and finish a full round, so this time I started taking Omeprazole 30 minutes before my dose is due and, of course, with food and only once experienced stomach upset.

11,Amoxicillin and Clavulanate,Bronchitis,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"October 2, 2018",4,"Augmentin (amoxicillin / clavulanate):Scary. I had taken this a year ago and had to stop after 2 days because I was getting really bad palpitations.  Last week (I figured I'd give it a second try), I took 1 dose of Augmentin before bed and ended up in the ER about 4 1/2 hours later with a full body rash (after only 1 dose!).  My skin was on fire.  Purple blotches all over.  Stomach upset. Back pain.  Spent the next 3 days with a terrible rash and hives.  Turns out I'm allergic to anything penicillin based (amoxicillin).  I'm sure it's a very good/strong antibiotic for those that can tolerate it, but if you've had any type of an adverse reaction in the past, whether stomach upset or rash, etc., I'd highly advise staying away.  Could be that you have an actual allergy and that it's not just a bad side effect of the drug.  Stick with Levaquin!",jarobeiz

First of all I didn't even need to be prescribed antibiotics as it turned out to be a viral infection (went away on it own) and the doctor didn't even test first to check, so she prescribed me amoxicillin clav acid. Took just the first one and all heck broke loose within 2 hours. I got an extreme burning pain in my stomach and throat. Felt like the worst acid reflux I ever had. Threw up shortly after. I didn't take anymore after that. Update to a month later, my bronchitis had cleared up on its own, but I had been getting what felt like acid reflux almost everyday since I took the antibiotic which was strange for me. I checked in with a different doctor and he said I had an ULCER. THIS ANTIBIOTIC DID IT. (Negative for H Pylori)",RememberHealthCareIsAnIndustry
