0,Bactrim,Bronchitis,1,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"July 31, 2019",8,"I hate being on Bactrim! My tongue hurts constantly, it’s painful and swollen. My gums hurt and are raw. Eating is almost impossible and a horrible experience. And now after being on it for over a month I have developed a sore throat and swollen glands. I am constantly stuffed up and congested. I honestly don’t know how much more I can take.",Rod
1,Bactrim,Bronchitis,9,,"January 21, 2016",33,"My doctors would always give me amoxicillin.  It never did anything.  I use to have a bad bronchitis every winter.  I had one that lasted months.  My sputum turned deep brown, my middle ears were so infected I could barely hear.  And I was not a smoker then.  I called my ENT office off hours.  I got another doctor on the call.  He was older and very thorough in trying to diagnose over the phone.  He said lets try a real old drug.  It was Sulfa not the combo Bactrim.  He called the pharmacy.  A friend picked it up.  the pil was huge.  I broke it in three pieces to get down with lots of water. Tthe next day was like a miracle, I felt so much better.It seems Sulfa is all around gold standard antibiotic for me for any infection",ymous_anon

3,Bactrim,Bronchitis,4,,"February 23, 2012",29,"I took this medicine in early June for Bronchitis. It worked and I was all better by the time it was done. In early July I began to feel general malaise with various sypmtoms, nausea, fatigue etc. They did blood work and found that my AST and LST #'s were near 1000 and 900 respectively. It took 4 months for my numbers to go down. And a month later I started to experience gastrointestinal problems which is still going on. Not a good experience at all.",Anonymous

5,Bactrim,Bronchitis,9,,"September 2, 2009",69,"Had a bad case of bronchitis and Bactrim was prescribed. Within a day I was feeling better and was completely well in 3-4 days. Amazing!  However, my wife was prescribed the same drug for her bout of bronchitis and found that she was allergic to it and had horrible stomach pain.  So it's obviously not for everyone.",Anonymous
