1,Tacrolimus,Organ Transplant Rejection Reversal,,,"November 14, 2009",23,"Prograf (tacrolimus):I have taken this medication for almost 10 years. I am a post liver transplant patient. I have experienced no rejections. Have had minor skin cancers removed several times. My pharmacy now wants me to use the generic, I assume because of the costs. I thank god that this medication has been so successful on me and am very concerned about the generic version. I guess I feel if it'll work. I feel that this is not to be an option I can afford to take.",BINGAMAN
