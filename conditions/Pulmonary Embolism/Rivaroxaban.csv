It gives me panic attacks, especially at night. I get dizzy, foggy, tired, nausea, heartburn, chest, back, leg pain. I’m supposed to be on this for 6 months, but idk how bad this medication will be for me before then. I guess it’s keeping my clots at bay, that’s the only positive about this med so far.",Candicemay6765

I was taking 20 mg daily. The only con about this pill was it made my period super heavy and I had about 3 nose bleeds within the whole time taking them and a few bruises on my thighs from lifting heavy boxes at work. Other than that I had no other issues. I just came off the drug on July 9th, 2021. About 5 days off of it I had an episode at work where my heart started beating fast out of nowhere. It stopped after 20 mins. Then again 3 days later (for about 10 mins)after taking a shot of Bacardi. Hoping these symptoms fade with time as my blood gets back to normal. But overall I have no doubt it saved my life.",Bri

I had chest pain & that was it. Went to the ER & they did a CT with contrast & found a blood clot in my left lung. I was on lovenox for 2 weeks & bridged to warfarin. The warfarin was causing numbness in my arms/face/hands/legs/back and I didn’t like it so my doctor switched me to xarelto about 2 1/2 weeks ago. It is a nightmare…my vision is messed up, it feels like I have a thick layer of film over my eyes,  I've had my eyes checked 2 times & my prescription definitely changed. I also experience numbness/tingling in my arms, hands, face. pcp is not worried about it. Also have pain in my calf, and arms. EXTREME pain in my upper back & neck, and sometimes my collar bones.

5,Rivaroxaban,Pulmonary Embolism,6.0,,"August 27, 2020",11,"Xarelto (rivaroxaban):I had a DVT and I threw a clot after being in the hospital as a young adult for 2 weeks. I was put on Warfarin for about 6 months then came off it. 10 years later I had a massive PE and was put back on Warfarin.  I hated having to stick to a level amount of greens and constant check of my INR. So when I was able to try Xarelto I was happy those issues went away. I'm not sure if I have other side effects. I'm older now and sleep doesn't come easily. I'm also heavier ... but as we age and slow down, so does our metabolism. It does take me a little longer to stop bleeding if I am cut, I'm on 20mg dose. But I can deal with it. No more street brawls for me I guess.The only real issue I see with this drug is the insane price and the way insurance companies handle it. You either have to pay nearly $500/mo for the drug, or get insurance that is over $500/mo that covers it. I saw the patent information. There are no unicorn tears in the chemistry so I'm not sure why it's so expensive.",Nickname

I went to ER after one month of treatment for what felt like another PE ...only to find out that my original PE site was clear and I have nothing else. Therefore, I’m convinced the symptoms I’m experiencing are side effects from the drug. Constant tiredness, lightheadedness, bouts of shortness of breath followed by randombody aches and anxiety. The anxiety is body anxiety where I get shakey... I can’t deal with any type of interaction or social stimulation or I get short of breath and anxious. Prior to this I was a very socially active person but now I cannot withstand a short visit from anyone. from the infarctions from a PE I still have lingering side effects with physical exertion but I still do believe that they are intensified from this drug especially the neurological side effects.

So One morning I felt like a ran a 50 yard dash and could not catch my breath. I waited too long and went to the ER. They gave me TPA and heparin. Had the branch blocked and right side of my heart was stressed. ICU for 3-1/2 days later I got out. I am was on Xeralto  twice a day and have just finished them now on once a day. I have not seen a hair loss because I am already follicly  challenged. I don't see anything that causes me to worry about life. I do look forward  to being off it . They said 3 months and I'm done. Although my primary doctor wants me to be on it for 6 months . That will be a conversation I will tell her no!! I am very active and can't afford to worry about bleeding if I fall.

We are absolutely certain the medication is the cause. She takes 25mg once daily. The Dr. Will not take her off of the Xarelto. Thankfully she only has 2 more months to go.

I passed out & woke up with sweating, nausea, couldn't breathe, then my heart went into a fib. The ER did a CT scan & found a 6 inch clot! Took Xarelto 15 mg./twice daily, then 20 mg./once daily.

Advised docs that the pain was mountains pass 10; however, I was subsequently prescribed with a narcotic which I refused.  Two days later the pain returned so I visited the local VA hospital.  Subsequent CT scan determined a PE in my right lung.  Docs prescribed me with 20mg Xarelto for 90 days.  They later extended my medication due to a heterozygous mutation because they wanted to do further research.  I’ve exhibited symptoms of dizziness (initially), minor leg pain and fatigue.  Anxiety increased overtime because neither of them were excruciating and I never had any shortness of breath.  After telling doc of my initial symptoms, which I no longer have with the exception of the minor leg pain, he assumed that it was in my imagination.  Three months later, I broke out in hives.

Since they switched me from Coumadin IV to Xarelto in the hospital I have had a non-stop awful migraine, upper back and neck pain (muscular), some upset stomach. My lower jaw and teeth hurt - something I've never experienced as I have no cavities at age 47; I can empathize with my husband's toothaches a bit now, unfortunately. Awful.",PoohyBear

The paramedics thought, because of my age, that I overdosed on pain meds. Once they got me to the hospital I went into cat scan and ended up coding and dying. I was dead for 25 minutes. Obviously they found out both of my lungs were FULL of blood clots, they couldn't understand how I was even still alive or had made it that long without having any symptoms or problems. Dr. Barton of Thibodaux, Louisiana saved my life by putting me on Xarelto. It is now April 21, 2015, and my insurance won't pay for it anymore so now I'm switching to Warfarin. I'm very unhappy with the switch, no complaints about Xarelto though.","Miranda age, 18"

I went through a box of tampons every 2 days. I was not able to function at work, and it was ruining my relationship. I held my meds for a day and boom! Period went away.
