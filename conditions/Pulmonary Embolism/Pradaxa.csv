0,Pradaxa,Pulmonary Embolism,6,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"May 3, 2021",1,Been taking Pradaxa for over a year I was on Eliquis but side effects says it causes COPD so told my doctor to take me off of it. So my journey goes on with Pradaxa but I read it causes bronchospasm? Wondering if same as COPD but worded different. Also my body overheats at night time making it difficult to cool down. Does anyone else experience same? It is miserable but need blood thinners.,Char
1,Pradaxa,Pulmonary Embolism,9,Taken for 5 to 10 years,"May 14, 2020",7,I have a difficult time getting the lid off the bottle.  I had to use a Monkeywrench to remove the lid.  Please take note and fix this.  I could not take my a:m: because of it.  I have been on Pradaxa since 2015.  Please make it a little easier to open.,grammy.
2,Pradaxa,Pulmonary Embolism,9,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"October 5, 2017",23,"I have been taking Pradaxa for around six months now with no problems. I just hate the packaging. It is very hard to open, it hurts my fingers, and its inefficient. Some days I feel like I can't take my medicine. It should not have to feel like a hassle...especially if I have to be on this medication for the rest of my life.",fizz123
3,Pradaxa,Pulmonary Embolism,3,Taken for less than 1 month,"April 30, 2017",24,"I'm on anti-coagulants permanently, previously on Warfarin without symptoms for three years before trying Pradaxa.  I have chronic gastritis, GORD, plus average 2-3 episodes of intestinal tract infections per year due to diverticulosis.I tried Pradaxa 110mg twice daily for two weeks with bad symptoms developing after three days and becoming progressively worse.  Feeling unwell, tired, acid reflux, indigestion, upper abdominal ache and pain, bloating, belching, farting, diarrhoea, loose stools, and lastly, constipation in a person who has always been as regular as clockwork.I took Pradaxa with food and 500mls of water and 20ml of antacid.  Bad move.  Back to Warfarin.",Anonymous
