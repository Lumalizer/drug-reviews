0,Eliquis,Pulmonary Embolism,8.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"March 25, 2022",0,I've been on Eliquis for two years after I was diagnosed with a massive blood clot in my leg that traveled to my lungs so far Eliquis has worked good for me I hadn't had any bad side effects I don't think that I've developed another blood clot.

1,Eliquis,Pulmonary Embolism,1.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"January 4, 2022",0,"If a person doesn't  mind going bald in less than 3 months, ELIQUIS is the blood thinner to use.  I quit using it and I've lost a good 80% of my hair.  So very little left it's heartbreaking!  3 months ago I had very long, very thick hair.  NO MORE.  Warfarin did the same to me, only not as bad as this!  I certainly can't get back into business right now.  I'm not certain what I'll do other than I'LL NEVER USE ELIQUIS OR WARFARIN AGAIN!!!!!",Destroyed

All was fine at first but now 26 days later I am experiencing fatigue, anxiety, back ache and stomach issues. Spoke to my doctor yesterday and he told me that these symptoms are NOT from this medication at all. But I do believe they are! Been to ER, cardiologist and everything normal. I was given Xanax because obviously they think I’m insane. Hopefully I’ll be able to get off at the end of January when they do a follow up CT scan to see if the clot has resolved.",Yaryliz

I developed a DVT that progressed into bilateral PE.  I was on 325mg aspirin daily as prescribed by my doctor prior to event.  MD was aware of Factor V Leiden dx when on the aspirin regimen.  I have been on Eliquis since event.  I do have decreased stamina, endurance since event.  I would certainly say that the gain out weighs the risk.  I have not had any other events since taking Eliquis twice a day over the last year and half.","BilateralPE,DVT"

HORRIBLE pain. 7 months later, just got into a Pulmonolgist & hematologist. The reason of PE was never found. Eliquis worked for me but I've had problems since I got PEs & started taking it.

The clot was dissolved within three weeks, so while I’m grateful the Eliquis did it’s job, I begged my doctor to take me off it and got switched to Warfarin. Eliquis just made me feel lifeless. I all day fatigue and weakness, feeling spacey and zoned out to the degree that it was very challenging to work at times, dizziness, heart palpitations, spells where I felt on the verge of passing out, difficulty swallowing, random weird pains in my eyes, ears, and extremities, back spasms and constant back pain, water weight gain and uncomfortable bloating and swelling, swollen feet and ankles, nausea, GI distress, stomach pains, and diarrhea, and rectal bleeding. Also had liver tests come back with abnormalities while on the med.  These symptoms caused my doctor to refer me to several trips to the ER.",Lola
15,Eliquis,Pulmonary Embolism,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"April 20, 2020",36,"I had a PE in August 2019. A blood clot went from my left calf to my lung. I had never any issues related to blood clots before. While in the hospital, I was diagnosed as having Lupus Anticoagulant Disorder. I was sent home on Coumadin. I hated the side effects and how they made me feel. I had no energy. And felt so lethargic. I went from having long hair past my butt to my hair being in a pixie like cut. Coumadin made my hair fall out. And lets not even get started on the weekly to sometimes twice weekly protime blood work. My INR was up and down and my fingers so sore and bruised from checks. Fast forward to April 2020 and the doctor finally switched my to Eliquis. I've had no side effects so far. And I'm so happy to be off Coumadin I could cry. For that it has been a god send. Now as far as co pay is concerned, I am on Medicaid and it paid the full cost. I am not sure about others.",Cece

My first prescription was filled at Walmart for $78.00 with insurance.  CVS Charged be $40.00 for my second prescription with insurance.  I called Eliquis and did qualify for a $10.00 copay card.  Yea!  I've experience nose bleeds after blowing my nose.  I've had dizzy spells that feel like very low blood pressure or feel like passing out after standing.  Sometimes I'm ok but, after about 20 steps it hits me hard.  I've had rashes on my hip and pectoral region of chest.  I've had to itch my arm and ended up causing a bruise.

18,Eliquis,Pulmonary Embolism,10.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"March 2, 2020",37,"About 2 years ago a large DVT was discovered, and was immediately started on Eliquis.  Started with a double dose for a short while, then 5mg 2/day for almost a year, then dropped to 2.5mg for about 6 months. No side effects that I can identify.  At about 18 months the Hematologist decided that the DVT was ""incident related"" and unlikely to recur.  Off Eliquis, but continued 81 Aspirin.  Six months later another clot found its way into my lungs, Pulmonary Embolism everywhere.  The doctors declared me ""a clotter"", and put me back on Eliquis at 5mg 2/day -- this time for life.  Well they did suggest that I might cut back to 2.5mg after a year if tests prove I'm stable.  After reading other posts here I'm thankful that all those terrible side effects have stepped aside in my case.  The only effect I see is when I bash my knuckles when working on my truck there's a little bit of extra bleeding -- probably good in the long run as it washes the wound.",BerkshireBear

Eliquis was prescribed immediately and fairly quickly stopped new clots from forming.  The existing clot that was throwing off small clots disappeared over a few months.  I had no side effects other than it somehow seemed easy to bruise the back of my right hand, but those would go away within a week.I discontinued the Eliquis.  Then, about a year and a half later had right leg swelling, which turned out to be a vein problem and a blood clot again.  Back on Eliquis and that has now resolved.

As I was trying to explain my symptoms I was slurring when I talked, plus I was very confused. She ordered a bunch of blood tests and a CT scan of my head.About an hour after seeing her my phone rang. It was my doctor telling me that I have to get to the ER right away. She told me that the blood test was positive for blood clots. While at the ER I was given a CT scan of my lungs. The tests showed that I have a blood clot in both of my lungs. The doctor put me on Eliquist. I am not pleased with the side effects. I have been having shortness of breath and horrible heart burn.
