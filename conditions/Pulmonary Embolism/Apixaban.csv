I hated the side effects and how they made me feel. I had no energy. And felt so lethargic. I went from having long hair past my butt to my hair being in a pixie like cut. Coumadin made my hair fall out. And lets not even get started on the weekly to sometimes twice weekly protime blood work. My INR was up and down and my fingers so sore and bruised from checks. Fast forward to April 2020 and the doctor finally switched my to Eliquis. I've had no side effects so far. And I'm so happy to be off Coumadin I could cry. For that it has been a god send.

Started with a double dose for a short while, then 5mg 2/day for almost a year, then dropped to 2.5mg for about 6 months. No side effects that I can identify.  At about 18 months the Hematologist decided that the DVT was ""incident related"" and unlikely to recur.  Off Eliquis, but continued 81 Aspirin.  Six months later another clot found its way into my lungs, Pulmonary Embolism everywhere.  The doctors declared me ""a clotter"", and put me back on Eliquis at 5mg 2/day -- this time for life.  Well they did suggest that I might cut back to 2.5mg after a year if tests prove I'm stable.  After reading other posts here I'm thankful that all those terrible side effects have stepped aside in my case.  The only effect I see is when I bash my knuckles when working on my truck there's a little bit of extra bleeding -- probably good in the long run as it washes the wound.",BerkshireBear
