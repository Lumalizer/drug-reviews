1,Cyanocobalamin,Pernicious Anemia,10,Taken for 5 to 10 years,"July 17, 2018",17,"Nascobal (cyanocobalamin):I was given the option of B12 shots or Nascobal nasal spray to maintain my B12 levels after being diagnosed with pernicious anemia. I chose Nasobal and have been using it for 5 years now. I administer once every 7 to 10 days. Very easy and much better than shots. I do sometimes get a mild headache a couple of days after taking it. But, that's not enough to deter me from using it.",TT
