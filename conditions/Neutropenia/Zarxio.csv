It effectively jolted the bone marrow back to woking properly; blood counts have remained in the normal range for the eight months since my treatment.,Jessamine
1,Zarxio,Neutropenia,5,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"May 25, 2018",3,"I was changed from neutprogen to zarxio by insurance company.  I have had to take 6 shots in about 3 months due to low neutrophil count.  I have had several bone marrow tests which point to autoimmune neutropenia.  Seems to have developed several years after banked bone and metal were placed in my neck during fusions.Not sure if it works as well as neutprogen, but was told it is the same med.",BJ
