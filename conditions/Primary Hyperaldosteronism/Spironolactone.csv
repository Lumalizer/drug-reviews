0,Spironolactone,Primary Hyperaldosteronism,9,,"June 14, 2020",14,After being diagnosed with hypertension after the birth of our youngest daughter my doctor quickly realized none of the drugs he tried to prescribe me to control my bp seemed to work. My bp ranged anywhere from 170/90- 215/110 and as a 39 year old female he could not figure out why this would happen to me. My primary care sent me to a cardiologist who tested everything under the sun and found nothing. So by chance he then sent me to an endocrinologist and upon receiving the results of the excessive testing they ran I was found to have primary hyperaldosteronism. I was placed on spironolactone and within 2 weeks my bp went down quite a bit. Over the next  6 weeks the spironolactone was titrated up to 50mg in the morning and 50mg at night. My BP is now 115/75 and my potassium is normal. My one side effect is prolonged menstruation which started once my dose was raised. This medication is truly a life saver ,Jade

2,Spironolactone,Primary Hyperaldosteronism,10,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"August 26, 2013",44,"I had a bleed in my brain a year ago from hypertension we did not know I had. I was on 5 different blood pressure medicines and could get my blood pressure no lower then 148/88. We checked for hyperaldosterone, which I was found to have.I started on Aldactone 25mg and saw my lower legs, stomach and even face swelling go down. My BP is 120/70 and lower. We take it daily with a hospital device. I also take Lasix three times a week. I am female 59 yrs old.","registered nurse,mom two twins"
3,Spironolactone,Primary Hyperaldosteronism,10,,"February 19, 2010",45,"This truly is a miracle drug! About a year an a half ago I experienced suddenly high blood pressure that was on average 150-170/90-110, which in a healthy, then 19 year old female was strange. I tried Amlodipine, Metoprolol, Clonidine, Verapamil, and Lisinopril for blood pressure and none of them did a thing to my blood pressure.When I was on the maximum dosage of a med that is known to raise potassium levels, and mine were still low, they suspected Primary Hyperaldosteronism. They prescribed 50 mg of Spironolactone to aid in diagnosis, told me it could take up to three weeks to lower my blood pressure, but on the third day of taking it my blood pressure was down to an amazing 100/64. It now runs 90s/60s on average. Great medication!",Anonymous
4,Spironolactone,Primary Hyperaldosteronism,9,,"September 2, 2009",56,"Aldactone (spironolactone):The effect on blood pressure normalization is almost magic. However, after many years of use, the drop in testosterone has been significant. The drop in libido and desire caused a relationship to fail and the low testosterone aggravated a weight gain problem. By utilizing topical testosterone supplements, libido is much improved and weight loss is possible again.",lunatik96
5,Spironolactone,Primary Hyperaldosteronism,9,,"July 12, 2009",40,"I too have found Spironolactone to be a miracle drug for me. After 20 years of treatment for hypertension, I was taking three different anti-hypertensives and four large Potassium pills per day, and yet there was significant edema, especially in the lower legs, and my blood pressure at best was 150/90. I am now taking 100 mg of Spironolactone and 80 mg of Diovan (no Potassium). My ankles are slim and trim, my Potassium level is in the normal range and blood pressure is around 120/80. I experienced some breast development and tenderness, but that is now under control after my GP added Tamoxifen to my treatment regimen. I am also taking Lipitor, Androgel and Byetta, and have reversed the 30% weight gain of the past 20 years. I am a 69 year old male.",Anonymous
6,Spironolactone,Primary Hyperaldosteronism,9,,"July 2, 2008",46,"This medication worked wonders for me.  I had virtually untreatable hypertension for nearly ten years.  Once I was diagnosed with hyperaldosteronism and placed on Spironaldactone, my blood pressure returned to normal limits in a matter of weeks.Side effects are significant and something of a nuisance, but have no detrimental effects on actual health or level of activity.",Widowmacher
