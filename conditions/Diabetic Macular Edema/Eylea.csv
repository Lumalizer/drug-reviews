0,Eylea,Diabetic Macular Edema,9.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"July 23, 2020",9,"My primary doctor ignored all the warning signs I was having with my vision until it was almost too late! He never once in 4 years sent me to an opthomologist for testing. By the time he did, I was on the verge of losing my eye sight! I was to go immediately to a retina specialist or I would be seeing-eye dog’ blind! After 2 years of monthly injections in both eyes for Diabetic Macular Edema, my retina specialist applied for Eylea! This finally had some positive affect on my vision and cured the right eye. After a total of over 4 years of injections, I still need Eylea injection in the left eye. All in all, finally getting Eylea saved my eye sight ( and having the right doctor) Getting my diabetes under control will also help. I’m anxious to SEE what the coming months reveals.",Teresa
1,Eylea,Diabetic Macular Edema,,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"February 28, 2019",24,"Been receiving eye injections for 5 years; Eylea for the past 1 1/2 years. Recently checked the Eylea website to determine side effects.From the beginning of my Eylea treatments, I've experienced difficulty breathing, shortness of breath, swelling of the eyelids; which have increasingly gotten worse, coupled with other complications.Because I was unaware of these side effects; I have had  numerous costly and invasive tests and procedures by a pulmonologist and cardiologist; that indicated no problems associated with lungs or heart.Fast forward, to the present; my records of Eylea injections correlate with breathing difficulties. I had no idea this medication put my health in jeopardy.",Joy-C

4,Eylea,Diabetic Macular Edema,10.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"December 17, 2015",23,"Update;   after 4 monthly injections of Eylea in my left eye, went for my exam today.  DME gone! My doc was amazed and said he was hopeful the Eylea would work, but because my DME was severe, he wasn't sure of the outcome.  He says now we just watch the eye and if I need a booster injection down the road we can do that.  Starting on my right eye next month.  What a great feeling!",Sandi-san
5,Eylea,Diabetic Macular Edema,10.0,,"September 23, 2015",27,"I was receiving Avastin for Diabetic Macular Edema in both eyes, with left eye being the worst of the two.  After 4 injections, no improvement, and left eye significantly worse!  I was so upset.  My doc recommended Eylea to try first in the left eye.  It's amazing.  Just had second injection today (yeah, they are no picnic, but worth it to see!), and this stuff is awesome.  I was reading 3 lines better than with the Avastin!  Also, Regeneron has me on a program where I pay only $5 for each injection, so I am mightily happy!",Sandi-San
6,Eylea,Diabetic Macular Edema,9.0,,"March 7, 2015",29,"My husband just completed a 3 year study. He had significant improvement. He was able to read several new lines on the eye chart. Initially when we started we had only hoped to stabilize and prevent further loss of vision. It was a blessing to have so much improvement. The shots do hurt and sometimes cause a very bloodshot eye, better that though than vision loss caused by laser treatment.",fish4fun
