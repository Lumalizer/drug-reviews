0,Methylprednisolone,Multiple Sclerosis,8,,"January 13, 2020",10,"I am 63 and have had MS since 1992. Started with numbness from neck down for 2 years... then optic neuritis in 97 where I first discovered Methylprednisolone and how it saved my eyesight. After that tried interferon (paid $18,000 per year) nope... Failed...I have been through numerous relapses  from dizziness confusion (the worst if you ask me), optic neuritis twice, astigmatism 6 months... I couldn’t  walk more than a few times (and I know I have it easy compared to some) but  there are only 2 things I feel that have helped me... One is diet ( Dr. Gregor) and the other is Methylprednisolone... There is soooo much more to this story... Especially my screwups... If I just got this disease and know what I have learned I would read or watch Dr Gregor info on Dr Swank 5-7 minute video... And use methylprednisolone only when I really had to... It’s not perfect but will help you while you do the research and figure this out... Here is wishing you the best...",Anonymous
