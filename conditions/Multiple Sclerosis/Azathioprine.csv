1,Azathioprine,Multiple Sclerosis,8,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"April 5, 2015",4,"I have spasms which is slowly making me less able to walk. I took azathioprine for 3 years, on 150mg per day(gradual increase), with no side effects, normal blood counts and no feelings of good or bad effects. After 3 years, I think the tablets have slowed my disability decline.",pat hen
