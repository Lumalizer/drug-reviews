After using different therapies for years I was going downhill fast. I decided to start Tysabri.  I just had my 103rd infusion.  Not positive for the JC virus yet, which is tested monthly.  My liver function is good.  And, not only have I not had any relapses, I've also had lesions disappear!  I just wanted to share my miracle drug testimony of 8.5 years.  I cannot tell you how much it's changed my life!  I'm walking again and haven't had any occipital neuralgia.  I'm done adding symptoms of ms to my life.

In April I was in the hospital 2 times. July I contracted Meningitis and was hospitalized for 8 days sent home with a picc line to infuse myself for 6 days. Then again in November I contracted Meningitis again stayed 6 days this time and came home with a picc again. This medication worked good with slowing down the progression of my lesions but it killed my immune system.  My doctor has taken me off the medication.

7,Tysabri,Multiple Sclerosis,9.0,,"November 28, 2019",7,"Copaxion was first medication for two years, after 2015 definitive diagnosis of MS, but had horrible injection site side effects and more lesions. The first two infusions I felt good and some of my symptoms had eased since I had a relapse while off meds. The fifth infusion I had chills and fever for a few days and that hasn’t happened again. The worst side effect experienced is tiredness for several days and sometimes chills. I use a cane from time to time for balance and weakness. I won’t know if Tysabri is working until February MRI, and am hopeful For no new lesions. This medication is better than all the horrible injections. I do get depression after as well, but take a low dose antidepressant, which has helped very much. I am JC negative. It is good to know after reading reviews that I am not the only one who experiences tiredness after infusions. My neurologist’s PA said she hasn’t heard of anyone with side effects.",Florence

10,Tysabri,Multiple Sclerosis,9.0,,"May 31, 2019",18,"We found out my husband has MS a year after I had brain surgery for removing 80% of an Acoustic Neuroma Tumor. So, naturally we were devastated, AGAIN... since both our brains SUCK. He was on Copaxone for two years until he had a terrible relapse where he was totally paralyzed except his right hand and he had to be admitted into the hospital, go into rehab and come home in a hospital bed. This was when he started Tysabri, July 2011. Since then, he slowly came back from being bed ridden, to being in a wheelchair for months, to using a walker for months, then using a cane.  I believe Tysabri helped him come back to himself and his family, physically and mentally.  He had another relapse two years ago, only because he stopped taking Tysabri for a month to get tested for his JC virus. He has been on Tysabri for almost 8 years and his Dr plans to keep him on it unless his JC virus turns positive.  We love it.",MS Sucks

I use my cane full time, I get fatigued easily and have seen NO benefit from Tysabri only negatives. My MRI came back with no new lesions, but I didn't have any new lesions the past few years anyway.

I have a cob web feeling in my left shoulder blade and my hands remain numb. I have been forced to go to the ER because the pain was intolerable. A few times I made it to my infusion but couldn't walk and the pain was so great they had to give me Dilaudid before my infusion. It usually takes 3  days after the infusion for the pain to subside .

I can honestly say that I cannot work full time without it, as the fatigue is greatly improved whilst on it. I have come off to get pregnant, and then continued back on after two babies. My last MRI showed that some of my lesions actually got smaller, and I have not had any brain atrophy whilst being on this drug. The only side effect I notice is slightly thinner hair. This is a drug that can have serious implications, and I think the choice to take it must be thought carefully, weighing all the benefits and risks.

A side effect of Tysabri is Avascular necrosis, which killed the top of my femor bone.  So, now I have to have a total hip replacement.

50,Tysabri,Multiple Sclerosis,10.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"January 14, 2015",80,I have been on only 3 types of medications for MS and this (Tysabri) is the best of the 3. I have been on it since June 2010 and have had no ill side effects! I started this medication with a different Dr but once I became JC positive he wanted me to switch to a different medication. I was not happy with the choices he gave me and he was very adamant that I needed to change medications.  I did some research about another MS Clinic and made an appointment there. My Dr now is still very careful with me and keeps taking blood tests every 3 months to monitor my JC number. Last month my number was .65 and as long as it stays below 1.5 he is Ok with me taking it. This medication makes me able to be my husband care taker!,MS for 23 years

I have zero symptoms while on Tysabri. Infusion is easy and only once a month, and I went LESION FREE while on it! The ONLY reason it's not a 10 is because of the black box label for PML. This was such a stresser for me even though I was JC negative...until now. I am going off of it because I am now positive and will be switching to a new medicine, which I'm still debating on. Overall I say if you're JC negative, it is an amazing medicine.",El_beebee

I did poorly on Avonex, and my neurologist has been hesitant to place me on the other Multiple Sclerosis medicines due to the serious side effects of the Avonex. I developed sepsis 10 times in 2 years. So when I was admitted to the hospital and transferred to ICU twice in 2 months due to MS we decided to try Tysabri. The side effects have been difficult to say the least. Terrible urinary tract infections, headaches, ringing of the ears, anxiety, and depression. I am JCV positive so in fairness the anxiety may be due to fear of the PML virus. I am scheduled to have lab work after the next infusion and will make a decision on continuing therapy.",Findinghanna

She took Tysabri for just over 4 years before we started noticing signs of decline in speech and motor function. In January 2011, it was confirmed she had PML. The doctors told us she had 3 weeks to 3 months, but we had her for 8 months (and one more birthday) before she passed away in October 2011 at the age of 53.

Unfortunately, due to being on the mediation for so long and coming back with a positive JC Virus test I am being taken off the medication which scares me to death.
