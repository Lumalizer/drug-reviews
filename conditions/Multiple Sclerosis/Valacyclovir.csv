0,Valacyclovir,Multiple Sclerosis,9,Taken for 5 to 10 years,"March 2, 2016",20,"I have been taking Valtrex for symptoms of MS for at least 5 years.  When I first started taking it within 3 days I could go up steps with no problems.  I feel I have greatly improved in strength and ability over those last 5 years. After so many years I started to wonder if it was really doing anything, so I stopped taking it when my prescription ran out.  Two weeks later I was having some pain in my legs, even while relaxing, and could barely get up out of a chair.  So, I took one of my few remaining Valtrex (1 500 mg per day).  It worked!  Within a 24 hour period I had no trouble getting out of a chair again.  Not only that but my MS symptoms have remained stable for the past 5 years while taking Valtrex.  It works for me.",BTerry
1,Valacyclovir,Multiple Sclerosis,10,,"August 17, 2011",31,"Valtrex (valacyclovir):I can't say enough about this medication.  The quality of my life is greatly improved: neuropathy, fatigue, low body temperature and heat tolerance.  The only side effect I have is that I get more dizzy if I get up quickly from a squatting position.",abbazwoman
