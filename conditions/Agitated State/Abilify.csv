2,Abilify,Agitated State,2.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"August 14, 2021",2,"I was put on 4mg of Abilify for anxiety. The worst drug I have ever been put on. While it almost immediately took action on my anxious and intrusive thoughts and panic attacks, there was a cost that eventually took over my life. It made me empty headed to the point where I couldn’t hold conversations with people without feeling awkward or wondering how in the world I'm gonna keep this conversation going. I was constantly drained around my friends and couldn’t enjoy myself because all I could think about was what I was gonna say next. Abilify got rid of my creativity, I was  in an artistic block for months. Awful drug, do not recommend.",anonymous

Though I am experiencing impulses that I usually don't have -- I'm basically binging in what I enjoy most, way more than usual.  I'm also gaining weight and am tired a lot, but I'm still giving it an 8/10 because my OCD ruminations, intrusive thoughts, and overall quality of life has GREATLY improved since on Abilify, which has been almost a month.",aberiss

Did not feel any different so my doctor raised it to 5 mg. I began having nose bleeds, and depersonalized. I did not feel real at all, it was so scary. I felt so out of it I had to miss work and could not get out of bed. Horrible drug for me",2021
7,Abilify,Agitated State,9.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"May 23, 2021",15,I have been suffering major anxiety and fear since puberty. It got much worse after having a child. After trying SSRIs I felt like a zombie with no motivation. I used to drink alcohol a lot to suppress the anxiety too which lead to tons of problems in my life. Since taking Ambilify I feel like a normal person! I feel like the person I wanted to be. It has increased my appetite a lot and the first week I couldn’t sleep but now after a couple weeks I’m calm and sleeping well. I’m afraid of the weight gain associated with this drug but a few extra pounds is better than crippling anxiety and substance abuse.,Pandy86

9,Abilify,Agitated State,10.0,,"February 11, 2021",16,"I take 2.5mg of Abilify. Abilify is my miracle drug. I have struggled with anxiety my entire life, and have PTSD. I used to struggle with feeling rage, intrusive thoughts that I just couldn’t shake and general overwhelming  anxiety. Tried and quit at least ten other meds before finding this one. I know it works because if I accidentally forget a dose one day my anxiety is back in full force for 2-3 days after. Once it’s back in my system I’m fine again. I haven’t had any noticeable side effects. I take trazodone and melatonin for sleep so I have no problems sleeping, and I have been intentionally losing weight by counting calories with no problem. I quit a different med that was making my hair thin before starting this, and my hair has all come back on Abilify. I have a prescription for a benzo for anxiety as needed, but I don’t need it anymore.",Notmyrealname
10,Abilify,Agitated State,7.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"February 5, 2021",9,"The side effects are bad at first - do not take Abilify at night! My feet were erratic starting out and I had a hard time sleeping because I took it at night. Another side effect: Weight gain does occur! But, this is not because the pill has calories (one review said) or because it gives you munchies (another review said). It simply changes the way your body stores leptin and processes food. Adding in slight exercise, or reducing your calories with healthier foods might help - or if you are lucky, it might not affect you at all. I did not notice the weight gain effects on the 5 mg, but I did on the 10 mg. I have gained three pounds in one week. Personally, the weight is not something I can handle, so I will be going back to 5 mg because that worked just fine for me. It might take some experimenting but try it first (always start with a low dose).",Cool Cat
11,Abilify,Agitated State,1.0,,"January 25, 2021",5,"My son was prescribed Abilify for ""aggressive"" behavior at age 6. It didn't really change his behavior. Within a year he began showing symptoms of ADHD, despite no signs before starting the med. Is the restlessness really ADHD, or is it akathisia caused by the med? He also became compulsive on Abilify, which I learned only recently is a known side-effect of the medication. His BMI is now borderline obese, and his metabolic labs are all elevated. I'm now tapering him off of it after more than 3 years. I've noticed a reduction in his compulsive and thrill seeking behavior, though he still can't sit still for the life of him. Hopefully those withdrawl side-effects will subside with time. If a doctor recommends your child take a mood-stabilizer, remember that a calm parent is the best mood-stabilizer for a child. This stuff isn't FDA approved for use in children for a reason. I'm not anti-medication and I'm sure this med works for some people, but this med did not work for him.",G
12,Abilify,Agitated State,8.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"January 15, 2021",12,I was put on this many years ago for a nervous breakdown and it started to help almost instantly.

I have PTSD BPD and depression  so with  everything  going  on it has made me insane.  I had rage outbursts and would  want to hit people, not to mention the stress and lockdown.  Everytime  I left the house  there's signs and masks everywhere- anyways I needed a change.  I tried Abilify I'm on 5mg now, I found  it actually  increased my appetite,  I gained at least  10 lbs which  I'm not fond of, but I've been  eating  again.  I find it has worked great  as far as a mood stabilizer I've only had 1 panic attack since being on it. The first few weeks  I was really  agitated and paranoid  though. If I don't take it at the exact time everyday I feel  sick. Overall it does help with my mood and rage so I'll stay on it.

He has struggled with intense burst of extreme anger. He would yell, scream, throw things, hit himself, slam doors etc. He would be angry very quickly over small things. He was very impulsive, and had many troubles at school focusing. We tried 2 different ADHD meds with no luck. They actually made things worse. His behaviour changed the moment he started Abilify, at a low dose of 2mg a day. We expected weeks until seeing results. My child is a completely different person. He is calm, polite, and so pleasant. He has voiced his own opinion on feeling this med is working. He can feel the difference within himself. He displays no side effects. He still feels and shows emotions, just in a calm manner. We have struggled heartbreakingly for a long time in finding him help, with nothing that has actually worked. This has absolutely changed his life.",Hands1

No anxiety = no Lupus. Anxiety is gone which is wonderful, but it's been replaced with nausea. It's not bad enough to cause vomiting, just annoying. I have no appetite and have lost 4 pounds so far.

He was put on blood pressure medicine at the age of 4, (hardly did anything.) ADHD medication; methanphetamine at age 5 (only worsened his symptoms.) resperidone at 6yrs, which took the edge off but he became more irritable only after 3mth. And Abilify age 7 and thus far his behavior, aggression, attention span has improved and everyone in the house hold and school does nothing but compliment how well mannered he is!!!

The time I was on it I am surprised I didn't end up in prison or a psych ward. One of the worst experiences of my life.. They must have had a good ad campaign for this drugs, because doctors seems to think it is the answer to everything. Fact is, the two trials done for the drug before it became the next coming of Jesus were done by the drug company who made it. Funny thing is, thy didn't hide in their trial that is caused agitation in a little less than half of their patients, which raises the question of why these companies even bother doin trials.
