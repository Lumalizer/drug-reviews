It made me empty headed to the point where I couldn’t hold conversations with people without feeling awkward or wondering how in the world I'm gonna keep this conversation going.

It got much worse after having a child. After trying SSRIs I felt like a zombie with no motivation. I used to drink alcohol a lot to suppress the anxiety too which lead to tons of problems in my life. Since taking Ambilify I feel like a normal person! I feel like the person I wanted to be. It has increased my appetite a lot and the first week I couldn’t sleep but now after a couple weeks I’m calm and sleeping well.

I used to struggle with feeling rage, intrusive thoughts that I just couldn’t shake and general overwhelming  anxiety. Tried and quit at least ten other meds before finding this one. I know it works because if I accidentally forget a dose one day my anxiety is back in full force for 2-3 days after. Once it’s back in my system I’m fine again. I haven’t had any noticeable side effects. I take trazodone and melatonin for sleep so I have no problems sleeping, and I have been intentionally losing weight by counting calories with no problem. I quit a different med that was making my hair thin before starting this, and my hair has all come back on Abilify.

11,Aripiprazole,Agitated State,7.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"February 5, 2021",9,"Abilify (aripiprazole):The side effects are bad at first - do not take Abilify at night! My feet were erratic starting out and I had a hard time sleeping because I took it at night. Another side effect: Weight gain does occur! But, this is not because the pill has calories (one review said) or because it gives you munchies (another review said). It simply changes the way your body stores leptin and processes food. Adding in slight exercise, or reducing your calories with healthier foods might help - or if you are lucky, it might not affect you at all. I did not notice the weight gain effects on the 5 mg, but I did on the 10 mg. I have gained three pounds in one week. Personally, the weight is not something I can handle, so I will be going back to 5 mg because that worked just fine for me. It might take some experimenting but try it first (always start with a low dose).",Cool Cat
12,Aripiprazole,Agitated State,1.0,,"January 25, 2021",5,"Abilify (aripiprazole):My son was prescribed Abilify for ""aggressive"" behavior at age 6. It didn't really change his behavior. Within a year he began showing symptoms of ADHD, despite no signs before starting the med. Is the restlessness really ADHD, or is it akathisia caused by the med? He also became compulsive on Abilify, which I learned only recently is a known side-effect of the medication. His BMI is now borderline obese, and his metabolic labs are all elevated. I'm now tapering him off of it after more than 3 years. I've noticed a reduction in his compulsive and thrill seeking behavior, though he still can't sit still for the life of him. Hopefully those withdrawl side-effects will subside with time. If a doctor recommends your child take a mood-stabilizer, remember that a calm parent is the best mood-stabilizer for a child. This stuff isn't FDA approved for use in children for a reason. I'm not anti-medication and I'm sure this med works for some people, but this med did not work for him.",G

He would yell, scream, throw things, hit himself, slam doors etc. He would be angry very quickly over small things. He was very impulsive, and had many troubles at school focusing. We tried 2 different ADHD meds with no luck. They actually made things worse. His behaviour changed the moment he started Abilify, at a low dose of 2mg a day. We expected weeks until seeing results. My child is a completely different person. He is calm, polite, and so pleasant. He has voiced his own opinion on feeling this med is working. He can feel the difference within himself.

47,Aripiprazole,Agitated State,7.0,,"January 4, 2010",30,"Abilify (aripiprazole):My 10-yr old son has been taking 1 mg Abilify in the morning for the past 4 months.  He used to be prone to loud shouting, hitting, spitting, etc. at home, but now little things don't bother him as much and he's easier to reason with.  No side effects from this dose seem apparent so far.He's also taking 36 mg Concerta for ADD symptoms which would otherwise keep him from functioning for more than a couple of hours in the classroom.  He's also taking Depakote for seizure control.  He's been seizure-free for 2.5 years now, and we are gradually reducing that dose to zero.  Eventually, we hope to reduce all these drugs to zero, one at a time.",cygnet101

50,Aripiprazole,Agitated State,6.0,,"August 5, 2009",50,"Abilify (aripiprazole):I took this medication in addition to Zoloft 100mg. My doctor had me on it as a mood stabilizer at 5mg a day. I don't have bipolar disorder, but had some manic or agitated behavior at the time (which could've been caused by the Zoloft). Doctor prescribed it and thought it would help. It increased my energy, and I began to workout more. For some reason, I woke up early every morning around 8AM while I was on Abilify. I'm not a morning person so that's really early for me. Also I felt ""speeded up"", overly confident and optimistic. I had to stop taking it because I experienced odd involuntary tongue movements. I was also on Seroquel which is in the same family of drugs as Abilify, so the doctor thought the combination is what caused the odd effect.",MacKat

53,Aripiprazole,Agitated State,10.0,,"July 3, 2008",163,Abilify (aripiprazole):My 25 year old son was prescribed this medication for his aggressive behavior and inablity to concentrate. As a child he was diagnosed with ADHD with aggressive behavior. His behavior only worsened as he got older and was not on any medication. He was unable to keep a job and was always in trouble with the police for fighting and just unable make good decisions. After starting Abilify he has had a steady job for 6 months and his agressive behavior is gone. I have my son back.,dwinch
