0,Prednisone,Systemic Sclerosis,8,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"October 23, 2021",0,"High dose initially got excessive swelling in my hands and itchy rash on my legs under control, then reduced down to a 5mg maintenance dose.  The medication also helped with chronic pain from an old back injury to a point it hardly bothered me anymore!  The steroid made my joints ache though, especially those in my hands and my carpal tunnel was much worse.  When there was a delay in my prescription I reduced my dose (took half doses to make the tablets last longer): the rash stayed away and joint pain reduced.  Next prescription delay I had no tablets left, so had to go cold turkey: I was fatigued, but it was OK.  I wasn't given Vit D or calcium though and was told I should have been as prednisone has depleted my Vit D levels leading to other problems now.",Evie
1,Prednisone,Systemic Sclerosis,9,,"June 9, 2020",2,I was 1st diagnosed with systemic lupus then it went to systemic scleroderma in 3 months also Ana pos dual and scl70 pos. I finally got a little relief from prednisone. I was on a 30mg pill prescription.  On it at least I could try to walk.  To those out there. Do be afraid to try it.  Had my blood work redone and waiting.,Merry
