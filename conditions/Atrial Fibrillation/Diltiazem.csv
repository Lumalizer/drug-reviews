Five days later it has stopped altogether. I was taking it for atrial fibrillation. I'm staying on blood thinner & will keep some of these with me in case I go into an abnormal heart rhythm. Taking it every day is a recipe for health disaster in my opinion.",CanCan

I think the vagus nerve responds to bladder pressure and sends a wrong signal to the heart to act up.   I'm on low dosage by prefernce.
