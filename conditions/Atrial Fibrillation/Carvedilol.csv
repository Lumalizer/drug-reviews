I'm taking 12. 5mg a day.   Since taking it,  headaches are common,  dizziness to the point of almost blacking out,  strange feelings in my chest,  up 2-3 times a night to go to the bathroom and sexual function almost nonexistent.  I've requested to have it removed from my daily med list.   I don't know if the side effects are worth it. I don't know if it helps or not.",Mikeh

3,Carvedilol,Atrial Fibrillation,9.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"September 2, 2019",12,"I've been on Carvedilol since June of 2018. I started off with 3.125mg and my Cardiologist just increased the dosage to 6.25 because it helps to stop the PVC's and palps I had started to experience in April of 2019. My pacemaker picked up a very small Afib event that happened in April of 2019 during my period of throwing PVC's. I started to take ""Tumeric"" to see if it would reduce the chronic body pain and ""It Did"". I also found out after I started taking it my, ""PVC's Went Away"". I saw my cardiologist after I started taking the Tumeric and asked him to increase my dose of ""Carvedilol"" and he did. This combination of Carvedilol and Tumeric worked out well for me. I haven't felt any incidences of Afib even though all the causes of the PVC's are still there. It appears any Afib, PVC's and Palps are under control but I won't know it's a sure thing for another year or more after my pacemaker is checked for events about 4 more times.",Junkee59

6,Carvedilol,Atrial Fibrillation,,Taken for less than 1 month,"November 23, 2017",16,"I have been on Bisoprolol for six years and have had severe fatigue from this, sleeping up to 13/14 hours every day.  My doctor changed me to Carvedilol in the hope these side effects would improve.  I started off on an initial dose of 12.5mg a day.  From the first nights sleep, I suffered with insomnia, sleeping for five hours that night.  I felt more awake, even though less sleep.  After two days, I started to get tightening of muscles in my face, hands, arms and legs and abdominal pain.  After increasing to 25mg on week two, I felt terrible.  Four hours sleep for two weeks, muzzy confused feelings, feeling sick, joint pain - I couldn't bear how I felt.  To top it off, drug induced sleep apnea was the last straw.  I came off it.",Yorkshire lad

I had cardiac ablation for atrial fibrillation that  was approximately 90% successful, I still had occasional heart flutter from the AF. The Corey changed all that. My blood pressure is now in normal range and I haven't had one incident of heart flutter for two months. Coreg worked well for me and I hope it will work for you.",Chris Z
