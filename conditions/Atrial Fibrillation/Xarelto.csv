0,Xarelto,Atrial Fibrillation,,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"March 1, 2022",0,"This Is My StoryI wish my husband had never been prescribed Xarelto by his cardiologist in 2017. Blood clotting factors were never checked because the makers of this drug do not recommend testing. Now the dosage has been changed but is that going to prevent brain bleeds and death?At 63 years old, his brain bleed started at his desk at work. Air Lifted to hospital and later taken off  vent with no brain activity. -Healthy person with  newly diagnosed aFib.Can anyone answer the following questions?1.  Would it be much of an inconvenience to test patients for clotting  on this medication?  2.  And do cardiologists get benefits when prescribing Xarelto?3.  Has the dosage change reduced deaths from bleeds?  4.  An antidote for this kind of damage is not a solution. Don’t take Xarelto!Widow",Widow

2,Xarelto,Atrial Fibrillation,1.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"September 29, 2021",2,"I have been on this drug for about 10 months. It seems to be causing some real issues both mentally and physically. I have a problem with localized pain in my shoulder which I didn't injure. I have muscle pain in my legs and arms and muscle weakness. I used to enjoy my long walks but now I don't have the energy or strength. I have bouts of severe itching over different parts of my body i.e , scalp arms, legs, abdomen but no rash.  I am also having bladder control problems.Some days I feel like I'm losing my sanity. Today is one of those days. I got up feeling like I've been run over by a truck. These days are much more frequent. I'm at the end of my rope. I'm going to speak to my Doctor later today but I have to come of this drug. My atrial fib is pretty well controlled with the drugs I've been taking but my quality of life has nose dived with xarelto. Can anyone relate ?",Carol

His cardiologist said that they are seeing more and more brain bleeds with this drug. At least with the older drug, warfarin, regular blood work is done to check on bleeding/clotting. Follow up reviews show that this drug in excess of 10 mg. is causing brain bleeds.",Debbie
4,Xarelto,Atrial Fibrillation,10.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"March 24, 2021",2,"I have been on Xarelto 20mg for the last 2 years.  I have AFIB and I had DVT in my legs.  On my one year anniversary, Xarelto eliminated my DVT in both legs, they were so painful, especially behind my knees.  Xarelto eliminated that crisis.  I've continued the Xarelto for my AFIB along with metoprolol 25mg. 2X a day.  I have not had an AFIB crisis since.  I was in the hospital for my AFIB.  I'm shocked at these people who blame Xarelto for their problems.  It can be many other things like multiple drug interactions.  Or other health issues.   Xarelto saved my life. I buy my medicine out of UAE.  $135.00 for 3 months worth.",louM

7,Xarelto,Atrial Fibrillation,2.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"June 17, 2020",18,Xarelto is very effective in providing anticoagulant effect. For me that resulted in almost uncontrollable nose bleeds (up to 14 hours) and 3-5 hours for very minor skin scratches. But the worse outcomes were the side effects: consistent headaches; severe shortness of breath; depression;  bad mood (extremely grouchy); stomach aches; and constipation. I do not recommend this medicine to anyone. Warfarin ($6.00/month) is easy to manage and it has almost NO side effect.,Autologous1

Then I developed arm and leg pain and some gum bleeding.  The leg pain started in one thigh and woke me up at night with burning prickling nerve pain and sometimes felt like I had been electrified.  The rest of the thigh was numb.  Soon both legs were involved. My doctor switched me to Eliquis which she said had less side effects and I will soon see if the arm and leg pain disappear.",Loulou

10,Xarelto,Atrial Fibrillation,10.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"February 19, 2020",71,I have had a fib and was hospitalized 6 times in 7. Put on Xarelto blood thinner as having a stroke is far worse if you survive it than any side effects.  My father had 11 strokes in 5 years before he died at age 58.  I have had no side effects from this drug.  Had major surgery and was told that I bled less than one tablespoon.  Xarelto has very rapid time frame when stopping the pills before surgery.  It exits your body very rapidly so I find it hard to believe all the symptoms reported after the medication were stopped were caused by this medication. I took my regular one a day pill two nights before major surgery and stopped the pill the night before surgery and restarted the medication one day later per doctors direction.  I have been on this medication for six years because of my a fib and my family history of stroke.  This medication does nothing to cure a fib but it does everything to prevent strokes.  It has a very rapid exit time for leaving your body.,Meena

13,Xarelto,Atrial Fibrillation,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"July 21, 2019",118,"The med is not meant to help the symptoms of Afib. It is just a blood thinner. All it does is protect your provider if you have a  blood clot anyway. It should decrease the odds of having a blood clot, but as far as making you feel better, absolutely not. Your heart will still be going into afib on a regular basis, you will still feel horrid. And of course as with all of american health care you will become a great cash cow for the American medical industry. There are no cures being developed in the US for Afib, or anything else.
