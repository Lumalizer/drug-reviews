2,Metoprolol,Atrial Fibrillation,10.0,Taken for 10 years or more,"November 8, 2021",1,"Metoprolol 25 mg twice a day did nothing for my AFib, however when my cardiologist put me on Metoprolol succinate ER 25 mg once a day it straightened my AFib up because it's an extended release pill that slowly releases the medicine throughout the day and night. Before I took it I had to have ablation done which worked for 5 years then it came back stronger until the extended release version of Metoprolol was given to me. I no longer see my cardiologist every 3 months but every 6 months.My cardiologist and I are both happy with Metoprolol succinate ER 25 mg for me. It works well.",AFib since 2009

Went to the hospital where I was diagnosed with AF. Not a huge shock as majority of my family have it. I was given a low dose of metoprolol  (12.5mg, one in the AM and one in PM)  I’ve been on it for a couple days now and I’m ready to throw in the towel. Feeling dizzy approx 3hrs after taking it, light headed, occasionally nauseous, tightness, SOB (shortness of breath), heart rate has dropped to around 50bpm which is low for me considering my usual HR was 70/80. Anxiety is through the roof.  I don’t like the feeling I am getting. I am cutting my dosage to one in the morning only to see how I go until I can speak with my doctor about it as you cannot stop these tablets abruptly.",Anonymous

10,Metoprolol,Atrial Fibrillation,3.0,,"September 28, 2019",56,"My father (age 93) was prescribed metoprolol after getting a pacemaker due to fainting episodes. He discontinued lisinopril six months ago. His blood pressure was never high and was always on the low side.    A couple of years ago, his walking strength and balance started to decline, with a quick decline in the last three months. He also started to have short term memory problems in the last few months. His blood pressure has sometimes been 85:55 or 100:60 - rather low.    Another symptom has been needing to get up about 7 times at night, and then feeling fatigue and falling asleep during the day quite a bit. He started melatonin about a month ago to encourage normal sleep but it didn't seem to change the pattern. When he discontinued metoprolol five days ago, there was an immediate change. He has been sleeping through the night, not getting up at all - which he hasn't experienced for months. He also isn't nodding off constantly during the day.",Lyman

I had a 5 way bypass and my electrical system was screwed up during surgery.  It has done an awesome job maintaining my heart rhythm and rate, my only complaint is that I am limited to how much cardio exercise I can attempt as the med won't let my heart rate match my need at the time.  I still manage to lift weights 5 days a week and am very active on weekends.

13,Metoprolol,Atrial Fibrillation,7.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"July 13, 2019",58,"I had two incidents of a-fib one year apart---almost to the day. After the first incident, doctor put me on eliquis and metoprolol and after a month of no a-fib incident, took me off and chalked it all up to unexplained incident of elevated heart rate. The second time, however, meant going on these two again---25 mg of metoprolol once a day--- for good. I can understand the eliquis requirement, but am just not sure of metoprolol. While I am not putting on a lot of weight, as an athletic 59 year old, I know I am not losing anything either, and certainly feel my metabolism has been slowed.Point is, a-fib is said to be an affliction many have and one that oftentimes has no explanation.

It felt like my heart was stopping altogether. I'm a fit 27 year old with low BP and resting heart rate. Because of this, I have to question the doctor's judgement in prescribing this medication.

I get very anxious at times without this and my blood pressure and heart rate will race with the chance it could convert to AF. Lately however, my heart rate has fallen to low 40's taking only 10 mg and my doctor has taken me off it completely. I feel very shaky now. My hands visibly tremble and I notice I get more of an adrenaline rush when under pressure or fear. I need something to replace this because I don't want to experience AF again and I need something to calm me down. Any suggestions would be appreciated.",Mike.s0305

I had one episode two years ago, went to ER and it converted with an IV of something.  Was up to 170 when I got there.  I started taking 25 milligrams of Metoprolol twice a day and a lose dose aspirin once a day.  I had another episode last September.  They gave me Fleccinide (spelling?) and it reversed on its own.  The first time, I had very stressful day, drank huge amount of coffee, and didn't sleep well the night before.  The second time, I mowed both the front and back yard and did five minutes on stationary bike.  Other than that, the metoprolol has controlled it and I try to avoid stress, sleep well, and don't mow both yards at once.  The only side effect I have is fatigue.",Qs
