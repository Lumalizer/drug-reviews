0,Flecainide,Atrial Fibrillation,10.0,Taken for 5 to 10 years,"December 31, 2021",1,"When I started having a-fib I had a heart rate of about 125 with irregular beats often. The cardiologist started me out in beta blockers, which I found depressed me a lot and took away my motivation to do things. She initially resisted the idea that beta blockers could be making me depressed. I insisted that the cardiologist allow me to try different dosages, different medications, and different classes of medications. Eventually we hit on a combination of flecainide at 150 mg twice a day as well as diltiazem once a day (100 mg). For me, the flecainide has zero side effects and has kept me from ever going into a-fib, in years. I can actually feel when it’s getting to be time to take the medicine, because it feels like my body is trying to go into a-fib. I am a huge fan of flecainide and can’t say enough good about it.",Rachel

3,Flecainide,Atrial Fibrillation,10.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"October 7, 2021",2,My doctor put me on diltiazem and warfarin three years ago for AFib. This past summer the AFib got worse and they put me in a thirty day event monitor followed by a stress the event monitor showed many episodes with heart rate of 150 plus and irregular.

4,Flecainide,Atrial Fibrillation,10.0,,"September 2, 2021",1,Tambocor (flecainide):I’ve been on flecainide for about a year and a half. For 30 years I tried all manner of other medication‘s including Toprol XL and other beta blockers in attempt to control my pre-ventricle contractions and pre-atrium contractions. The other medication’s did little to control the arrhythmias and the doctor put me on flecainide once my arrhythmias started to be trigeminy. Within a day of taking flecainide I experienced no irregular heartbeats. Flecainide has control my arrhythmias very well over the last year and a half and there are often times when I go to days that any skips. I continue to take meta-Toprol along with the flecainide. The only side effect I’ve experienced is slight fatigue.,Kevinal

At 74, electrocardiologist prescribed 100 mg of Flecainide 2 x a day. The afib stopped, but after about a year I was feeling lousy.  I was always tired, lethargic, out of breath. My legs shook going down stairs. I could barely hold a pen still to write. I gained about 7-8 pounds in a year. No matter how little I ate; developed constipation.  My PC Dr. ordered bloodwork--all normal. Called electrocardiologist  office and told them. They cut the flecainide dose in half--50 mg twice a day. The leg and hand tremors  improved in 24 hours. Shortness of breath and fatigue also improved. They said the dose was too high. The afib didn't come back either.  I lost several pounds and my constipation improved a little. 5-6 months later,  I'm feeling kind of fatigued  with some tremors but not as bad. More monitoring early on would be helpful.",Mgarv

9,Flecainide,Atrial Fibrillation,1.0,,"February 25, 2021",7,"I was given Flecainide for 5 weeks for atrial fibrillation. I wish I never took it. It didn't work, I had two more fibrillations afterwards and it had many bad side effects. Palpitations, skipped beats, way too fast heart beat, high blood pressure, dizziness, feeling lightheaded (often to the point of almost fainting), nausea, big lump in my throat, diarrhoea, bad headaches, high pitch ear ringing, involuntary muscle movements/flickering, heartburn, cold sweaty hands/feet, pins and needles in my fingers, chest squeezing, random chest pains, anxiety, insomnia. I often was at the verge of calling an ambulance. I felt terrible. Doctor first increased the amount from 50+50mg to 100+100mg and things got even worse. After a few weeks I started to decrease the dosage in reverse order. Finally I decided to stop it altogether, and in 3 days almost all side effects were gone.

10,Flecainide,Atrial Fibrillation,1.0,,"February 19, 2021",6,I started  Metoprolol and started  afib with tachycardia that lasted for hours.  Something I had never had before.  I went to the ER with so the dr bumped the Metoprolol up to 50mg a day.  Dr had me just stop the Metoprolol 2 days after just stopping I had another AFIB attack which landed me in the ICU.  A new dr at the hospital sent me home with Flecainide 100mg X2 per day.  Within  week I had been to the ER twice with severe Atrial Flutter.  New cardio advise that flecainide can cause atrial flutter and added Verapamil to level things out.  After a week it did help but I was still having flutters and afib. Yesterday I cut the Flecainide dose in half  I am still having flutters/afib but it lasts a few minutes and goes away hoping to get off completely.    Flecainide was not for me it made things worse and made me feel like garbage. I would rather go back to having the occasional AFIB that went away within 5 minutes and eat a baby aspirin daily.,Katie

I take metoprolol tartrate100 mg first--30 minutes after onset of afib, and then I take flecainide acetate 300 mg if the afib has not resolved 30 minutes after taking the metoprolol tartrate). I've had 15 afib episodes in the last 26 months.  Only one (1) of the 15 episodes resolved with metoprolol tartrate only. All the other episodes required taking the flecainide acetate to resolve the afib. I've returned to a regular heart rhythm within 2-4 hours after taking the flecainide acetate for all these afib episodes. It is very effective in restoring a normal rhythm for me, but takes several days to feel normal again. The most notable side effect for me is bradycardia (slowing my heart rate to the 40's), making even very limited exercise uncomfortable.",Tach

I still suffered the side effect, though no AFib episode even with the last small dose.I stopped taking it 5 days ago. A episode happened last night. It converted after 15 minute jogging with modest speed at 9:00 this morning. Before taking Flecainide, I could alway convert an episode to sinus rate with a run. I wonder should I restart taking the medicine? Will the side effects eventually go? My episode mostly started during sleep. Running seems more and more unpractical.Many thanks",seasong

26,Flecainide,Atrial Fibrillation,8.0,,"September 15, 2019",14,Currently taking Flecainide 75mg twice a day as I have AF I’ve been taking the med for 3 months. First it was 50mg twice a day. I didn’t take the increased dose until 2 weeks ago because of mild short lived irregularities again. My AF episodes were increasing in frequency that being the reason for this medication. My longest episodes before were  32 -  48hour stretches at its worst. I also take Metoprolol. I’m scheduled for an ablation soon. I didn’t want to rush into anything. I wonder if needing the medication increased in a short period of time could be predictive of it being less effective over a long term? I’ve read sooner rather than later for better outcomes with ablations. Difficult to know. Thanks,Cos

I am an EMT, so I know when I am in A-Fib.  The Flecainide did not help suppress the A-Fib.
