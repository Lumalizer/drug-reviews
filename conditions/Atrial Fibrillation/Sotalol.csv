0,Sotalol,Atrial Fibrillation,1.0,,"September 11, 2021",1,Sotalol  steals your life. The side affects are horrendous. These drug company's should state more about these pills that are dished out on a day to day basis as well as the doctors that prescribe them. I understand what suits one person doesn't suit the next. In black and white on the box they should state they destroy your immune system,Diane
1,Sotalol,Atrial Fibrillation,2.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"September 9, 2021",2,"Sotalol Hydrochloride AF (sotalol):Sotalol slowed my heart rate and seemed to prevent afib. Then after more than 3 years of no problems taking 40mg x 2 per day (80 total) I started getting weird anxiety attacks. Trying to stop the drug was a nightmare because it sent my fight or flight reaction into overdrive - cardiologist seemed to think that stopping the drug quickly would be fine, it wasn't. (I learned that beta blockers help prevent the activation of fight-or-flight and some people get a huge rebound effect when stopping beta blockers) - trying bisoprolol and metoprolol tartrate instead didn't help in the long run. If I could re-do my life I would have never taken a job that prevents you from sleeping from 1030pm-630am, always stick to that sleep schedule, exercise for 30 mins a day, eat a more balanced diet, and never take a beta blocker unless it was strictly necessary. I'm writing this in the hopes that it will help someone else. If you take this, it's really important that you take it at the same time each day.",mike
2,Sotalol,Atrial Fibrillation,8.0,Taken for 10 years or more,"November 28, 2020",15,I've been on 80 mg sotalol twice daily for a-fib for almost 11 years. Episodes are now rare and I pretty much notice them only by the frequent urination.I've previously experienced difficulty when getting a new batch of medication from the online pharmacy. A different brand would always require my body to adjust and I'd feel awful for a few days. For the last two years I've been with Walgreen's and the product has been mostly consistent.My primary complaints are: 1) no stamina; 2) excessive sweating; and 3) loss of sexual function (which is probably also tied to hypertension med). I would love to be off Sotalol but am pretty well reconciled to swallowing pills the rest of my life.,Tim

4,Sotalol,Atrial Fibrillation,10.0,Taken for 5 to 10 years,"April 28, 2020",17,Miracle.  After a cardioversion in hospital I kept suffering from fibrillation until I took my first Sotolol!  It worked within 30 minutes.  I have been on 80 mg twice a day for 6 years.  The pharmacy filled the prescription with the blue Sotolol pill last week )made by a different manufacturer) and it did not work!  Immediately went back to Sotolol manufactured by Apotex!  They have flagged my prescription now to only dispense Apotex brand of Sotolol.,Gayle

6,Sotalol,Atrial Fibrillation,9.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"March 11, 2019",37,"I am 51 and have had paroxysmal (intermittent Afib) for about three years. I used a calcium channel blocker for a few months. It didn't stop the episodes, just made them more comfortable to endure. I've been on Sotalol for a couple of days. No trace of Afib and the annoying Pace ( premature atrial contractions) that I suffered from. No tiredness either. I'm very happy. However, I keep thinking I should have an ablation to halt the disease progress. But I'm a bit of a sissy. I hope that doesn't bite me in the rear in the future.",Andreas
7,Sotalol,Atrial Fibrillation,4.0,Taken for 5 to 10 years,"October 28, 2018",32,"I am now 43yrs old I had my 1st episode of AFIB 01/10/10 I was admitted to the hospital for 2 days my heart went back into normal  rhythm  on its  own. On 11/18/11 I had my 2nd episode heart again went back in normal rhythm on its own with the help of Sotalol of course. I was diagnosed with aFIB. I was put on Sotalol 120mg 2X a day. After about 2 months it was dropped down to 80mg 2X a day. I haven’t had a flutter incident since 10/2011, have been in afib which has a few different meanings about 7x in 7 yrs none required a trip to the ER or doctor. I have experienced all the side affects but after 7yrs they are all gone. Recently I lost 116 pounds and my heart rate has gone from the 54 rang down to 44. I went to my cardiologist who said the meds don’t work by weight. But every other doctor I have seen said my HR is too low and my SOTALOL dose needs to be adjusted. My doctor refuses to so I have an appointment with a new cardiologist to get a 2nd opinion.",BigGuyonBlocker
8,Sotalol,Atrial Fibrillation,2.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"April 7, 2018",28,"Started Synthroid for hypothyroid, experienced Premature ventricular contractions (PVCs)  for the first time ever within 24 hours.  Already taking Metoprolol (beta blocker) for arrhythmia for three years. Endocrinologist said thyroid levels were good, do whatever Cardiologist recommended.  Cardiologist changed Metoprolol to Sotalol. Sotalol made the PVCs AND arrhythmia worse.  Sotalol is PROARRHYTHMIC in 20% of patients! Cardiologist wanted to change to more toxic drug with more side effects.  I suggested going back on Metoprolol (which had controlled arrhythmia completely for three years) and address hypothyroid medication. Naturopath prescribed medication for T3 replacement in addition to my doctors prescription of Synthroid and Metoprolol.  It completely resolved the arrhythmia AND PVC's with 24 hours! Endicrinologist said T3 medication prescribed by Naturopath had nothing to do with the resolution of the issue! I disagree, it was not a coincidence. NO PVC, NO ARRYTHMIA The Naturopath is now involved in ALL decisions regarding medical decisions.",Mullie
9,Sotalol,Atrial Fibrillation,2.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"January 5, 2018",25,"Personally, I had the worst experience with this drug.  All of the symptoms I experienced.I felt as if I was going to die.Cardiologists wouldn't listen. I was hospitialized. Until an Internist appeared in my hospital room.  He changed sotalol and a statin.One drug and Warfarin .  It did the trick.",sherrianni

Was put on bisoprolol, I did not take because of the side effects on my baby. After delivery my condition got worst. I tried bisoprolol, didn't work, had an ablation worked for about a week, then was back in ER my heart was shocked 3 times in one visit, didn't work, was injected Procadamine to bring heart back to normal. Tried sotalol after that episode, didn't work, had my second ablation, it helped. Was told had TIA during another ER visit, was put on amodionarone for 4 months which I quit as the side effects were horrible. Had 3rd ablation, Pulmonary vein Ablation, helped, was on sotalol 40mg. It helped, visited ER after walking 5K marathon. 4th PVA worked! On Sotalol :)",Sandra38
11,Sotalol,Atrial Fibrillation,,,"December 14, 2017",33,"I was diagnosed with HCOM (Hypertrophic Cardio Mypothy) about 5 yrs ago. was on metoprolol 100mg twice a day. Then I had 2 AFib episodes about 1 1/2 yrs ago. was in hospital for 2 weeks to monitor the condition. they switched me to sotalol kept increasing the dose till 120mg twice a day. Which is what I need. So been on Sotalol for the last 1 1//2 years. Have side effects all the time such as very low energy, always feel like you just been hit by a bus.. and I'm only 36 yr old male. I have to say that I have lost my self coz of the conditions and side effects of the drug. But medically and physically I'm functioning thanks to this drug.

12,Sotalol,Atrial Fibrillation,9.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"November 1, 2017",18,"Had a double coronary artery bypass graft (CABG,) in May 17 due to 3 major arteries blocked around heart. Never had any symptoms before op except shortness of breath on stair climbing. Nice steady heart rate around 56 resting and BP 130/75. I'm a 61 year old Type 1 diabetic.Since my op I have been into A&E 4 times with Tachycardia and AF and for the last 10 weeks have been in AF or Sinus with ectopics. I was prescribed Bisoprolol after my op but I felt it was not working as my heart rate was way to low. Started taking Sotalol today and after 2 tablets I can honestly say I feel much better. More regular heart beat, less thumping and less pain in my legs and feet. Hope it continues but so far a better experience",John O

14,Sotalol,Atrial Fibrillation,9.0,,"June 15, 2017",32,"Have endured a fib for about 15 years.  Several cardio versions failed to eliminate the afib.  Was put on Tikosyn about 10 years ago, 500 mg twice daily, which controlled the afib for 9 years or so and then failed to control it.  A double ablation (afib and aflutter) was performed and after about six months, the afib came back.  Next was a defibrillator/pacemaker implant.  Began to have vfib problems.  Defibrillator fired twice in a 6 month period. Was then put on  amiodarone.  There are new indications that long term use of Tikosyn or Amiodarone side effects may be vfib.  Was taken off Amiodarone after four months.  After 9 months, defibrillator fired again.  Was then put on Sotalol.  Back in normal rhythm. Too early to judge side effects",NH Paradise
15,Sotalol,Atrial Fibrillation,8.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"April 29, 2017",51,"I was diagnosed with AF about three years ago.  Step one was defib which was ineffective.  Step 2 was sotalol plus defib, which got me back in rhythm but slowed my pulse into the fourties.  I couldn't walk up a flight of stairs!  So they added a pacemaker which keeps my pulse at or above 60.   All is well now, and the advantage of this pacemaker is that it stores any episode and reports back to the doctor through a transmitter in my home as well as at my semi-annual appointment.  I am a very happy camper!  74 year old male.",Fyreman

17,Sotalol,Atrial Fibrillation,4.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"April 15, 2017",52,"I was on Sotolol for one month. While it did slow down my heart rate I was miserable the entire time. I constantly felt my heart was beating differently (this is a difficult sensation to describe). I was tired all the time, slept often during the day and rarely drove or went out even when someone else was driving. I am retired but prior to starting this medication I was active and traveled often. I did not have any afib episodes while on this medication, however, when I stopped taking sotolol I felt great/normal again and didn't have another afib episode for at least 7 months.",zookeeper70

Several failed ablations and some shock work changed nothing.  For the next 30 years just suffered with 6 to 8 severe afib events per year.  Finally got medicare and treatment.

Back then, Betapace aka Sotalol was newly approved for oral use in the US although it had been around in Europe. I have been on this medicine since then. My dosage have gone from as low as 40 mg 2x a day to as high as 120mg 2x a day throughout the years. all these years I had a few AF every now and then but as the dose was adjusted it was well controlled until last year. Most cardiologist would say I am one of the few patients they know who has been on Sotalol this long. I was told since the beginning that I have the worst case of AF not induced by any activity  and will not benefit from ablation because of numerous foci.

My EP decided on adding a pacemaker to keep my pulse at 60 or higher and I feel like I am 20 years younger.  I am very active and my AF has not returned.  The pacemaker records everything that happens to my heart and is read remotely by the EP every couple of months or so.  There has been no incidents of AF, and very few PAC's or PVC's.  Sotalol with a pacemaker has been a wonderful solution to my AF, and I would suggest people who are struggling with sotalol ask their doctor about a pacemaker to increase their pulse rate.",Fyreman235

Does not slow me down and I work out frequently and have great fitness. Tried lowering it to 60 or 80mg but then the AF came back.  First tried Atenolol but did not like the side effects, it slowed me down and affected sex life.  Sotalol slows my heart rate down to 50 beats resting, but does not slow me down in general.

He has put me on 40mg - 80mg (yes small dose) to be taken when I either have noticeable heart problems or adrenaline issues as sotalol is a beta blocker.  I only take a dose once or twice a month and it seems to work within about 30 minutes. I have no negative effects from it and it fixes both my atrial fibrillation and provides an immediate calming effect like my adrenaline levels have dropped.
