0,Pregabalin,Small Fiber Neuropathy,1,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"July 23, 2018",2,"I used Lyrica for a severe nerve compression injury. It was useless for pain control. I gained 35 pounds and I became a raving maniac. I had been sleep deprived for twelve months before taking it. I needed stat surgery. Pudendal nerve entrapment  (PNE) makes sleep impossible. PNE is not well understood. Nerves can stretch. Some branches may abut other structures and attach themselves to ligaments, fascia etc. It happened to me and no doctor knew a thing about it. Women are still being ignored.",Konagirl
1,Pregabalin,Small Fiber Neuropathy,1,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"March 10, 2018",1,"Lyrica was great at putting 50 pounds on me within 3 months and making me feel drunk but it didn't touch the pain caused by small fiber neuropathy. I just felt drunk, stupid and fat and still had debilitating aches in my feet and hands. Then it took me a year to shake off those pounds. Thanks Lyrica! Not.",Jen
