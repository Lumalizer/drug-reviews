1,Gabapentin,Small Fiber Neuropathy,1,,"October 19, 2020",8,"I was on gabapentin dose of 3600mg a day. It did nothing for my small fiber neuropathy pain. I actually got the reverse out of it as it gave me more pronounced feet and sciatica pain. I was put on opioids and taken off the gabapentin and at least the sciatic pain went away. I then moved and found a new pain doctor. He wanted me off the opioids and insisted I go back on gabapentin. I immediately started having horrible sciatica nerve pain again. It felt as though someone reached into my leg to strum a banjo chord. The nerve would verberate, leaving me rolling on the ground in agony. I stopped the gabapentin and the sciatica pain has not returned. I still suffer from the small fiber neuropathy and take hydrocodone for it.",Spur
2,Gabapentin,Small Fiber Neuropathy,10,,"September 21, 2019",10,"I have been suffering and tortured since I was 5 years old with entire body in itching, zapping and crawling sensations from head to toe simultaneously. No doc could help. After doing my own research (since the 90â€™s) I diagnosed myself and was properly DX by neuro. I somehow came across Gabapentin which until this day is the ONLY thing that resets my nerves when they flare up.",Genetic nerve malfunctioning

4,Gabapentin,Small Fiber Neuropathy,2,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"June 2, 2015",20,"Symptoms of my Small Fiber are burning,  prickling and deep pain in extremities. Gabapentin felt like it worked for the first few days. But then needed to be upped to the next dose after about 5 days.  Then the cycle continued. some relief, then needed to be upped again.  In my case i found my body built up a tolerance too quickly. Was up to 3000mg and experience no relief at all. Its very hit or miss when it comes to small fiber neuropathy.",ptrac30
