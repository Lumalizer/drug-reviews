0,Spironolactone,Hypokalemia,9,,"March 25, 2012",20,"It does help me getting back my life. I used to get paralysed because of low level of potassium in my blood. The doctor then told me to consume coconut water for a week and spironolactone 100mg per day. Now I can say I'm pretty well. My high blood pressure is under control too. I think it's great. The doctor told me not to get pregnant as he wasn't sure about the side effect to pregnancy. To me, it's OK.",fransiska
