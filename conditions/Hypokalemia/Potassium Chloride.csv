0,Potassium Chloride,Hypokalemia,8.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"March 29, 2022",0,Klor-Con (potassium chloride):I prefer the fizzy tablets to these extremely large and difficult to swallow pills. I have chronic hypokalemia and take Klor-Con 20 twice a day. It seems to work ok as once and awhile I get a normal potassium level. Usually I'm still hypokalemic tho. It's not as low as before and I've managed to stay out of the hospital since starting this. I have no side effects. The pills are so difficult to swallow!,Spotter

5,Potassium Chloride,Hypokalemia,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"September 20, 2019",41,"I started taking this 20meq medicine this week. Today, when I try to take it, I almost choked if it was not for the help of a friend who hit my back and took me from behind to help me. Is it not possible to make it smaller? Or that it has a coating that helps swallow it whole? The people who designed it tried to take it as it seems impossible to be swallowed by a human being ?. For the record, I'm an adult and I have no trouble swallowing. Please, reformulate this  pill",s
