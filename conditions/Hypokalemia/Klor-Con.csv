0,Klor-Con,Hypokalemia,8.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"March 29, 2022",0,I prefer the fizzy tablets to these extremely large and difficult to swallow pills. I have chronic hypokalemia and take Klor-Con 20 twice a day. It seems to work ok as once and awhile I get a normal potassium level. Usually I'm still hypokalemic tho. It's not as low as before and I've managed to stay out of the hospital since starting this. I have no side effects. The pills are so difficult to swallow!,Spotter

2,Klor-Con,Hypokalemia,,,"October 18, 2009",46,Works fast and well. It will put you back to normal within in 1-2 hours!,Anonymous
3,Klor-Con,Hypokalemia,9.0,,"August 6, 2009",68,"I use this to prevent muscle cramps so severe that I have thought I would tear muscles lose.  I take 2 tablets each day along with 3 x 600mg calcium citrate with Vitamin D caplets.  Sometimes I have to take an additional Klor-con 20 if I am passing a lot of urine.  I take Lasix 40 mg a day, I was taking 80 mg and I would get cramps within 6 hours of taking it.  I had been using Quinine previously, but it was taken off the market.",Sonflower
