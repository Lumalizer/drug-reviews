1,Urso,Primary Biliary Cholangitis,10,,"July 29, 2008",54,"I was dx PBC-Stage 2 Feb 08 and started URSO.  I was sent to Baylor a few weeks later and their tests indicated I had a negative AMA!  They asked me to stop taking URSO to see if weight loss alone improves the condition.  I was off URSO for 4 months and lost 25 lbs.  My AMA count is higher now than ever, so I am going back on URSO this morning.  It is very obvious to me that the URSO put my antibodies to sleep while I was on the drug.  That is why my doctor put me back on it today.",Anonymous
