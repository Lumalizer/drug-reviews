0,Hydrocortisone topical,Hemorrhoids,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"March 18, 2022",0,"Went into the ER for hemorrhoids and the doctor prescribed 25 mg Hydrocortisone Acetone suppositories. It worked pretty much immediately after inserting it. However, the pain seems to keep coming back after about 12-24 hours. I’ve only been using 1 per day for 4 days, though. But yes, they’re working. I’m worried about after I run out.",Anonymous

3,Hydrocortisone topical,Hemorrhoids,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"November 28, 2021",1,"My doctor prescribed me Hydrocortisone Suppositories 25mg, for my Hemorrhoids; after taking 1 suppository for 3 days, instead of it getting better I could no longer even get another up in me, I had swollen so much and my anus itched and I was bleeding terrible for about 5 days with light diarrhea, until I finally gave in and went to see my doctor again, which we talked, I disagreed to do the surgery, she gave me some PH Cream; Today, almost 2 weeks from my last suppository given, I pooped a lot and there was clumps of what looked like white pencil in my poop, It was un-dissolved Suppositories.  I feel so much better now and much lighter feeling after 3 bowel movements.  I will never take a suppository again.",Anonymous
4,Hydrocortisone topical,Hemorrhoids,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"May 27, 2021",8,"My hemorrhoids have became worse with hydrocortisone, and has also cause two new ones to form. My hemorrhoids never bothered me until my doctor prescribed this medication to me. Now they’re immensely swollen and burn constantly. I really don’t recommend hydrocortisone for people who have reverse side effects to commonly used medications especially if you’re not sure if you are allergic to it or not.",DoveBreath

6,Hydrocortisone topical,Hemorrhoids,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"April 13, 2020",29,"Proctosol-HC (hydrocortisone):I have hemorrhoids as I suffer constipation due to my endometriosis and I have tried all kinds of products for them. Many disappear on their own but there is one in specific that makes me desperate. My boyfriend gave me this cream and although I was skeptical, I tried it and it's magical. The second time I used it, it eased the burning and pain, on the third day all symptoms it has completely disappeared. I feel like I finally found the perfect product.",Jeannette

8,Hydrocortisone topical,Hemorrhoids,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"December 20, 2019",24,"Proctozone HC (hydrocortisone):My doctor prescribed this when I had a pretty bad hemorrhoid flare-up . It was supposed to shrink the tissue. Little did I know that this caused me extreme swelling, redness and horrible itchiness all over my genitalia after only one application on my hemorrhoids.I contacted the doctor asking if this could be an allergic reaction but she said it was likely from the sitzbaths I had been taking with Epsom salts so I continued using it for about 6 days and my symptoms got progressively worse! I will never use a steroid / hydrocortisone in my life again. After finding out about all the side effects, what good of use is this!?",Tinibini
9,Hydrocortisone topical,Hemorrhoids,7.0,,"November 17, 2019",6,Anucort-HC (hydrocortisone):These are one of the few things that helped with my internal hemorrhoids. A temporary fix until I see a GI doctor. They're not cheap.,Uncle bud
10,Hydrocortisone topical,Hemorrhoids,8.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"April 15, 2018",13,"Anusol-HC Suppositories (hydrocortisone):4 boxes of Prep H= no results. Doctor prescribed Hydrocortisone AC 25mg Suppositories. Insurance does not cover (over $200.00.) Discovered Prescription Discount Coupons. I bought 12 @ $45.18 w/coupon. Most drug stores accept the coupons. Much better relief then Prep H. Use twice a day. Have bowel movement first. I'm doing Atkins Diet, so bad constipation, which does not help the condition. Now taking Colace, which helps. No fiber supplements, since they mess up Atkins Diet. In 6 weeks, I have lost 18 lbs. Felt so good that I went to the gym, just Treadmill and Elliptical for 5 miles. Felt itchy burning during workout, so I think exercise aggravated it, but exercise is good for constipation. Just bought another box of 12.  Skipping exercise a few days this time. Stopping Atkins ''might'' help relieve the swelling, but I'm committed to losing weight. I will update if this site sends me a notification or I can find it again. Good luck. It is literally a ''pain in the buttocks.''",painedbehind
11,Hydrocortisone topical,Hemorrhoids,1.0,,"August 10, 2017",13,"Anusol-HC Suppositories (hydrocortisone):Didn't do anything for me. Tried to work its way out before it completely dissolved. On day 4 of the treatment, I could no longer deal with the increased burning, pain and itching that I experienced. Also had some change in my BMs while on these suppositories, with increased need to go, therefore increased wiping and increased irritation. Seemed to do the opposite of what is was supposed to do.",Chauffeur Lady
