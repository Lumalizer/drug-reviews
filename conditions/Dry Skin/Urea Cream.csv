0,Urea Cream,Dry Skin,,Taken for less than 1 month,"January 21, 2022",0,False advertisement. Bottle states 3oz and the bottle is half full. $70 and not even a full bottle is a rip off.  Will not be refilling my prescription with this brand,Irritated
1,Urea Cream,Dry Skin,9.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"January 3, 2021",1,A 1oz bottle is expensive! I use it on calloused heals and toes etc. see how far one ounce goes on calloused feet. Not far. And it is a cream. Imagine getting cream out of a one ounce bottle!!! Almost impossible. Needs improvement!!!,Tim
2,Urea Cream,Dry Skin,10.0,,"April 29, 2020",11,"I have had extremely dry heels for years. I tried to get rid of this dry skin on my heels by exfoliating my heels with a pumice stone as well as pedicures.  Nothing helped, until I used this prescription of Urea 40 topical.  After 1 use, my heels looked almost totally normal!  And I didn't have to do any scrubbing of my heels.  All I did was smooth the cream/gel onto my heels before I went to bed.  I awoke in the morning to nondry heels. It seems like magic. I wish I had known about this years ago!Thank you to the pharmaceutical industry for making this product!",Elisheva7
3,Urea Cream,Dry Skin,10.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"July 17, 2018",6,Carmol (urea):I used Carmol Cream 40% for dry cracked heels. It was a RX and I don't know if it is sold over the counter. This cream is amazing & will save you time and money spent during a pedicure. Wish it was readily available! No reason to be controlled under FDA rules?,Whitey
4,Urea Cream,Dry Skin,9.0,Taken for 5 to 10 years,"March 31, 2017",13,Nutraplus (urea):I have suffered from dry itchy skin most of my life until some years ago when my dermatologist recommended this urea cream. Since I started to use it the relief has been remarkable and I have been horrified to find that the manufacturers no longer supply the cream and have replaced it with a sticky lotion.  Their reason for this is hard to understand as the cream was much easier to apply and I now am looking for a replacement cream.,Anonymous

10,Urea Cream,Dry Skin,9.0,,"June 26, 2009",12,"Kerol Redi-Cloths (urea):The Redi Cloths worked on toe callouses that were resistant to other medications. I would have rated them a ""10"" except that twice they arrived at the pharmacy in bulging packets and the urea side was dry. The pharmacist accepted my return and replaced them. I suspect the problem is due to improper temperature control in transit - perhaps by the distributor.",Renee99
