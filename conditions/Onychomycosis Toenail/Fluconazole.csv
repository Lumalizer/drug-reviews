2,Fluconazole,Onychomycosis Toenail,7.0,,"April 29, 2020",16,"I just started taking a medication called Afumix. I was prescribed this medication after seeing a Dermatologist in GDL MX, he sent me to have a culture done. They scrapped the nail to identify the type of fungal infection, I’ve had it for over 30 years, battling athletes foot as well. I’ve suffered with this for soo many years, unsightly toe nails and itchy feet. Started this medication 4 days ago and will now take 6 days off then back on 4 days On 6 days off... I will continue this cycle until I’m done with 16 pills. By the way I bought this medication in Mexico for just under $100. 4 boxes with 4 pills in each box. I already have noticed that the skin on my feet feels smoother and absolutely no itchy ness between my toes. It appears to be clearing the skin peeling. I will continue to update the results after I’m done with the dose. FYI I’ve tried the Lamisil/terbifine pills and cream both never worked for me .",30yrs toenail fungal infection
3,Fluconazole,Onychomycosis Toenail,10.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"February 18, 2020",35,"I had unsightly toenail fungus for many, many years. I didn't want to take lamisil because of the liver side effects. My dermatologist suggested fluconazole. I took 150mg per week. What a drug...my toenail fungus disappeared completely after around 9 months. It didn't work on one toenail but after another round of fluconazole, that toenail healed, as well. I highly recommend fluconazole but, of course, make sure you consult with your doctor or dermatologist first.",StannAugmon92

6,Fluconazole,Onychomycosis Toenail,8.0,,"April 21, 2016",21,"I took a 6-month course of fluconazole beginning in the Fall of 2013 for a moderate, but long-term case of toenail fungus (both big toes). One nail is now clear and has reattached. The other is now worse and I just completed another 6-month course. Am hoping for resolution. I'm also using Penlac on it. Lamisil (oral) made me feel awful, or I would have used it instead.",radseg
7,Fluconazole,Onychomycosis Toenail,10.0,,"April 9, 2016",40,"While in Costa Rica an ichy skin condition that was developing for some time and which I did not know was fungus got worse. Went into a pharmacy and was recommended fluconizole. Within an hour the itchiness started to subside. By the next day there was visible improvement. By the end of the first week chronic Athlete's foot was mostly healed, as was jock itch. Got back to the states saw my doc, told him I wanted to continue with it to treat the nail fungus. He suggested a different drug. After a month I stopped seeing improvement. Switched back to fluconizole. 8 years later I have never gotten athletes foot again and I had it most of my life between two particular toes. It is as if I am permanently inoculated against fungus.",Esteve
