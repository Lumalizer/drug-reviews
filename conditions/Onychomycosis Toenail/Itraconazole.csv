0,Itraconazole,Onychomycosis Toenail,10.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"April 26, 2021",2,"Sporanox (itraconazole):Tried diflucan and terbinafine which ended up with me with  vomiting and diarrhea and no success. Sporanox is a lifesaver. No side effects at all, feels like I'm eating a candy. I'm at 2 month treatment and I have to keep going cause I had some relapse but right know it seems its going away once for all! Let us hope!",Kolin87

2,Itraconazole,Onychomycosis Toenail,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"July 23, 2020",13,"Sporanox (itraconazole):I was prescribed sporanox to take as a pulse therapy for a toenail fungal infection. Day 1, was ok. Woke up at night thirsty and with a feeling of sand in my mouth. Day two, small cough and breathing not 100%. Day 3, the worst nightmare of my life. Let me just say, I'm a healthy young person, running around 80/miles a month in addition to regular gym sessions. My resting HR is 45. Never in my life have I had even a headache. That day, I was extremely tired, coughing, the strongest headache in my life, constantly thirsty, literally thought the next stage was dying.It's day 5 (I stopped on day 3) and I still feel a headache and the lymph nodes behind my ears hurt very much for the second day in a row. I can't move my head too much without hurting.If you're thinking of taking this for fungal infection in toes or fingers, consider a different therapy like laser options.It was too short of a therapy to see any effects, so I can't say if it would be effective, the side effects were too much.",Anonymous
3,Itraconazole,Onychomycosis Toenail,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"November 19, 2019",15,"I was prescribed this medication and I reacted badly to it. I took one dosage and shortly after my legs began to feel numb and tingly, and I was having troubles breathing. It was too strong of a medication for me.",Anonymous
4,Itraconazole,Onychomycosis Toenail,10.0,,"April 28, 2017",15,"Sporanox (itraconazole):Took sporanox for approximately seven months to cure complete infestation of toenail fungus (both feet/all toes). Sporanox had started to clear it all up when I ran out of the capsules. I was overseas and unable to get a refill. After stopping the medication for a period of time, the fungus returned to its previous state. Upon my return to the U.S. I did not pursue another Rx due to concerns over liver damage. But, if your liver is healthy and you can take it for an extended period of time, Sporanox seems to be a very effective cure. Much faster than topical meds I've used since then, although like I said soon after I stopped taking Sporanox the fungal infection returned to its previous state.",MikeRrr
5,Itraconazole,Onychomycosis Toenail,10.0,,"September 19, 2009",31,"I took one course of itraconazole (pulse therapy, 400mg/day during 1 week), after being unsuccessfully treated for onychomycosis of my 5th foot nail (I had it for years). So, since terbinafine didn't help, I decided to use this one, as my doctor advised. Now I have my new nail growing healthy,so my decision is to continue the treatment with this drug.",Annette1980
6,Itraconazole,Onychomycosis Toenail,8.0,,"August 9, 2009",78,"Sporanox (itraconazole):After a year on Sporanox, my badly infected and painful toenail grew out. Odd part is having the infected toenail and other, minor, medical conditions for 30 years; Sporanox cleared up many other conditions. The doctors said not possible, however, I know there is a connection.  Heart arrhythmia, gone; non healing nose/anal fissures, gone; facial/scalp/pubic psoriasis plus mucus membrane inflammation gone for treatment duration, but back after year.  A year later, the original nails were still clear, but different nail infected with peeling, scaly, skin across 1/3 of my foot.  Strangely it didn't get worse.  Back on Sporanox. Seems to be clearing both conditions. The returning problems above also vanished when restarting Sporanox.",Anonymous
7,Itraconazole,Onychomycosis Toenail,5.0,,"June 27, 2009",44,"Sporanox (itraconazole):One small nail had 100% infection while 2-3 other toes (including big toes) were slightly affected. After one month it was clear. Sporanox was very effective. Healthy nail growth was apparent. But I stopped using the medicine because of the side effects, namely the sense of abnormal heart and mental function (not unlike the effects of pseudoephedrine) together with headaches and tiredness. I tried Lamisil for one month and the improvement continued but I suffered from nausea, tiredness and occasional headaches. Now I have just started Diflucan.",Bogeyman
8,Itraconazole,Onychomycosis Toenail,,,"April 23, 2009",12,This is perhaps one of the best medications out there. It will kill the fungus as long as you stay on top for about 6 months to a year with the medicine. To bad it's not over the counter yet.,Anonymous
