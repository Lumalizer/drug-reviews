0,Terbinafine,Onychomycosis Toenail,,Taken for less than 1 month,"March 5, 2022",0,"Hey, so I'm only 8 days into this medication (doing the 10 on, 20 off, and repeat×2). I've had ugly funky fungi toenails since my late teens (about to turn 35 soon). They are awful, but always have been to embarrassed to say anything to a doc about it. Well, here recently I've been trying to better me, inside and out. Plus, I miss having my feet rubbed and going barefoot without having to worry about my toenails. So far, the only side effects I've really had have been stomach cramping on the first day, I'm much more tired than usual, my upper back seems to ache (but I work in a factory so it could be unrelated), I've noticed I've gained a little weight, but not noticeable to anyone but me, and normally I have weird dreams, but this past week have been super strange (even for me)",Anonymous
1,Terbinafine,Onychomycosis Toenail,2.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"January 15, 2022",0,"Took this for 4.5 months (250mg/day) for toe nail fungus. First 3 months nails were getting better and I had no side effects, but after that increasing anxiety and sleep problems. Finally realized that worst anxiety attacks were always 1-3 hours after taking terbinafine. At this point anxiety was really bad and I slept 1-4 hours/night with sleeping pills. Thanks to this forum, I learned that other were also facing same side effects. Stopped terbinafine (was supposed to eat 6 months) and my head started to work again. Anxiety was better already after 2 days and sleeping recovered after 2 weeks. Now 2 months since I stopped and I am almost back to normal (some problems still exists).Toe nails improved a lot, but it was definitely not worth it.Also lost 10 kg weight during this, that was positive.",joe441
2,Terbinafine,Onychomycosis Toenail,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"January 9, 2022",1,"My boyfriend took this medication for a toenail fungus. After six weeks of taking it, he became manically depressed. His mood swings stayed mostly in the lows. He had thoughts that were negative all the time. He had extreme negative behavior changes. It caused him to become a different person. He was cold, numb, and closed off. After being off the medication 3 to 4 weeks, he slowly began to get back to his former self. However, he still struggles with his mind constantly having negative thoughts and some depression. He is still not quite himself. This drug  is toxic.",Depression

Everything tasted bitter, and even when not eating a persistent bitter taste in my mouth.   The doctor told me to get off the medication immediately, which, of course, I did.    Had no clue this was a side effect -- was mostly worried about liver function side effects.     I am starting to get some of my taste back after 7 weeks off the medication!!!   And my doctor said to give it several more months before it resolves.    I am so depressed.    Don't even get me started that I read on the Internet it might NEVER return.     Hopefully, since I am starting to taste, it will return.    DO NOT TAKE THIS MEDICATION.    Not worth the risk.",toopwa

I had altered sense of taste and no appetite, leading to major weight loss. 6 months after coming off of it, I am still struggling to put the weight back on (leaving me 20 lbs underweight).

6,Terbinafine,Onychomycosis Toenail,7.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"October 19, 2021",0,I’ve suffered from embarrassing toe nail fungus on 4 of my toes since my late teens. I didn’t get help for years out of shame and it got SO bad that I finally went to my Dr. She put me on a 12 week course of taking terbinafine daily and after a few days I noticed a lot of stomach upset that lasted the entirety of the twelve weeks without ever getting more tolerable as well as weight gain and stomach bloating that was constant. After the 12 weeks was up I noticed a bit of healthy nail growing up from the nail bed of my big toe nail (which had the worst fungus). It’s now been about 2 months since I stopped the medication and my big toe nail has grown in almost completely normally! My other 3 nails are still infected however and don’t show signs of clearing up. Overall I would recommend this if you can tolerate the side effects but I will not be doing another course because of the uncomfortable bloating and weight gain.,A.J

I have lost 6 kgs due to nausea, it is relentless. I can eat hardly anything, corn chips is ok, cornflakes ... etc carbohydrates taste like something rotten. I have diarrhea, I try to rehydrate as much as I can but ended up in emergency. I fainted mostly due to dehydration and loss of potassium. I drink a gatorade a day to try and not go back to hospital.

8,Terbinafine,Onychomycosis Toenail,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"October 10, 2021",0,"I was on this medication in 2014 and stopped after 3 months, with severe stomach problems and diarrhoea.  Advised the Dr of these issues this time around, but he still prescribed me Terbinafine 250mg tablets.I took them for approx 10 days and had severe itching in my urethra, that made me think I had an STD.  Arranged to visit a clinic, but by day 16 I broke out in a serious rash on my lower back. By day 19, this rash had rapidly spread over most of my body.  Anti histamines totally useless and the itching is driving me mad.  Have stopped it for 6 days, but the rash continues to spread and there is no improvement with the rash.  Different types of rash and legions too.  Also felt chronically tired too.  No liver tests or blood tests carried out by Dr.May have to see a dermatologist.  This might be a great medicine, but if you experience side effects like mine, you'll wish you had never heard of Terbinafine.  The side effects are severe and not worth it.",Sean4one
9,Terbinafine,Onychomycosis Toenail,3.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"September 30, 2021",1,"This medication definitely helped my toenail fungus, however the side-effects were no joke. In the first few weeks, I had mild GI side effects, like heartburn and bloating, but by week 4-6, I was undoubtedly suffering from all sorts of odd mental effects. I felt very 'detatched', I had a very high level of 'edginess' and anxiety, and cried and got downright depressed on and off throughout the day much more easily. I had brain fog and trouble concentrating, and I had legitimate short-term memory issues, something I have NEVER experienced before in my life. I would go to the grocery store, or go to the gym, and later that day I would truly forget if I went. On at least one occasion, when I was driving, I, at least temporarily (a few moments) completely forgot where I was going. It was not severe, it was not debilitating. But no doubt, it was terrifying. I, in fact, did not even make the connection to the terbinafine until stopping it. Within a few days, I immediately felt better.",FloridaMan

I’ve been suffering with my toes for over 10 years and this is so exciting to watch I can’t wait to finally be able to feel happy with the nails.

12,Terbinafine,Onychomycosis Toenail,10.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"August 24, 2021",5,"Total miracle, having suffered from toenail fungus for what seems like forever. Did not really have a lot of side-effects, mild GI upset the first few days then it seemed to go away. I did notice that odd 'slightly salty' taste to everything that some people mention, though it seemed to go away after a few weeks. In terms of the fungus, it cleared it up completely, but the first month or so I didn't see much improvement. It wasn't until maybe month 2 where it became obvious they were all coming in clear. I think it should be mentioned that terbinafine can interfere with some medications and drugs. You probably shouldn't drink alcohol on this, and surprisingly, the drug info sheet says not to drink caffeine, either. This is because terbinafine is apparently a pretty strong CYP2D6 enzyme inhibitor, and this is an enzyme that breaks down things like caffeine. It also breaks down other stuff like SSRI anti-depressants, beta blockers, amphetamines, etc.",Stephanie H

I had absolutely no side effects and saw it starting to work within 6 weeks!

The only side effect is a bit of an upset stomach. Terbinafine WORKS! It is unbelievable miracle! Most of patients having this problem for years, so you don't mind waiting for a couple of months to see if it worked, as soon as your liver test result is good with no major side effects. First 3 to 4 weeks I couldn't see any new toe nails growing, as mine was severely infected from nail beds, but I noticed that the fungus on top of the toe nails has stopped growing. 5 to 6 weeks you can see clear and thin toe nails growing a little bit at the bottom. By today, 95% of toe nails turned healthy and the color of toe nails is completely clear. 5% of the old toe nails on the top still need to grow out gradually.",Sally W

I started at the beginning of March 2021 and it is now Mid June. There is no sign of fungus, and my large toe, which was the worst, is about 3/4 grown, white in color and pretty.

Had a liver function test before and was normal started Lamisil tablets. I have to admit I was scared after researching all the possible side effects etc. The only side effects I had was vivid dreams for 3 months but it didn’t stop me sleeping.

I tried seeking medical help but was turned away twice. Within 6 months the infection got so bad that my entire nail fell off which was fairly traumatising. I insisted on an appointment with my GP who asked me to send photos and later toenail clippings for testing in a lab to check it was actually fungal. Surprise surprise, the results came back positive and after a blood test I was started on a course within a few weeks of my appointment.

Cut to today; I haven't had any negative side effects after 9 weeks of treatment. I do feel a little jittery when I drink coffee, so I stopped drinking it. But that's it! Not bad, friends.

He recommended a type of therapy called Stimulus Control. After about 3 weeks trying it, I made a little progress. This medicine can stay in your system for 12 weeks, it's awful. The trauma it causes to your nervous system is going to take a long time to heal. It will probably be another 4 months before my sleep truly becomes normal.

I started to scratch it with the other foot it got so itchy that I rubbed it on the edge of my mattress causing it to blister the next day. About a week later it still continued to produce blisters in a cluster on both feet with the first two toes I went to the doctor who prescribed terbinafine hydrochloride,  got my blood checked everything was good to go. I also had cracking between my toes so the terbinafine and the over the counter creams should have cleared it up.

I am combining it with Biotin, which accelerates nail (and hair) growth, so I can detect sooner if terbinafine has any effects on the remaining 2 Onychomycosis affected toenails.

I also take milk thistle for liver support. Don’t drink alcohol! It makes your stomach hurt coffee makes you have anxiety (it increases the levels of caffeine in your body!!). I can tell a huge different but this is where I gave up after the 6 weeks last year. Take the full 3 months. I’m going to throw out all old shoes and all my socks near the end.  Be patient. It’s taken me over a year to finally see results from my first dose. Also after shower blow dry your toes.. sounds silly but this helps also. Wash ur shoes with bleach. One thing I dealt with was anxiety attacks. If you can push through the rough stages of this medication (if you have any) it’ll be okay and worth it in the end! Don’t stress it’s what I did.

My doctor said at my follow-up: when Terbinafine is used for scalp ringworm or athlete's foot that has not responded to topical treatments, it should start resolving within a few weeks. Even though I haven't experienced any side effects, it hasn't done much for me. I'll continue to take it for a few more months & see if that improves anything.

At refill time, the pharmacy changed to a different Terbinafine provider and told me not to be surprised by the difference in the appearance of the pills. After a week, I developed a rash on my upper body accompanied by fevers & chills. My doctor ordered me to discontinue the Terbinafine pills and the symptoms ended.

Repeat often with new file 3) Keep them trimmed as short as you can.  Clean clippers with alcohol between uses. 4) Use a secondary treatment for nail surface. I tried a liquid that you brush on, cream, or use coconut oil/tea tree mixture 2x day.  5) Soak feet 2x month in vinegar/listerine to remove dead skin & kill fungus.  Using this method, my nails have no sign of fungus 1 year later.  No more pain or itch.  I continue the coconut/tea tree daily and soaks 2x month.",Pretty feet

I was very skeptical about Lamisil before starting because of all the negative reviews that saturate the internet. My nails are improving and even though the bad nails are far from grown out I can tell a visible difference in nail color, texture and the health of my nail bed. I tease and say that it's a miracle drug, since starting Lamisil I've lost 13 pounds and I swear the medication has even helped with my allergies. I am a long time allergy sufferer and I have not had even the slightest onset of a drippy nose or watery eye this spring. I cannot say enough about how pleased I am with this product.",Anonymous

Other than that toes look great after just three months. I spent 35 years treating it myself with no significant results. By summer the wife wants me to wear sandals, something I haven't done since I was 17. Big toes are about 75% back others are about 90%. Looking forward to barefoot beach walks.",bootsonthground

I took one prescription, 30 tabs and within six months the condiion had cleared up and new nails have grown. For the first time in years I can wear sandals! I don't recall any profound side effects and I notoriously have a low tolerance to prescription meds. I would definitely endorse this medication.",Anonymous

I took it for three months and had 2 liver panels done during that time. I was dizzy and mildly nauseated the first few days and had diarreah. It has taken 10 months for the new nails to grow out but I can bare my toes once again! It also CURES athlete's feet. Now my feet are baby smooth and free of dryness and cracks. I would highly recommend this product. Don't wait! This is the best my feet have looked in years. Trust me, IT WORKS! :)",Tobysmom1111

My life is changed, since in adolescence and even until today, I have hidden my toes and suffered ridicule and embarrassing questions. Been taking the drug for 4 mths as I write this.  It's a miracle. Big toenails have cleared beautifully to 50% and all other 8 nails are at 90% or better. Taste impacted minimally(temporary). Liver function normal. Just do it.",AAT

I took my prescribed cycle of lamisil and waited...and waited...and finally after 4 months I started seeing PERFECT toenails. I can wear open toed shoes again. You have to give it time to work. Some people may see results sooner than mine or up to a year. I am so glad my doctor prescribed this medicine.,Anonymous

I am depressed, sick, weak all the time and mad as hell I ever took it and my toenails still look bad.",USELESS
