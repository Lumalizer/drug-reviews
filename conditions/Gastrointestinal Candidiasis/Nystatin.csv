0,Nystatin,Gastrointestinal Candidiasis,5,Taken for less than 1 month,"August 15, 2021",3,"I am on liquid Nystatin every 8 hours.  I started Friday night. By 5pm the next day ( SATURDAY)my temp had increased to 103.1. I also had intestinal pain, cold extremities, chills/shakey,  intense body aches that hurt so bad that I can't pick things up with my hands. Was able to get it down with several doses of Tylenol over the night. Now Sunday woke up no fever felt drained but kinda ok.Then 11 am it started again all symptoms and fever rising. I took Tylenol and it is less help then yesterday. I only took half a nystatin dose today. I am drinking so much water, broth that I pee clear. Is all this normal or do I go to the ER????.",feel like shit
