0,Brimonidine,Intraocular Hypertension,8,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"April 23, 2021",0,I been using this drops about 3 years ago and didn't experience a fatal adverse reactions as many people experienced. But all drugs are making of chemicals so any drugs can't be perfect without any of the adverse reactions.  I know is very difficult choose the better without the adverse reactions for each person because everybody are different and that's why drugs doesn't cause the same reaction in everybody.,Tory
