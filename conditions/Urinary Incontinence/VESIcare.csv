1,VESIcare,Urinary Incontinence,10.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"April 7, 2021",4,"I have been using Vasicare 10mg for more than 3 years. They helped me a lot, I live with them without worries. Before that I tried various pills and none of them helped me like these. I don't have any side effects.

2,VESIcare,Urinary Incontinence,2.0,,"December 31, 2020",1,"This drug VESIcare gave me uncontrollable diarrhea. It really affected my quality of life. I couldn’t walk my dogs without suddenly feeling like I needed to use the bathroom. Same with grocery shopping. It’s like the more I walked, the more I needed to use the bathroom. I did not find this drug at being very effective with urinary incontinence either.",Evelette
3,VESIcare,Urinary Incontinence,1.0,,"August 9, 2020",20,"Just started taking Vesicare for Light Incontinence and it does not help.  Have urges to pee all night, and cannot get to sleep at all. I start to rest really well and then before I get to sleep I have to pee again. I cut back on liquids at night, but vesicare is making all symptoms worse. I cannot do this one more night.  This will be last night I take it.  Its 1:20 in the morning and not being able to sleep again. I will just have to stop it as I need rest.",Susie

6,VESIcare,Urinary Incontinence,9.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"October 13, 2019",54,Just want to add my experience into the mix. I started having leakage when I sneezed and that sort and then the urge incontinence where I would pee myself before I could make it to the bathroom. ALL that changed with Vesicare. It is a miracle. Dry underwear !! YAY ! The only downfall is that my vision is SO blurry. I am using eye drops like crazy and my eye doctor says he does not think its the Vesicare but what else ?? SO I am going off Vesicare for awhile and see if my vision improves. Will update.,MA
7,VESIcare,Urinary Incontinence,8.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"February 12, 2019",25,"I was put on Vesicare after experiencing urinary incontinence while running. To the point that I could not hold it in before I got home. I also loss my urine during sex and was starting to have to rush to the bathroom within 2 minutes of feeling the need to go. Vesicare worked great! I go half as often, can wait up to 45 minutes before finding a toilet and can run home free! However, the side effects are horrible. Feeling bloated, constipated and feeling like I drank an ocean of salt water - all the time, day and night. Nothing could relieve this. I tried everything from laxatives to curcuma to fibre and water to changing my diet. The pharmacist said that was to be expected. But it was too much for me so I quit the meds. Two days later, side effects are still in full swing but all my symptoms are back! Quite discouraging. I am a fit person, 46, no kids and sexually active. If this medication had less severe side effects I would give it a 10.",46fitnokids

9,VESIcare,Urinary Incontinence,1.0,,"May 9, 2018",28,"I want to give this a 0).  Vesicare worked amazing for first few days - my bladder felt ""strong"" and pelvic floor exercises were actually fun and easy to do (my bladder seemed to want me to do them).  However, after only a week drug stopped working, at all.  Gave it 6-7 good months trial period, put on 5-6kgs excess weight without explanation.  Product also gave me severe headaches, dry mouth and was useless.  After going off of it I lost the weight without any change to diet in about 3 months (thank Gaawwwwdddd).   Too scared to get Bladder sling, still thinking about that one.  No other options now other than to go wee wee all the way home in my Icon undies and use a pad when peeing myself really cannot be tolerated any longer.  I am in a safe/normal weight range, healthy and fit;  humiliating.",DFM
10,VESIcare,Urinary Incontinence,10.0,,"January 18, 2018",14,"After years of bladder leakage I have finally found a new lease on life thanks to vesicare. I feel like a different woman and the side effects have been minimal, dry mouth and slight dizziness....",Fifer68
11,VESIcare,Urinary Incontinence,,Taken for 5 to 10 years,"December 2, 2017",16,"I have used Vesicare for over nine years. Only recently did it become ineffective. Also, I have glaucoma, and my eye doctor said I was just fine to use it. I had no side effects, maybe a tiny bit of vision blurriness, but nothing significant and my eyes adjusted; I also attributed it to the glaucoma and cataracts which have since been removed. Within the last few months (after nine years) I have had several accidents which I attribute to stressful situations. My doctor has decided I need to try another drug (I am SO anti drugs!) that he feels will be more effective. He gave me a week's samples. I will try tomorrow.Yes, Vesicare used to be $45 a month; now, it's $135. The new drug -$140 . I am blessed to afford it. So worth it.",#1grammy

Other then that, it did help the urinary incontinence when I stand up. I did not leak  very much at all. The headaches associated with the increase blood pressure were unbearable. The dryness in my sinuses was annoying but manageable.",Peppercorns
13,VESIcare,Urinary Incontinence,2.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"February 22, 2017",43,"I took Vesicare for several months. It seemed to help some, but my vision was getting blurry, which got worse each month. Scary! I finally stopped it. My vision cleared up. Over the years I've tried: Detrol LA (rubbish), Ditropan XL (not effective), Vesicare (blurry vision), Enablex (worked for a while but still not enough control), and now I am on Toviaz 8mg. So far Toviaz is the most effective of those. It really cuts down on frequency. I only get up once in the night and can go 3-4 hrs without urinating (daytime). The incontinence is much better. My problem is my brain sees the toilet and doesn't want hold off until I can get my belt and jeans down, and my ass on the throne. My insurance won't cover it now so will switch again.",queticogirl
14,VESIcare,Urinary Incontinence,9.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"December 13, 2016",32,"I started out with 5 mg and it helped 90%.  After three months I asked for 10 mg's and I've been taking it for about 2 months but I don't think its helping as much as the 5mg was.  Odd.  I plan on asking to go back down to the 5 mg.  My side affects are stuffed up nose and dry mouth.  The side effects were not bothersome until about 2 weeks ago.  Stuffy nose is driving me nuts.  I have a humidifier running, air purifier running and took some sinus congestion medicine....not working.  Weather is getting colder here and just starting to use the heat...I think that is what did my nose in with the combination of vesicare.  Don't get me wrong...this medication is awesome.  It's such a relief.  The only time I leak now is when I cough.",WeatherednBoston
15,VESIcare,Urinary Incontinence,9.0,,"August 31, 2016",33,"Started 3 nights ago, 5 mg.  I take in the evening after dinner.  On the first morning I was constipated but no side effects since.  I notice a huge difference.  My pads are staying dry. I smoke and when I cough is the only time I leak now. My insurance covers it and my co-pay is only $3.65.  I can't wait to see if this works long term.  I'm lucky to have no side affects as I seem to be allergic to everything.  My metabolism seems to be slower than most people so I think the 5 mg's is enough for me.  I worry about weight gain because I'm already considered obese.  Before I started taking it I would leak for no reason at all.  I would have to use 4 or 5 pads a day. Nights were horrible would wake up soaked.  Not any more.",Weathered 1
16,VESIcare,Urinary Incontinence,8.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"January 4, 2016",42,"I started taking 5mg 2 months ago and by the 2nd night I had my first dry night in months and even on the first night it was significantly better.  It has completely changed my life.   Unfortunately in this last week I have had 2 episodes of incontinence and have become concerned that I might need to increase the dose.  Initially I had dry eyes, blurred vision, headache with some nausea but this settled.  I am left with blurred vision sometimes.  I willingly put up with the side effects as the alternative is untenable.",drynightsareworthit

I am too weak to walk farther than about 20 feet without stopping--bent over and holding on to something. I cannot function this way. I The pain in my upper abdomen is awful. Also, I experienced nausea, dizziness, blurred vision, tightness around the chest and severe fatigue. I loved not having to get up at night, but the near diarrhea caused other problems.

I'd go to the bathroom about every 7 to 10 minutes for a period of about 5 hours during the day and 3 to 4 times at night and pretty much incontinent. I was miserable. Only side effects I had was dry mouth and constipation. But me only going to the bathroom every few hours, less pain, and not waking up at night was worth it to me.

21,VESIcare,Urinary Incontinence,10.0,,"October 17, 2013",114,"Wow!  My urinary incontinence started several years ago and I've been wearing pads. I decided it was time to let my doctor order me a pill.  He gave me samples of Vesicare and I have taken them for one month.  They really worked for me.  Now when I get the urge, I head for the bathroom immediately but I have not wet my pants.  I have not had the side effects that some of you have had.  I have had a ""raspy"" voice a few times but chalked it up to postnasal drip which I've always had but even that has cleared up some so maybe that's the ""dry mouth"" part of it but it's certainly is not a problem..I still have lots of saliva. It's expensive even with my insurance covering 80% but after reading other medicine reviews, I guess I'll stay with it.",Nohoch
