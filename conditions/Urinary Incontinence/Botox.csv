0,Botox,Urinary Incontinence,2.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"March 22, 2022",2,"I was visiting the toilet about 20 times through the day & night so was put forward for botox injections in my bladder, I was told the was a 85% success rate & 15% of people had problems I  joked well someone has to be in the 15% i.e me. But unfortunately the joke backfired as I'm now still constantly getting the urge to pass water but can't without using a catheter which can be up to ten times a day, I'm holding on as much as I can but the urge to urinate just gets stronger,  I was told this should subside after a few weeks but I'm very doubtful it will. Before the procedure I could urinate without the catheter but since the procedure not a drop of urine without using a catheter.  I feel let down & the 85% to 15% ratio is so people will go ahead & have it done.  I would advise against having the procedure but I hope I am proven wrong.",Miserable
1,Botox,Urinary Incontinence,1.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"March 20, 2022",0,I had Botox and sling surgery. None of these treatment works on me. I have a physical job and I have to wear depends since my sling surgery.  That surgery made me leak twice more. So the urologist said ok I think you have an overactive bladder. I went for botox and it never ever fixed my problem. So 2 years later stuck with the same issue I asked my gyne doctor to have my sling remove and pelvic reconstruction. I can't sneeze laugh nor do anything physical. It is very annoying. I always worried  I smell pee or someone see I wear diapers at work. At my hospital doctors told they  can not help me. I have to drive 500 km to get fix.The other day I painted 4hrs with my husband I had to change myself 3 times  whole underwear soaked of pee. Size of a ball. The more my activity is physical the larger it comes out. Doctors can't figure why. I am pretty sure it is the sling causing it. Not overactive bladder. Briefly botox just gave me hard time to empty my bladder and never fixed my leakage issue.,Laffy
2,Botox,Urinary Incontinence,,,"September 19, 2021",4,"NEVER AGAIN..I had Botox first time under sedation, worked great for a month, but it did not last. Had double the dose second time, no sedation, omg it hurt, It has been over three weeks, ended up with a nasty UTI, and I am still have overactive bladder, and running to the bathroom as the time. So Botox was a big waste of time, also switching doctors!!!!",Anonymous
3,Botox,Urinary Incontinence,1.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"June 30, 2021",13,"I’ve had MS for 27 years. Tried everything, nothing helped. My doctor said I needed to seriously consider Botox. I read all reviews on this site and was convinced it was a no. Doc convinced me otherwise.BIG MISTAKE.3 UTI’s in 1 monthGetting up 3x/ night, every 2-3 hoursProcedure was painfulI’m now at wits end as nothing helps my neurogenic bladder",Yvonnerich
4,Botox,Urinary Incontinence,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"June 11, 2021",25,The injection of Botox was totally invasive but tolerable.The initial side effects have been terrible. I immediately had urinary retention and could not urinate without a self administered catheter every 3-4 hours round the clock. Can you imagine using a catheter before going to bed then getting up from sleep two times during the night and then right then I get up? If this goes on much longer I will loose my mind.,CraigKraft
5,Botox,Urinary Incontinence,1.0,,"April 25, 2021",17,"I had botox for my AOB. In the days after I was going every time I got up. I had a catheter and bag inserted for 5 days, which was very uncomfortable. Constantly going to bathroom sometimes more than 20 times per day. Back to the Urologist 3 times for badder scans. Doctors assistant gave me catheters to use for 2 weeks. It's now 6 plus weeks and I can't see not using them any time soon. So Botox was a bust. I had no choice but to try it.",Boots be gone
6,Botox,Urinary Incontinence,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"February 7, 2021",6,"Had 20 injections twice. Second time, worked for two weeks  then incontinence returned.  Very disappointed.  Don’t know what else to do",Anonymous
7,Botox,Urinary Incontinence,10.0,,"January 1, 2021",28,I just recently went through the Botox procedure for Over Active Bladder. This has been wonderful for me! I no longer need to worry about accidents. The procedure was done as an outpatient. I encourage anyone who is experiencing OAB to seek help.,Darcy
8,Botox,Urinary Incontinence,10.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"June 30, 2020",26,"My 1st Botox treatment for urinary incontinence has been so very successful, What a life changer!  Removing the stress of finding restrooms or wearing pads has given me freedom and peace of mind. A lovely miracle.",Bobbi
9,Botox,Urinary Incontinence,7.0,Taken for 10 years or more,"November 16, 2019",18,Been having Botox for 12 years for urinary problems. Last 3 under local anaesthetic which is much better. Went up to 300 mg for a while now back to 200mg. Lasts been 7 and 10 months. Have been told that it is unstable and wrong temperature storage and small changes can make it less effective. I now ask for antibiotics for straight after as often get an infection. Starts working after a week. Usually self cath for about 6 weeks. Then bliss until it wears off and I'm on the waiting list again. Betmiga helps until then. I still avoid caffeine and fizzy drinks as they irritate my bladder. It does make me fatigued after and my eyesight is poorer but I have obviously aged and gave no proof that it's caused by Botox. Improves my life.,Shahana
10,Botox,Urinary Incontinence,2.0,,"November 13, 2019",16,"Had  a botox  procedure done about 3 months ago for urinary issues, the injections hurt!! It seemed to help for about 2 weeks and I leak a lot worse than I did before the botox, I regret having it done but I had to give it a try as none of the meds worked either, I will not have it done again!! I guess I'll just have this problem for the rest of my life unfortunately.",Daisy
11,Botox,Urinary Incontinence,1.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"October 18, 2019",32,"I first received Botox for urinary problems  under local anesthetic in my doc’s office in Nov, 2018.  Not horribly uncomfortable.  I went to work and was experiencing UTI symptoms.  By the afternoon, however, those symptoms diminished and I felt like I could already see positive results from the Botox.  I was pad-free within a week.  Results only lasted 3-4 months.In June, 2019, l had surgery for vaginal and rectal prolapse and a mesh sling put under the neck of my bladder.  Hope was that I would not need Botox again.   Back in surgery in Oct, 2019 to administer Botox and remove mesh sling (it became exposed in my body).  This is now 2 weeks later...NO improvement with urge incontinence.  I feel I am wetting myself MORE.  Two days ago, I started Rx for UTI.  The past 3 nights have been miserable...up to pee 7-8 times, and usually wetting myself before I make it to toilet.  I’m so worried and sad about my future.",Von
12,Botox,Urinary Incontinence,10.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"March 13, 2019",11,"At first I was nervous about botox as I  already have sacral nerve stimulator, had it done in 2018  and went into retention  so now self catheterization. I'd rather be like this than having accidents. I've been accident free since 2018",Jay dee
13,Botox,Urinary Incontinence,1.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"December 19, 2018",36,"Please stay well clear of this horrible drug, the hospital never told me the risks they said you'll be fine it will help you. Botox in the bladder is pure torture regardless of needing it, the reviews speak for themselves and I wish I read all these 1 star reviews before I had the procedure done, it's ruined my life and has only been one month. I was advised it will help my condition it's made my life worse.Anyone reading this. Do not have this procedure done regardless of your condition it will torture you slowly. I can only pray that this horrible drug will wear off in time every day is a struggle. The healthcare providers haven't the slightest clue they are meant to help people not make them worse and they should of explained the 7 risks not say just sign the consent form you'll be ok. Stay well clear of Botox it will make your life hell.Mr T",Mr T
14,Botox,Urinary Incontinence,1.0,,"September 24, 2018",14,"I had Botox injection at the hospital under general anesthesia.  I am handicapped and my physician advised me that the surgery centers won't take a patient that can't walk on their own in case of fire.  (I think this is rubbish)  The first night it worked great.  Didn't have to get up, stayed dry and I was thrilled.    Hasn't worked since.  Am trying to decide if I want to give it another try.   I am so tired of having to pee all the time and waking up in the night to change my depends as I have soaked the one I'm wearing.",dog mom
15,Botox,Urinary Incontinence,,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"November 28, 2017",30,"First, let me state that all of us need to be our own advocates and educate ourselves regarding this procedure. Don't just go by what the doctor says. Read the literature, the research, and make an informed decision. I have MS, and had bladder problems (Neurogenic Bladder ) for over 20 years. I tried every single medication; nothing worked. Acupuncture didn't help. My Dr. and I discussed Botox. This was my choice:Office (local) or hospital (general) anesthetic? General. It was great. Total time under? 11 minutes.The NEXT DAY MY INCONTINENCE WAS GONE!!! No self-cath. No UTIs. No pads. Slept through the night!I had it in April.  I would have had 2nd injection, but have had a bad cold and chest infection. Wearing off slowly, but need next one. Love it!",Kat Meow
16,Botox,Urinary Incontinence,,,"October 2, 2017",3,"Originally I went to get botox for facial wrinkles on forehead, and at the time before injections, I noticed that  I was going to the bathroom urinating more than usual. After three days with the botox injected to my forehead (25 units); I didn't have to run to the bathroom to urinate. This has been very good for me. I have been getting injections to face about every 5 months for the last 4 years.",Amatasa
17,Botox,Urinary Incontinence,10.0,,"December 25, 2016",26,"I have had multiple sclerosis for 25 year, for the last 10 years I have had Botox injections in my bladder. I don't have anything for pain as l don't find it painful. It takes about a week to ten days for the Botox to kick in. I do have to use a catheter 4 times a day which I do sitting towards the taps on the bidet, with a magnifying mirror strategically placed on the taps!! It works perfectly for me and you can keep everything super hygienic. I always aim the catheter into a plastic measuring jug so l can measure how much l do, 400mls is about right, 200mls I'm not drinking enough. Coffee and tea do irritate the bladder and coffee especially.I hope this is helpful to some.",Verity4075
18,Botox,Urinary Incontinence,10.0,,"August 24, 2016",12,"I am extremely happy with the Botox injections in the bladder. I have severe incontinence, overactive bladder before.  I have MS and my urologist explained I would have to self-cathe after the procedure. That's no big deal.  I cam wear real underwear again! Yay!",Kim418
19,Botox,Urinary Incontinence,3.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"August 4, 2016",23,"This is my second time having Botox. They gave me 100 first and that didn't help so they doubled the dose to 200. I have gotten a little control during the day but still very incontinent at nights. Still wear Depends and pads. Very disappointed. I feel lots of pain around my private when I have the urge to pee. Also I experience  a severe tingling sensation  from my shoulder down my arms to tips of my fingers and as I pee the severity lessens and stops as soon as I'm finished peeing. Apparently, my Doctor has never heard about this. Am I alone here?  Very frustrated.",Monday's child
20,Botox,Urinary Incontinence,8.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"July 27, 2016",11,"I am 38.  I have Multiple Sclerosis,   for the past five yrs I had to wear depends,  at night no matter what I did I would leak through the depends,  and all over a bed pad.  Every night.  A yr or so ago this urologist moved into my area.   She has credentials up the but.  I HATE urologist.  But my MS nurse said go at least talk to her.   We decided to try Botox.   I love it. For some reason my MS attacks my bladder more than most.  I was already self Cathing .  So having to do that after botox wasn't an issue for me.   fortunately it does work immensely for me, and we are using a very high dose.....but because of MS it only works for a little over 2 months for me.  So for about 3 weeks I'm back to incontinence,  but at day 91 I go Again!!!",Jlh78
