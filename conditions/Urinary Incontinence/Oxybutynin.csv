Decided to go back on it last year. Was only on it a short time and noticed that I would wake up with swollen eyes. Then driving home from a trip from Colorado my face and lips started to swell. I had to think what I had eaten then I remembered I had taken Oxy and figured that it was that causing my face, eyes and lips to swell. I think it does work better than a few others.  But now I can't take the chance of the reaction  I had.",MLA

I looked up the meds side effects because I started having leakage when I’m sleep. I did become a diabetic 3 years ago. However the bed wetting didn’t start until 3 months ago. I got some bed pads and always overnight pads. I now set my alarms to beep every 2 hours. It works sometimes. I’m going to request a new med from my doc or a referral to a urologist. The side affects are real . My memory is trash. I actually had a memory study. I thought I was losing my mind. Also oxy stopped the urgency but never the dribbles. I would always put some tissue in my panties. I’d use wipes to clean off after it stopped. Now this bed wetting. I’m at my ends rope. I’ve  been up since 230 am rinsing out my under wear and top sheet. Lord I need something that works. My dosage has been 10mg all this time,Tigerbgb

9,Oxybutynin,Urinary Incontinence,8.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"May 11, 2020",42,Oxytrol (oxybutynin):I have been on the Oxytrol Patch I find it a life changer.  I don’t get that urge to pee every 20 mins and when I need to go and can hold without having to make an emergency dash to the loo.  When I first started the backing was flexible and adhesive was strong.  It would easy last up to 4 days if necessary.  Lately I am finding the backing is not as flexible (crackly) and will come off in the shower.  I shower daily so instead of 2 week I seem to be using 7 a week. Not very economical.  I know the backing is different compared to what it used to be.  Unfortunately you cannot contact the company to present this review.,Bunny

The patch would only stay on for about 24 hours. I haven't had any side effects. I found a solution for the patches coming off etc. - use an alcohol wipe to clean the skin, leave the skin to dry then put the patch on, then cover it with a patch of Elastoplast Elastowrap (or similar) bigger that the actual patch (about the size of the Oxytrol packaging) - I cut mine from the roll and make sure you cut the corners to make a curve. I when my patch is due to come off I take my patch off whilst in the shower with the water spraying on the area as this reduces the redness left by the patch.

I then started taking Ditropan and got dry mouth, dry nose. I then started getting spasmodic stomach pains, nausea, occasional sickness, bloating and constipation. At its worst I had two admissions to hospital by ambulance and was put on a morphine drip. I saw my GP, I was referred to gastroenterologist and then on to a specialist.  I had a scan, MRI scan and endoscopy as the medical experts thought it was gall bladder debris. Each time I asked if it could be any of the medication I was taking. Answer : No. I was concerned that this drug could be linked with dementia. Reading up on the side effects all my symptoms I was experiencing were exactly the same as listed.

27,Oxybutynin,Urinary Incontinence,6.0,,"March 4, 2018",22,"I have severe urinary incontinence--no control whatever. Oxybutynin which worked really well. I still had to wear pads, but went from the most absorbent to the least. HOWEVER---there was a weird side effect to this drug. I tested this myself, so I know what I'm telling all of you is absolutely true. This caused my nasal passages to become horribly stuffed.....couldn't breathe through my nose at all. The method to clear my nostrils involved using saline spray, Sinex spray, hot water compresses, hot water soaks in the shower, and then, finally, forcibly flowing my nose so hard I'd almost pop a vein in my forehead. Seriously!! It was awful. Every time I'd take the stuff for about 5 days, the blockages would start. And they wouldn't increase slowly--as soon as I'd feel stuffed, they would be COMPLETELY stuffed. It took 4-5 days after stopping the drug before my nasal passages would completely clear. So, I hope there's something else I can take which does not have this side effect.",LoveLions118

I started on Oxybutynin 5 mg twice a day (oral); there was a significant improvement in bladder control. I used less pads and thinner-type pads. HOWEVER, the side effect I experienced was exceedingly annoying: my nose stayed stuffed up constantly; I'd wake up with cotton mouth; lips cracked and bleeding from not being able to breathe through my nose. It took a large application of Vicks Vaporub into my nostrils; pouring of hot water into them; holding hot washcloths on my sinuses for an hour at a time; and using inordinate amounts of saline sinus spray to finally clear my nose. When I stopped taking Oxybutynin, my nose became clear within a few days. Never again will I use Oxybutynin.",LoveLions

Day one I saw relief with the gotta go right now feeling, frequency and leakage.  The downside is the patches rarely last four days, usually 36 hours to 48 hours, which makes them very expensive.  They are itchy and cause redness where the patch is placed.  The edges collect lint from your clothes which make the patch look dirty.  They constantly get caught on your clothing and pull your skin. As they dry up, they begin to sound ""crinkly"" which could be embarrassing.  The drying up can occur as soon as 24 hours.  They are also not clear and discreet.

62,Oxybutynin,Urinary Incontinence,4.0,,"December 24, 2009",31,"I have been taking Oxybutynin for approximately two months now due to urinary incontinence and bladder pain.  It does help somewhat for the bladder spasms, but not all of the time.  I have also noticed that the skin on my face and mouth is extremely dry.  The last and worst side effect that I just noticed a couple of days ago is dry eyes and blurred vision. ",Leslie H

66,Oxybutynin,Urinary Incontinence,10.0,,"March 14, 2009",41,This has worked wonders! I can go places without worrying if I will make it to the next rest stop of store bathroom. I can do things with my daughter without having to go to the bathroom every few minutes. Still have to wear a pad for drips but I don't have to wear those pull-up like diapers anymore. HURRAY!,Emmaann

No longer do I have to worry about visiting friends overnight or going on trips and have to stop numerous times to go to the bathroom. I can finally get a good nights sleep. I have not had any side effects.,Anonymous
