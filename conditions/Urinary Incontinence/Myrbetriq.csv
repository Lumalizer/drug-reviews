2,Myrbetriq,Urinary Incontinence,9.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"February 24, 2022",0,"As an 84 year old woman I was having increasing problems with leakage, so my doctor put me on Vesicare.  The symptoms of my incontinence still got worse over several years. I would get up many times in the night and often would wet my pad before I could get to the toilet, located only 12 feet from my bed!  Sometimes the flood was so great it overflowed the pad. So my doctor started me on 25mg. Myrbetriq, at bedtime. Wow! I sleep well usually with only one trip to the toilet and I get there in plenty of time. (I do have some urgency on daytime mornings, but if I stop whatever I am doing IMMEDIATELY and head to the toilet I am able to get there with no leakage. (My doctor said I could try taking another Myrbetriq in the morning but I am reluctant to do add more medicines unless the situation becomes intolerable, altho I don't notice side effects )  We have an excellent prescription plan so the copay is tolerable for me.",Anonymous

Constant accidents throughout the day and as I grow closer to my 30th birthday I finally spoke up to my Dr who started me on the myrbetriq samples. I honestly couldn't believe they began working in such a short amount of time! After returning for a follow up we began a monthly prescription. At first I couldn't brag enough. That was until a few weeks ago. It appears my urine is dark, I am back to several accidents and leakage episodes a day and I'm physically in pain. My Dr claims a uti, so I took the prescription..which didn't help one bit. I'm at a loss and debating on quitting the medicine and switching doctors.",Blc
4,Myrbetriq,Urinary Incontinence,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"November 27, 2021",1,"I was on generic Detrol LA for years for bladder problems related to a Multiple Sclerosis.  It stopped working after many years, so my neuro increased dosage. That worked for another three years, then stopped working altogether. Before trying a new medicine, my neurologist referred me to a urologist who prescribed Myrbetriq after performing a few tests. She told me it may take some time before I saw results. I started seeing results in a few DAYS. Perhaps I am a medical outlier because the effect was immediate. I have not experienced side effects to my knowledge; Multiple Sclerosis causes many of the side effects of Myrbetriq as does other medicines I take.

During this time, I became sicker and sicker. Headaches, dizziness, muscle aches, fatigue, back pain, heart palpitations, even an emergency room visit, never once making the connection to this drug. I stopped wanting to go to the gym or wanting to leave home. I felt so bad.  I scheduled a doctors appointment assuming I probably had some horrible disease.  However, when Myrbetriq suddenly just stopped helping for the bladder issues, I researched the medicine. My word, I immediately stopped taking Myrbetriq.  Within less than a week, I saw an improvement in my overall health.  At times in the past, I would laugh at commercials with the long list of possible side effects for certain drugs.

I had been suffering with burning pain and pressure in my bladder. I was also having spasms. This has been going on for years off and on. Went to the urologist today and he prescribed this Myrbetriq 50mg to me. It hasn't had any side effects and my pressure and burning went away. It's only been one day though so I will update later. I already have hypothyroidism which makes my hair fall out so I'm kind of freaked out about the hair falling out thing. I am 62 and have had a bladder lift at age 45. Urologist said bladder looks good. He seems to think it is from my hysterectomy. I am taking estradiol 1mg. He thinks vaginal dryness is causing my frequent UTIs. We shall see.

After my cardiologist weaned me off the Flecainide, I began the Myrbetriq again; I'm disappointed to say that although it has helped, the results this time are not like they were when I initially took the drug.  I still must wear pads and am debating whether to continue taking the drug.",BB55

61,Myrbetriq,Urinary Incontinence,7.0,,"February 21, 2015",44,I see many comments about the cost. Google Myrbetric copay assistance and you can get the first script free (By The Way a 90 day works for the first script free) after that it will cover up to the first $50. You simply fill out the form and print the card then bring to your pharmacy. Unfortunately you can't use with government insurance.,helpful?

63,Myrbetriq,Urinary Incontinence,10.0,,"April 21, 2014",134,"I have had Botox three times for incontinence and found relief for about six months each time.  This medication works even better from the first pill.  I have now been taking this for a month and it has changed my life.  I was going to have the sacral nerve implant which was very frightening to me, but now I don't have to go through with it.  I am a little bit upset that my doctor did not mention this medicine to me until I asked if there were any new medicines on the market.  I have taken Detrol and Ditropan with no marked improvement. If you have an over active bladder this medication is fantastic.",Star kitten
64,Myrbetriq,Urinary Incontinence,10.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"April 10, 2014",95,"It took around 6 weeks before, I for sure could tell it improved the quality of life. It has stopped me from having a surgery I didn't want to do.  I have noticed no side effects at all.",petbiz
65,Myrbetriq,Urinary Incontinence,9.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"April 26, 2013",164,"This medicine has been life changing!  After 20 years of dealing with the dry mouth, dry skin, dry eyes, dry scalp dry nose that results from taking Ditropan, I finally can have control over my incontinence (due to Spina Bifida) and swallow my food without needing water to help. I only gave it 9 stars because of the $85 co-pay but so far it has been worth every penny. This medicine controls my bladder better than Ditropan and I have had zero side effects.",Mawyatt1
