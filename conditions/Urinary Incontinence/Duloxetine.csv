0,Duloxetine,Urinary Incontinence,10,Taken for less than 1 month,"July 9, 2021",2,I was prescribed duloxetine for my frequent urination. I was going 15+ times a day and getting up several times at night. After taking it for 4 days I noticed a huge improvement. I’ve been on it for 3 weeks now and I’m going 5-7 times a day and sleeping all through the night. This medicine has changed my life. My bladder use to control everything I did and everywhere I went. I am extremely happy with this medicine.,Anonymous
1,Duloxetine,Urinary Incontinence,1,,"September 13, 2015",11,"Cymbalta and it's generic Duloxetine for me is an evil, highly addictive and deadly poison! It is very hard to get off of. Especially when taken other dangersous drugs and even OTC ""harmless"" meds.  I am now tapering off safely and very slowly with minimal withdrawal symptoms as directed and with the life saving help. Did you know that cranberry juice and kegle exercises can help with urinary incontinence much more safely that the drugs prescribed for it?",PammiesueW
2,Duloxetine,Urinary Incontinence,9,,"November 20, 2014",19,"Took duloxetine for depression, which it helped enough, but it also worked for my nerve pain and occasional urinary incontinence.  I didn't know it was doing the latter until I started weaning myself off of it and got the stress incontinence back.  Thought it had gone away on its own.",chanf
3,Duloxetine,Urinary Incontinence,8,,"December 5, 2011",13,"Cymbalta (duloxetine):I was given Cymbalta for psoriatic arthritis and depression. It has been good for both but I developed a side effect. I asked my doctor and he said men can experience this. Urinary incontinence. With Cymbalta I noticed I went less often and also went less while going. But after going for some reason I kept going little bits over an over for almost 10 min. So Cymbalta to treat incontinence. No, But it can cause it in men.",BBaker100
4,Duloxetine,Urinary Incontinence,3,,"July 10, 2009",21,"Cymbalta (duloxetine):Not good for urinary incontinence. In fact, going to a urologist very soon to seek help/surgery options for worsening incontinence. Originally went on Cymbalta for severe anxiety/chest pains, never even knew it was prescribed for ""leaky"" folks. May work for some, but did nothing for me. Also weaning off for anxiety, due to severe weight gain while taking.",BethLen67
