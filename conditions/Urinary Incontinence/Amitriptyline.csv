0,Amitriptyline,Urinary Incontinence,7,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"September 7, 2020",1,Low dose of 20mg amitriptyline stopped my bedwetting and urge incontinence for a bit. Had to up it to 30 as it started up again after 3 months. Bedwetting hasn't happened since but urge incontinence during the day is beginning to return. Not sure how far I'll have to up the dose to get it completely under control. Also makes you more exhausted the further you up the dose.,JC
