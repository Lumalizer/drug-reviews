1,Tolterodine,Urinary Incontinence,2.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"April 9, 2021",1,Detrol LA (tolterodine):I was previously on another medication but was changed to Detrol LA due to some non-emergency side effects.  Have used Detrol LA for 2 weeks and find that my bladder always needs to empty (4-5 times a night) and a delay in getting urine stream started.  It seems to make by bladder spasm more.  Called my doctor to return to the other medication.,DoxieMom50
2,Tolterodine,Urinary Incontinence,10.0,Taken for 5 to 10 years,"September 10, 2020",5,"I have been on tolterodine for years and love it.  Before, I had lost the ""urge"" and notice and would constantly wet my goes as my bladder released fully.  Now, I get the ""urge"", but I had better hurry to the restroom.",Dollbott
3,Tolterodine,Urinary Incontinence,8.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"August 6, 2020",4,I have been in this drug for a little over a month. However I am starting to get little rashes everywhere. They are like the size of a dime. Has anyone experienced this with taking this medicine?,Msb
4,Tolterodine,Urinary Incontinence,5.0,,"July 14, 2018",21,My bladder is messed up due to radiation treatments from 1994 to treat cervical cancer.  I had no issues for about 10 years and now I have retention problems and horrible incontinence.  I’ve been taking tolterodine for over a year and for the past 3 months my incontinence is ridiculous.  I can outright wet my pants to high thigh if it’s been a couple hours since my last bathroom trip.  I get up at least 4 times in the night with soaked underwear and have to hold my crotch on the way to the bathroom.  Somehow I take it in stride.  It’s not sexy but everyone urinates.  I stopped Tolterodine today to see if that helps.  Best wishes to all my fellow incontinents.,WetPants
5,Tolterodine,Urinary Incontinence,,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"December 17, 2017",15,"I took Bethanochol for many years to combat dry mouth from other medications.  Eventually it led to an issue with incontinence, so I discontinued.  Several months passed, and the incontinence continued (apparently it becomes permanent in some cases).  My doctor prescribed Detrol/Tolteradone, but after 3 months the only change is the awful side effects-extremely dry mouth/eyes/sinus/skin, headache, increased lethargy, irritability, mental processing impaired, etc.  But barely noticeable improvement of the urgency/incontinence issue.  Also, my disability income can't sustain the copay (if it worked it might be worth going without heat or something else).  Hoping that I can discontinue without any added complications.  Very disappointing.",Val 55

9,Tolterodine,Urinary Incontinence,9.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"November 4, 2016",16,"Detrol LA (tolterodine):I started a week ago and so far so good.

11,Tolterodine,Urinary Incontinence,2.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"June 22, 2016",11,"After my insurance would no longer pay for Vesicare, which worked for me. My doctor had me try tolterodine, initially the results were just ok, but the longer I took it the more pronounced the side effects became, the con's outweighed the positives. I stopped taking it after my issues with incontinence cleared up. Due to a illness, valley fever, the incontinence has returned. The doctor had me re-start the tolterodine . Well once again the side effects returned after two weeks, a fluttering in my ear canals, extreme irritability, and finally constipation. Doctor said the generics are not all the same and that Detrol might be better, but my insurance won't pay for the name brand drug. Guess I will just have to deal with the incontinence..",Desertscape
12,Tolterodine,Urinary Incontinence,1.0,,"February 13, 2016",15,switched from Ditropan to Detrol LA recently... I am a 44 yr old female.... Ditropan made me so sleepy I could not function and did not help my symptoms at all.  Anyway but this Detrol has made every symptom I have a thousand times worse... I am waking up to urinate at least every hour at night and having to change my clothing constantly from increased incontinence and the urge to go is a lot stronger.  Not to mention the fact that I am miserable from the dehydration it also has caused.  I give up now on trying to find a medicine to help me lead a normal life.  Ijust live with my issue like I was before seeking help.,dreianya
