0,Hyoscyamine,Urinary Incontinence,9,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"February 18, 2022",0,"I take 5 or 10 mg for nighttime incontinence that started after menopause. It helps with daytime, too. It makes me a bit drowsy at night and dry mouth. I got off it for about two months, and the incontinence returned with pelvic floor pain. After 2 days back on this, it was better.",Dragon lady
