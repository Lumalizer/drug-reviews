2,Ditropan,Urinary Incontinence,,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"March 15, 2019",18,"After my prostate was removed, I had constant ""dribbling"" problems and had to wear an adult diaper.

3,Ditropan,Urinary Incontinence,4.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"February 22, 2019",71,"Was on them for almost 3 years. I had had my gall bladder removed 2 months beforehand. I then started taking Ditropan and got dry mouth, dry nose. I then started getting spasmodic stomach pains, nausea, occasional sickness, bloating and constipation. At its worst I had two admissions to hospital by ambulance and was put on a morphine drip. I saw my GP, I was referred to gastroenterologist and then on to a specialist.  I had a scan, MRI scan and endoscopy as the medical experts thought it was gall bladder debris. Each time I asked if it could be any of the medication I was taking. Answer : No. I was concerned that this drug could be linked with dementia. Reading up on the side effects all my symptoms I was experiencing were exactly the same as listed. Since coming off these tablets the symptoms have stopped and Iâ€™ve taken great pleasure in informing the medics of the cessation of these symptoms.",Dins

8,Ditropan,Urinary Incontinence,1.0,,"December 15, 2010",36,"It didn't work for my incontinence problem (which occurred after laser TURP), and I think it made it worse. It caused me to have a dry mouth, which caused me to drink more, which caused more incontinence. I told the doctor that I wasn't having bladder spasms, but he ignored what I said and said to give it a try and come back in 30 days. ",Optional
