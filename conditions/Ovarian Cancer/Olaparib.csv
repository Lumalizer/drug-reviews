0,Olaparib,Ovarian Cancer,,,"March 5, 2022",1,"Lynparza (olaparib):In 2018, I was diagnosed with advanced stage (3C) ovarian cancer. After a lengthy surgery and 6 rounds of chemotherapy my numbers looked good and it appeared that my treatment was successful.  I was started  on Lymparza a month after chemo.  I couldn’t tolerate the initial recommended dose, so I worked with my physician to get the dose down to what my body could tolerate while still being effective. Even though the drug made me feel fatigued and achey, I pushed to stay on it for  another year - past the 2 years that is recommended.  I had my first CT scan today, the first since I was originally diagnosed. The scan showed no evidence of ANY disease. My CA 125 was the lowest it’s ever been (8) since the start of all this. This is not thought to be a curable disease, but what if the fantastic surgeon, aggressive chemo and the use of this remarkable new Parp inhibitor worked? It’s been 4 years with no reoccurrence. I’m so, so grateful for having been given Lymparza.",Healthy Mom
1,Olaparib,Ovarian Cancer,9.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"September 24, 2021",0,"I was diagnosed with peritoneal cancer 15 months ago but no primary site was found. After 9 weekly chemo infusion (9 paclitaxel and 3 carboplatin); key hole surgery to remove cervix, Fallopian tubes, ovaries, uterus, some omentum and peritoneal wall and what was left of 14 tumors; another 9 weeks of chemo, I started on Olaprib. At present have been on the drug for 8 months. At 6 month check my bloods were still very good and CA125 down at 20 (was up to 319). Now at 3 monthly checks instead of monthly. In another month I will have another PET scan. I have not suffered greatly with dude effects. My bowels have settled into a pattern - a few days of diarrhoea and a few of constipation. I keep physically active with a 15-20k bike ride of a morning and 6-10k walk of an afternoon (distance depends on how I am feeling). I have gained weight but as I am 67 and eat a healthy diet I am not overly concerned.  Very happy with this outcome at present.",Jenny from Qld
2,Olaparib,Ovarian Cancer,10.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"March 28, 2021",13,"Lynparza (olaparib):My diagnosis was Primary peritoneal cancer. I had 4 chemo treatments with excellent results followed by removal of uterus and omentum and 3 more chemo rounds.  Started Lynparza about a month after last chemo and now at 20 months.  4 months to go.  Slightly low blood counts, slight nausea.  Fatigue has been sometimes debilitating, but worth it for good CA-125 and clean scans.  Looking forward to going off it.",Kady
