0,Zantac,Stomach Ulcer,,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"August 19, 2018",4,This drug probably won't work on it's own. I was taking 2 of these a day because the ER doctor prescribed it. It seemed to be working because it relieved the pain. But my poop still looked weird. When more blood came I added the prescription dose of prilosec [40 mgs/day] and  my poop was brown again. (I also added probiotics.),stomach pain
