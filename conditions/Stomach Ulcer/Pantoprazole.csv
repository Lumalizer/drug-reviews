0,Pantoprazole,Stomach Ulcer,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"March 5, 2022",1,"Protonix (pantoprazole):Prescribed this for stomach ulcer with possible bleeding. This medication has been a miracle for me since the first dose. Immediately eliminated abdominal pain from the ulcer and although I am still not able to eat much, I am able to eat solid foods again. This medication did have side effects and made me nauseous but this stopped after the first three doses which was also helped with zofran. However the side effects were minimal compared to the pain and weakness I was feeling before being prescribed this medication. I go for an endoscopy in a few days and I’m very hopeful that it has helped to heal the ulcer (not fully of course as I haven’t finished the medication yet). I hope this review helps someone!",Mimi
1,Pantoprazole,Stomach Ulcer,1.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"January 24, 2022",0,"Been taking pantoprazole since 2018 I've had nothing but bad depression, anxiety, sore stomach bone aches, weird pain on my left side all the time doctors don't know what's causing it. The chest pains, pins and needles, headaches, brain fog, blurry vision, diarrhoea, bloating, loss of appetite nausea and insomnia. I did stop taking them for about 3 weeks and felt great but that yuk acidy taste came come so I thought I'd take them again now feeling like rubbish again. Now I'll stop taking them for good",Lee
2,Pantoprazole,Stomach Ulcer,1.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"January 1, 2022",1,"I thought pantoprazole was a miracle at first.  It worked fantastic for my stomach issues.  However, I soon started having strange problems.  I had COVID previously and thought it was long COVID.   I was experiencing brain fog, unreal levels of insomnia, it felt like gallons of adrenalin was flowing through my body.  I slept less than 4 hours in 5 days.  Utter exhaustion, dizziness, headache.  Racing heart beat for no reason.  High blood pressure.  I never had high blood pressure before.  Nausea.  Weight loss.  ringing in ears that won't stop.  Panic attack.  When I was convinced I was going to die if I closed my eyes, I got off this horrible drug.  I've never had a panic attack before. I'm very slowly improving from the side effects but they are still there after a week off.   I was on pantoprazole for about 2 months, it feels like this horrible drug has ruined my life.",Panto-sufferer
3,Pantoprazole,Stomach Ulcer,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"December 2, 2021",0,I've only been on this medication for a week now but I've been having black specks in my stool due to stomach bleeding and since I’ve started taking this medication I  barely see any specks in my stool anymore.  It helps with my GERD as well besides the bleeding definitely would recommend for people with stomach/GI issues!,Jay
4,Pantoprazole,Stomach Ulcer,,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"August 20, 2021",0,"My dr prescribed Trustan 40mg after I swallowed the camera, but it was to expensive. Pantoprazole helped me a lot with my stomach ulcers. But I have to stay close to the toilet. I do not experience headaches more than usual.",ZelJanda
5,Pantoprazole,Stomach Ulcer,,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"July 17, 2021",0,"I had never had any pain or issues with my stomach and I ate and continue to eat spicy and hot foods. I was put on this medication after my doctor saw a small spot in my stomach. I started the medicine the last of February. I took it until March 7 when I had a jet ski accident which broke my femur and gave me a basilor skull fracture. I spent 8 days in the hospital, (5 in ICU), then 4 weeks in rehab. I restarted the medicine the 2nd week of April. I see my doctor again next February and there are enough refills to last until then. Last week my gynecologist told me my B-12 and iron was extremely low. I have to take 4 iron infusions and monthly B12 shots at his office. I am trying to decide if I should stop this medication before anything else happens. I have always been extremely healthy and I am sure this medication caused this. If I had no pain and was able to eat whatever I wanted with no problems why would I keep taking this drug another 7 months?",Indigo
6,Pantoprazole,Stomach Ulcer,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"April 28, 2021",5,"Be very careful with this drug, it has horrible side effects. I took it for 4 days and gradually got more and more tired to where I couldn’t hardly move when awake, yet I still couldn’t fall sleep.  First time ever feeling like this.  It made me go crazy and end up in a mental ward. After a day of not being on it I felt almost perfect and had no more issues.  I took pepcid for a couple weeks and my stomach ulcer caused from too much NSAID’s was better. My advice, stick with over the counter meds like Pepcid and watch out for the mental effects of this.",Danny
7,Pantoprazole,Stomach Ulcer,,Taken for less than 1 month,"April 9, 2021",3,"I  have peptic ulcer, and I feel some time my stomach is so bad, I can't sleep or sit in some times. Now after using 'Pantoprazole' tablet my stomach isn't like that any more, not even one time.",Hari
8,Pantoprazole,Stomach Ulcer,4.0,,"August 21, 2020",18,"I took Pantoprazole first time for a month. It gave me very bad headaches, every day. On top of that I felt very depressed. Initially I didn't connect these symptoms to Pantoprazole. But 2 days after I stopped taking it those symptoms were gone. I felt so relieved! As for ulcer, it took care of pain, but ulcer didn't heal. I assume taking Pantoprazole only is not the cure. Very particular diet and very small portions together with treatment is the right approach. But my doctor told me I could eat anything I wanted. So I did. I had to start Pantoprazole again for a month. And headaches and depression came back . Both were very bad. It took care of pain again, but didn't heal the ulcer again. I am taking it now again. Headache is coming back. Ulcer hurts more. I have to watch now what I eat. I begin to think that eating small portions and very gentle food is a better treatment than Pantoprazole.",Lica
9,Pantoprazole,Stomach Ulcer,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"July 3, 2020",107,"The doctor prescribed this drug to heal mystomach after having nausea and no appetite. After taking this drug I have experience really bad side effects which have affected me so much. Depression and extreme crying, anxiety to the point of having chest pains and tight chest feeling, joint pain, pins and needles, fever, gas and bloating, extreme nausea and no desire to eat, abdominal pain, brain fog, weakness and tired, insomnia, headaches. This has made me go to the ER thinking something serious was wrong with me. Being off of this medication for 2 days and symptoms are subsiding but still present. I was finally able to regain some appetite and eat again. I am sharing my story to let others know of the serious side effects of this medication.",Eva
10,Pantoprazole,Stomach Ulcer,9.0,,"April 4, 2020",76,"Currently taking pantoprazole 40mg twice daily for a bit over 2 months now, for treatment of a possible ulcer and as prophylaxis while on extensive anti-inflammatory medications for another condition. Works great as far as I can tell, and I can't think of any side negative effects except some very mild stomach upset within ~20 minutes to an hour after taking it. I'm unfortunately very prone to side effects from medications, so I figured I'd write this review to help reassure people who might be seeing all the negative reviews on here.",M
11,Pantoprazole,Stomach Ulcer,1.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"January 19, 2020",19,pantoprazole  was prescribed for bleeding ulcer and severe anemia. Do not have GERD or acid reflux. I have never taken a med that has caused me so much pain. First in abdomen and then spasms in neck and back. No energy and look and feel like I'm 100 years old. Everywhere I have arthritis is burning.  Most days heating pads are my best friend.  Just hope the side effects go away when I go off it. Apparently these side effects are listed on several websites. Just hope that it's healing the ulcer. Can't rate in for healing but for side effects.,Catlover
12,Pantoprazole,Stomach Ulcer,7.0,,"January 4, 2020",5,My name is Alison all my life I have dealt with ulcers never ate much but had them.

13,Pantoprazole,Stomach Ulcer,,Taken for less than 1 month,"October 18, 2019",19,"I started taking pantoprazole about 3 weeks ago. Saturday morning I my head woke me up throbbing, not being able to get out of bed like serious migraine I never experienced no pain like this in my life. Sunday and Monday I was ok dizzy but my head seemed ok. Tuesday came around and that awful headache was back it turns out 10 percent of people get migraines from this. I have to say it did help my ulcer but I definitely will never forget that headache pain. Now I have to be on muscle relaxers and anticonvulsants till this drug leaves my system to deal with the headaches - just an FYI.",Mel
14,Pantoprazole,Stomach Ulcer,3.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"October 12, 2019",8,I took pantoprazole for two days. It took away some of the symptoms but I still have issues in the bathroom. I delayed taking the dose today just to see how I was doing because for the most part I felt alright while on it. But now I realize that it is just a bandaid to mask the symptoms so that I'll just think that it is working on the stomach when really nobody knows (yet) what my problem is and that medication is not guaranteed to help me get things sorted out. I can belch and fart if I'm lucky to  get rid of the trapped gas that is there. I have gone for days without having to do anything except pee and then I get lucky after I start to hear gurgling. The pain is constant of course and it travels. Sometimes nothing relieves it. I refuse to take anything for pain management. Would I recommend this? Only if you have a proper diagnosis. Other than that nope.,c00lbeagle
15,Pantoprazole,Stomach Ulcer,8.0,,"May 12, 2019",9,"I had GERD causing a sore throat, it started after a pregnancy in which I threw up a lot. Took Zantac didn’t really help. Was also having stomach problems and so eventually a scope was done and several small stomach ulcers were found. Took this PPI Pantoprazole because I was still breastfeeding. For a while it was really helpful, (did make me flatulent though). Stopped for a while for a pregnancy, went back on after 18 months maybe had shaking leg syndrome ( twitching legs at night probably magnesium deficiency) And was having interstitial cystitis or an irritation of the bladder actually had it scoped for ( expensive procedure with camera and general anesthetic)But it was the pantaprozole . It all went away when I stopped taking it. Unfortunately my throat got so bad I started retching at the table when eating and gaining weight because I would eat continuously to keep down the pain. Anyhow went back on different PPI, and after a year my bladder is starting to bug me again.",Neededsomthing

23,Pantoprazole,Stomach Ulcer,1.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"May 26, 2016",21,"I gave it a 1 because the side effects for me were so severe.  I can't tell yet whether it helped my stomach but I knew instantly I had to get off it.  Further reading and other people's experiences sealed the deal for me.  I went deaf, instantly jaundice face and eyes, eye sight went some days...some days not.  I was taking other drugs that were compatible with it but the side effects I'm certain came from this one.  Once I went off of it (I tapered down over a week while upping my diet based on my condition's needs) I had a severe headache for a couple of days, heart raced and a bit of nausea.  Feel much better now and the jaundice is gone and after almost two months of not being able to hear, I hear a bit better today.  I was taking 80mg",Jewelgal

The Dr. gave me Protonix, and I swear after just taking the first pill that first night, the symptoms were gone! The pills were so effective, I only took them for 5 nights in a row, (even though he told me to finish the bottle) and just saved the other pills in case I might need them in the future. So far the pain has only come back once, from eating too much Tabasco sauce one night, but other than that, I've not been woken up with the pain since I've taken the pills.
