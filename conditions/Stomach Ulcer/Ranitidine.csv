1,Ranitidine,Stomach Ulcer,10.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"September 24, 2018",6,"I found this to be very good. I was put on omeprazole first but that caused really bad IBS, so my doctor changed to this one and no problems so far. I am due to come off them so will update with my progress then",Lowry
2,Ranitidine,Stomach Ulcer,,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"August 19, 2018",4,Zantac (ranitidine):This drug probably won't work on it's own. I was taking 2 of these a day because the ER doctor prescribed it. It seemed to be working because it relieved the pain. But my poop still looked weird. When more blood came I added the prescription dose of prilosec [40 mgs/day] and  my poop was brown again. (I also added probiotics.),stomach pain

5,Ranitidine,Stomach Ulcer,10.0,,"May 13, 2013",5,"I used ranitidine since 2000 and the acid stomach burns continued. I started using Equaline ranitidine tablets USP 150 around May 1, 2013 and I don't have the acid stomach burn anymore.  I don't even have to use Equaline everyday like I did the other ranitidine. Surprisingly, I think that Equaline may cure my stomach acid burns for good.",epitome7
