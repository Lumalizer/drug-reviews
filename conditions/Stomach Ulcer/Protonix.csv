0,Protonix,Stomach Ulcer,10,Taken for less than 1 month,"March 5, 2022",1,"Prescribed this for stomach ulcer with possible bleeding. This medication has been a miracle for me since the first dose. Immediately eliminated abdominal pain from the ulcer and although I am still not able to eat much, I am able to eat solid foods again. This medication did have side effects and made me nauseous but this stopped after the first three doses which was also helped with zofran. However the side effects were minimal compared to the pain and weakness I was feeling before being prescribed this medication. I go for an endoscopy in a few days and I’m very hopeful that it has helped to heal the ulcer (not fully of course as I haven’t finished the medication yet). I hope this review helps someone!",Mimi
1,Protonix,Stomach Ulcer,10,,"February 8, 2014",128,"Had the most excruciating, painful ulcers that would wake me up in the middle of the night, and be so bad that I would double over from the pain. The Dr. gave me Protonix, and I swear after just taking the first pill that first night, the symptoms were gone! The pills were so effective, I only took them for 5 nights in a row, (even though he told me to finish the bottle) and just saved the other pills in case I might need them in the future. So far the pain has only come back once, from eating too much Tabasco sauce one night, but other than that, I've not been woken up with the pain since I've taken the pills. These pills were a God send for me. Extremely effective.",Suzette1984

6,Protonix,Stomach Ulcer,8,,"May 18, 2011",67,"After a couple of days using Protonix, I felt relief in my stomach of the full feeling I would get whenever I ate.  I used to feel very bloated and uncomfortable after I ate a meal, I wasn't overeating either.  I had to watch what I ate too, such as spices, onions, etc. Most of those symptoms have gone away.",Anonymous
7,Protonix,Stomach Ulcer,10,,"December 9, 2008",74,"Using this medication reduced the bloated feeling I had. It also reduced my appetite, caused by the air pockets, before I was using this drug. Great medicine, with no side effects that I am aware of.",Cdicrisci
8,Protonix,Stomach Ulcer,10,,"April 9, 2008",99,"I was taking an acid reducer called Ranitidine quite often over  a 3 year period.  Doctor prescribed 40mg Protonix for 28 days and my stomach  felt so much better. Now going without the medication for 10 days, it feels as if my stomach is not doing so well. Doctor advised that I take 20 mg when needed. Bottom line - it worked for me.",lllkkkjjj
