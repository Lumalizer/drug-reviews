0,Sucralfate,Stomach Ulcer,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"March 14, 2022",0,"I think it’s important to share positive experiences rather than just the negative experiences on here. I took a round of prednisone for 3 days that gave me an ulcer. I was in constant pain and constant heartburn and reflux no matter what I ate (even just water). I was on 80 mg of Prilosec which wasn’t working at all. My doctor finally decided to try me on Sucralfate. I read that it can take 2 weeks for it to take full effect. It started to help a little bit almost immediately, but it took about 10 days for it to work entirely. I now have no pain. I cannot be more grateful for this drug. The only small annoyance is how you have to take it 30 minutes after Prilosec and then you can’t eat for an hour after taking the medication. I also experienced no side effects, and I am one of those people who always gets side effects from medication. I think it’s worth a try to at least see if it helps you!",Smiley827
1,Sucralfate,Stomach Ulcer,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"February 10, 2022",0,"The medication was the WORST, The first dose within an hour I felt better, However doses 2-3-4 made me feel much worse. I could not sleep and had bad insomnia and nausea, The following morning I ended up falling asleep for maybe an hour and I woke up in the most unimaginable pain I have ever felt in my life. My stomach was on fire and I felt so sick, I was shaking the pain was so bad. I took one more dose and realized it was the Carafate.  I decided to stop it after only a day, the next day I woke up and felt so nauseas and like my insides where on fire, the nausea eventually subsided by the afternoon, I was still able to eat very little. This morning was much better and way less pain. I know others have posted that it was helpful but was not for me.",Ashwal123

4,Sucralfate,Stomach Ulcer,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"August 29, 2021",1,"Went to the ER for abdominal pain, turns out it was epiploic appendigitus. I've had ulcers for a looong time, and nothing has helped. The ER dr prescribed carafate to help while I was down with the EA, and it has helped so much. It made me feel weird at first, full, guts felt swollen, not hungry, like I was on an elevator, tired...but that all went away after a week. It makes me a bit tired, but it fades after a half hour or so, and it is nice when its bedtime cause I have insomnia and it helps me sleep. I highly, HIGHLY suggest dissolving it in water before taking it, it gets to about 3 x its normal size as soon as it gets wet. I  tried to swallow it whole choked on it and it was hard to get out of my throat. It has made me lose my sense of taste now that it coats my mouth after being made into a  slurry, but oh well. It is worth it for a month to heal long standing, painful ulcers. I take 1gm 4x a day.",Cactus

For weeks and I had lost so much weight. The doctor prescribed me this to help coat the stomach & I called it my magic pill! But as soon as I stopped taking it the burning came back, so they had to keep refilling my prescription- it was just a band aid. That was a year ago & I’m having flare ups again so I started taking this occasionally to ease the burning.

7,Sucralfate,Stomach Ulcer,10.0,,"May 8, 2021",15,"I was diagnosed with an ulcer. My pain was so bad I literally could not sleep or eat. 8 trips to the ER and finally this great doctor prescribed Carafate. I take the pills. The size and quick dissolve do make it intimidating to take and the four a day is hard to manage sometimes, however, it stopped my pain.  I hope to get off it after my ulcer heals. So, I’m changing up my food and eating smaller meals. I also walk three miles a day and it also helps manage my reflux and anxiety. I feel it’s a great medicine. The first time I was on it I got off in a month. My pain returned, but I was also eating bad food. So with dietary changes I feel this will facilitate permanent healing. I have no side -effects.",Songpeddlar

17,Sucralfate,Stomach Ulcer,3.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"April 24, 2020",25,"Like another reviewer, this was given to me as a ""Band-aid"" to postpone a badly needed endoscopy, which was cancelled due to the Covid19 crisis.  First, this stuff is a MAJOR CHOKING HAZARD, even if pills are split.  The instant they hit moist throat tissue they stick like glue.  It is recommended that the tablets be crushed and mixed with water if you have this problem.  Second, it must be taken on an empty stomach - no food for at least an hour before and an hour after.  The problem with this is my stomach hurts the MOST when it is empty, and adding Sucralfate makes it burn even more.  If I need a lot of water to get the sticky thing down, I might belch and then my entire esophagus burns.  I count the minutes until the hour is up so I can have a glass of milk, which makes me feel better...for about 30minutes.  :(",MaryEllen Jones

After being on sucralfate for 7 days, experienced severe pain in left jaw that radiated down neck into left tear shoulder blade. Went to ER, cause for pain was determined to be possible heart attack. Was monitored for blood pressure, EKG, X-ray of chest area & blood panel taken. Pain subsided and all tests did not determine any stroke, heart problems, respiratory problems, etc. Suggested that I could have had an intense muscle spasm, but to causation was determined. I have continued with sucralfate at a lessor dosage. I am periodically experiencing joint/muscle pain, but the ulcer pain is unbearable without this medication.",sam

I take Tylenol/Advil round the clock for pain. I would say about day 3 I started to notice a dull headache about an hour after taking. For the next 4 days the headaches seem to get worse. Also I noticed back/upper torso pain. It was like a tightness burning sensation. I was also very gassy. Burping/ Vurping (vomiting a little bit while burping) was common.

Dissolve it in about 4oz of water, don't try to swallow it whole if you can't swallow fast because it starts to fall apart very, very quickly.

It is definitely a choking hazard, especially for someone like me who can’t take pills very well. It get stuck in my throat easily, but the best way to get it down, I find, is if you take a sip of water. Hold it in your mouth and tilt your head back.

(Might just be because I have a strong stomach that I didn’t?).  And then right after that passed, I would feel extremely hungry- stomach growling and hunger pains. But still no appetite. That was very concerning to me considering I very rarely vomit for any reason. So anyway, I went to the doctor and he told me I had most of the symptoms of an ulcer and he was sure that’s what it was. He prescribed me this medication. I never had any tests or anything done to see inside my stomach or anything though. But I took it as prescribed, and the symptoms went away for a few days but then came back.

Works very well to keep it under control. I don't have any problems swallowing the pills, but I can see why some people would, as they are kind of large. You can't take sucralfate with food for an hour, but you can certainly take it with water or juice. And it's not absorbed into a person's bloodstream, only their digestive system, so that is great.

Because there's no coating, it's hard to get down. This leads to choking until it starts to dissolve. DO NOT take this while you're alone! Other than that, it works well, lol.

I take many other meds for other issues so I have to keep the meds separated from the Carafate for absorption so I wake up every 2 hours through the night also to take meds. It's making me crazy. 8 weeks til endoscopy to see if healed from THIS ulcer then probably on carafete for life at least 2x a day. I hate it.,Kathy126
53,Sucralfate,Stomach Ulcer,10.0,,"December 30, 2016",67,"Carafate (sucralfate):For roughly a month I had horrible stomach pain. I have an umbilical hernia and thought it might be a side effect of that, but after laying in bed for the better part of 2 weeks with pain I wouldn't wish on anyone, my husband demanded I go to e.r. After reviewing my CT scan, my family doctor thinks it's an ulcer, although I have not had the camera run down there yet to find out for sure. The e.r. gave me a Carafe script and I would say within a couple of days I was a new person. This drug along with Pantoprazole have all but eliminated my pain, heartburn and reflux!",Ozzy's Mom
54,Sucralfate,Stomach Ulcer,1.0,,"December 28, 2016",6,"I was given the liquid form of Carafate w/Lidocaine, in the ER yesterday since I have had horrible diarrhea (prior I had normal BM's). I went to the ER with severe upper abdomen pain that came in waves radiating to my back x5 days, not able to eat/drink anything with nausea. I could feel the weight dropping drastically. I was advised (just by speaking to me) by a Doc, that I had an Ulcer. No testing of any kind, e.g, labs, physical exam, urinalysis (as I also complained of severe low back pain that has been debilitating & getting progressively worse, which the 2 may not be related), CT's, etc. I was then given a disgusting liquid (Sucralfate, which I could barely keep down). I was then discharged, diagnosis Gastritis! !",Help_2016
55,Sucralfate,Stomach Ulcer,8.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"December 7, 2016",32,"Had Hpylori. Caused very painful ulcer in my upper abdomen. Took 40 mg of omeprazole a day as prescribed by my doc. Still had pain. Within about two days of using carafate I noticed an improvement. Here it is about my 5th week on it and I really feel it has helped me. I am still on omeprazole too. Only side effects I have noted are very occasional dizzy feeling that is short lived, occasional headaches and constipation only a about three times the last several weeks. I do eat high fiber and try to get several fruits and veggies a day as well as I have in increased my water intake. The schedule of 4x a day - 2-3 hrs after a meal and 1 HR before a meal has taken some getting used to BUT it is TOTALLY worth it. I hope to be able to stop soon.",Hpylori Recovery

I wasnt able to eat much while on it but it did stop the pain from my Ulcer.  I didn't realize it but it did make me constipated and I was really gassy which in turn caused pain but I would rather have gassy pain then the pain from the ulcer.,Shaunaj
