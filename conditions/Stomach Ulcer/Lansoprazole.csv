0,Lansoprazole,Stomach Ulcer,,Taken for less than 1 month,"February 20, 2021",3,"I did not have high stomach acid but I was vomiting blood and after 3 weeks was bedridden from this drug. Joint pains started in femur and spread to joints, broken bones, confusion, burning pain and took ages before could walk with muscle activity at all. it is well known and the facial rash was misdiagnosed as Rosacea.  I used to walk 30 miles a week. These side-effects are in the leaflet; I did not have them all. I am now looking at complementary medicine as there is no recourse from pharmaceutical companies. Pharmacologists will not blame drug but treat side-effects with more. I am getting better but until there is a test for low stomach acid, this will continue.",penelopenonstop
