0,Famotidine,Stomach Ulcer,10,Taken for 10 years or more,"September 5, 2021",2,"I also have other digestive problems like I can't burp or pass wind on my own, I produce a lot of gas, have heart burn, sour stomach, and bloating. This medicine was not the first but it works for all these and more. Better than the name brands. U I take 20 mg per day and have for over 25  years and it hasn't stopped doing the job.",Linda Lou
1,Famotidine,Stomach Ulcer,1,Taken for less than 1 month,"August 2, 2021",1,"This med really aggravated my IBS and I certainly wouldn't recommend that anyone with this condition take it. I experienced terrible bloating and severe gas pains (like IBS on steroids) and eventually diarrhea. Was told by doc to use this for a suspected large ulcer and possible herniation and ultimately it didn't help much at all with that. Can't get in to see a gastroenterologist until September, but in the meantime no way will I use this again! Also, since I have had issues with diverticulitis as well, can't chance this awful drug  again.",LMM

4,Famotidine,Stomach Ulcer,10,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"April 7, 2021",4,"Apparently many others on this thread have not had a phone dialed to 911 in one hand and screaming in nightmarish pain. This came out of nowhere at age 42, 6 months AFTER stopping smoking, now I ended up with this bad stomach pain. No previous issues EVER. Looonnggg story short, if it wasn't for Dollar General brand (specific and exact) famotidine 20mg white pill I would still be in pain. However, because of Lawyers on TV, in November of 2020 D.G. began to pull ALL of this miracle med from their shelves and I was in a panic. They slowly put it back, but its not quite the same and now I suffer. Can't work for the pain.",Famogodsend
