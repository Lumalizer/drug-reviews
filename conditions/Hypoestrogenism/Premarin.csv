0,Premarin,Hypoestrogenism,10,,"October 30, 2019",20,I suffered from endometriosis after my 1st born baby girl 1980(natural birth). Treatment from South Africa's Fertility Specialist (1983-1989) helped me through x 3 miscarriages and hopelessness. Eventually I fell pregnant; cesarean baby girl 1988 and my Son born 1989. Still suffered endometriosis.My son was 3 days old when I had hysterectomy done; left Ovaries in tact and put me on Premarin; weakest dose. Over years changed to 1.25mg which I've used the past 11yrs.  Never had side effects EXCEPT a fair shade SKIN BLEMISH on my chin.I've remained slim/trim yet I've live a healthy active lifestyle. NOW however -- I'm now 61 and no clue whether to stop using Premarin. I did for 2/3mths but had hot flushes & strong mood swings.Google info warns of Danger to health if taken longer than 10yrs. I've taken it NOW FOE NEARLY 30yrs!ANY ADVICE / must I stop ??Love to hear of anyones else experiences in a similar situationBravegirl,Bravegirl
1,Premarin,Hypoestrogenism,10,,"October 3, 2015",4,I had cancer twice and my ovaries are not producing hormones because of it. I'm now an adult and still have not started my period. I'm only on  .3 mg and it makes me eat more and my doctor says I'm growing so it's working so far.,Robinhood13
2,Premarin,Hypoestrogenism,10,,"July 7, 2013",103,I had a hysterectomy in 1980 and have been on Premerin 1.25 mg for 33 yrs and have no problems at all. I love my Premarin. I hope I can keep getting Premarin because there have been times Drs. give you hard time and I need to keep taking it. I have terrible withdrawals. So I need it. I get awful headaches and pain. ,Maggie568
3,Premarin,Hypoestrogenism,10,,"October 14, 2010",100,"I have taken .9 Premarin (natural estrogen) for 23 years (after my uterus was removed at 34 and symptoms developed), and I am just fine (unless I don't take it).  Any attempt to use any oral artificial estrogen made me very sick and the patches left red welts that lasted for months. So I have stayed with oral Premarin, and although I don't appreciate the way horses are treated in order to produce it, I am very grateful that it stops the severe sweating, hot flashes, shakiness and weakness that comes if I miss it for a day or two.  It did not prevent osteoporosis.  I do look 15  years younger than I should - possible good side effect. 23 years and no problems.",southernutahlady
