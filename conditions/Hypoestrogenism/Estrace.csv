1,Estrace,Hypoestrogenism,10,Taken for 5 to 10 years,"September 11, 2014",40,"I had a total/full Hysterctomy in Jan of 2006.  I was put on Estrace/Estradoil 1mg at the time.  Pending on the person, we are all different.  1 mg, I still had bad hot flashes, terrible or nasty temper, dizziness, feeling faint, very moody, feelings of rage. My Gyn put me up to a 2mg tablet. It worked, the rage feelings, dizziness, and most of the sweating and hot flashes eased or went away. I felt human again, and in control of my thoughts, and actions.  It feels good not to have that terrible rage.  I was at this time not receiving the right dose, it was to low.This week my gyn put me back on 1mg of Estrace, all those horrible feelings came back and quickly. My body again, was not getting enough hormone of estrogen and back on 2mg's.",Elaine00
