0,Leuprolide,Uterine Fibroids,9.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"March 24, 2022",2,"Lupron Depot (leuprolide):I wanted to share my story also for people who are considering trying this out. I had big fibroids and was scheduled for a laproscopic hysterectomy. My doc put me on Lupron for 4 months before the hysterectomy. She felt it would help me in hopefully shrinking my fibroids down to help with surgery. She wanted me to take the 3 month dose. I am very scared of side effects and really don't like taking anything. I did my research and decided I only felt comfortable taking the once a month lower dose Lupron shot. I was afraid to even try that. I was on Lupron for 4 months and I did bleed for the first month on it and then my bleeding and periods stopped after the first month. My only side effect was HOT FLASHES! But as time went by they seemed to get a little better and they calmed down some. It wasn't too bad, but definitely uncomfortable at times. Thats all though! So happy that I moved past my fear and tried it. It helped stop my periods and I was able to get the laproscopic hysterectomy done.",Mlh
1,Leuprolide,Uterine Fibroids,1.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"November 19, 2021",0,"Lupron Depot (leuprolide):Lupron did not work for me. I took this medication as a last resort prior to having surgery to try and stop further growth of my already large fibroids and stop the hemorrhage level bleeding that I was regularly experiencing. This was a injection taken once every 3 months. While taking, my bleeding continued to get heavier. I had all the side effects and none of the stated good effects. The doctors don’t tell you that this medication may not work and when I told my doctor that it’s not effective and I continued to have heavy bleeding she still wanted me to continue taking this very expensive medication. For me it wasn’t worth it. The mood swings alone made me feel awful, I had memory fog, and the hot flashes were so intense. Take with extreme caution.",Anne

I have over 20 fibroids. One that is 10 cm, I can feel touching my rib cage.... YES, my rib cage.  This will be my second fibroid surgery but this one is worse.  Has anyone had a provider say to use progestin (low dose) to help minimize the side effects?  I was told you should not use estrogen based BC with these products.  Will I need calcium/vit D for my bone health?  I am worried about hair loss.  The Anemia I have has already made my hair fall out.  I don't need any more help with that.

In November 2019, I was 50 years old and I had been bleeding for 75 days, due to uterine fibroids. My hemoglobin was down to 5.1 and I had to have blood transfusions in the hospital. So far so good, no bleeding at all, until today, when I started bleeding again the first time, since November 2019. I'm now almost 53 years old and I'm scared to death, I have to go to the doctor on Thursday.

First month of injection was still painful but the subsequent months were normal and I also ovulated well on month 4. Then after the last dose, it took just 6 weeks before my period returned. It was quite normal but with a very light right abdominal cramp. I will do scan to check if the bulky uterus has reduced because I want to conceive too.

Get a surgery, and if you get pregnant, get a C-section. This drug (6 injections) was recommended by my doctor. The only choice he gave me and he didn't tell me the lifetime side effects.  There was just the 6 months suspension of periods, (sweats, moods). In 2005 I was 32 years old, recently married, and we wanted to have children. Now, I'm 47 yrs old, we didn't have children anyway and I don't lubricate, it hurts when have sex, and my libido its gone, all this for the last 15 years, and I think for the rest of my life.",Linda

I opted for a hysterectomy and was given one shot of Lupron about 3 months prior in the hope that it would shrink the fibroids before I had surgery. I cannot say that it shrunk them (my uterus size was comparable to a 5-month pregnancy), but it did stop my periods immediately and that it made it worth it to me. The only side effect I ever experienced were extremely painful cramps a few times (once so bad I had to pull off the road because I was driving). Still worth it.",Vesta

I am in my second month of the 3 month injection and  I now have body aches, hot flashes every 15 minutes all day, as subsided to every 30 min to an hour as getting close to wearing off.  I will not know if the fibroid has shrunk until after the 3 months have passed. Not interested in sex, so not want to be touched. Very sensitive since shot and not having a taste for really anything.

I could not log in with that username so here's my update:  I got my first injection on 08/14/20.  Ultimately I am getting the 3 month 11.25MG Kit.  So I assume I will get 2 more shots.  I got the shot in my butt cheek & did not hurt or flare up. The side effects for me so far: A couple short lived hot flashes here and there.  Fatigue & my boobs are sore (like before a period and wearing a bra sucks as a result).   These effects are medium-mild & are not overwhelming. I'd say the fatigue and breast tenderness are the most bothersome.  I expect I will be adding to my list of side effects as we go on. The last thing I'll add is that my biggest fibroid is 7cm and my uterus never shrunk after I had my preemie son at 28 weeks pregnant.  So basically, I STILL look six months pregnant 6 years later.  That's why I'm on this medicine.  I need to shrink my uterus and fibroid in order to have a less invasive partial hysterectomy (leaving my ovaries).",Jenash

10,Leuprolide,Uterine Fibroids,1.0,,"March 25, 2020",20,"Lupron Depot (leuprolide):I feel the obligation to share my experience as it might help someone looking for some answers. I was prescribed this Lupron Depo  shot prior to my second fibroid surgery with the intention to shrink a large fibroid, as the 1st surgery was unsuccessful at removing the whole thing. I was bleeding significantly due to the fibroid and the only benefit of having this shot was that it did stop my bleeding completely for 3 months. Other that, I cannot ethically say anything positive about this shot. I started to have these large, painful cysts on my face that have yet to subside. It’s been 6 months since I got a 3-month dose shot and my face is still covered in cysts. Ironically, this shot also made my fibroid grew bigger. It took an additional 2 attempts to remove the fibroid. The whole point of the shot was to shrink it so only 1 more attempt would be needed. Please do your research. This shot completely messed up my hormones.",Mar

I took the shot for 6 months and then the doctor removed my fibroids located outside uterus on November 29, 2018. The doctor stated that he could not remove two fibroids in my uterine cavity and that he would keep an eye on them. As time went on I was still bleeding bad and got back on the Lupron injection in August 2019. I had another surgery on November 7, 2019 and my fibroids located in the uterine cavity shrunk. I did not get the shot in November and had a cycle November 23, 2019. It was heavy at first but it stopped after 5 days.

I do get hot flashes often.  My hair is thinning and  dry. My biggest problem is bone pain in my fingers /toes.  But that’s nothing compared to how bad I felt when I was bleeding.  I have been very moody at times over the past 10 months.  I’m supposed to schedule one more dose of the shot before my doctor will decide what to do next, hoping I can just start menopause so I don’t have to have surgery.  I also have multiple sclerosis.

Had a lot of problems recalling thoughts. I never bled since I had the shot which was weird. I thought I'd get one last major period or something. I had surgery to remove my fibroid in early September. The fibroid never shrank. Guess the jab didn't work on me.

I would wake up multiple times a night all drenched in sweat.  After effect of lupron wore out and my period re-started it was as heavy as before.  The only benefit I got was not having a period for few months (with some bleeding in between), but at a very high price (side effects and actual price).
