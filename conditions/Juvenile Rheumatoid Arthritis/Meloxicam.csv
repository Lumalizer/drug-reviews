0,Meloxicam,Juvenile Rheumatoid Arthritis,3,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"September 19, 2020",5,"I started taking meloxicam after my hip filled up with fluid, along with another medication. It seemed to help for a little  while and sometimes I would forget to take it. When I had another flare up and started to take it regularly again, I gained 6 lbs in about a week and I didn't  change my eating habits. I don't think I would recommend taking it regularly and would talk to your doctor about changing directions if that's what they instructed.",Anonymous

2,Meloxicam,Juvenile Rheumatoid Arthritis,6,,"October 3, 2016",5,"I have Juvenile Rheumatoid arthritis in my back, wrists, and knee. I take Meloxicam 15 mg and it works great... For my back and knees only. When my arthritis flares up in my wrists it's unbearable. Almost like the medicine does nothing.",jp184
