0,Sulfasalazine,Juvenile Rheumatoid Arthritis,7,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"December 11, 2016",4,"Sulfasalazine initially caused extreme headaches upon waking, extra strength acetametaphine worked for those.  It took months to begin to work and I eventually got to 4 pills per day.  It took an extra six months for it to work well.  I still have low grade inflammation but at least I am not miserable anymore, can sleep through the night and get up fairly well.  So it did work but for me it took a super long time to do so. My CRP dropped to normal (2 from 16.5) well before I felt close to normal.",Pusheen
