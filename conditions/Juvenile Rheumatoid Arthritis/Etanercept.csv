0,Etanercept,Juvenile Rheumatoid Arthritis,10.0,,"January 9, 2020",4,"Enbrel (etanercept):Enbrel is a miracle drug. I went from someone who limped when they walked, was in constant low grade pain even on MTX and plaquenil and celebrex, to someone who can run a 10k with no joint pain. RA doesn't even really play much of a role in my life anymore. I've been on Enbrel for several years now (close to 7 I think?) and I can't imagine what my life would be like without it. Also, no real side effects. Literally a wonder drug.",KC
1,Etanercept,Juvenile Rheumatoid Arthritis,9.0,,"November 13, 2017",8,"Enbrel (etanercept):My son was diagnosed with Juvenile Arthritis when he was 11 years old. He started having pain in his heels and feet and was on crutches and unable to walk. He went from super active playing basketball and football to being unable to walk and going to school on crutches and in lots of pain. After being diagnosed and starting on the injections, my son noticed immediately the flare ups stopping and being able to walk with a limp, then jog, then run and back to playing all the sports he loves. He actually looked forward to the injections because he was able to see improvement each week with the injections. In two years his only side effect is an occasionally upset stomach.",Check05
2,Etanercept,Juvenile Rheumatoid Arthritis,7.0,,"March 27, 2017",2,"Enbrel (etanercept):Make sure and take the shot on your thigh. It hurts less. Also, do not buy into the advice about icing the area or letting the shot sit out for a bit to warm up some. It hurts the same. I have been on Enbrel for five months. The big red spots do go down after a week on the first few shots and after a month you only get a mark for a day or two. My advice is to give yourself your shot on a Sunday and by the weekend you'll have no mark. I am in college and it is not that bad. I am on 50 mg which has not worked well and my doctor is going to increase my dosage. It helps some, but Celebrex is still my go-to for pain. Wash your hands a lot!",Happygoluckygirl
3,Etanercept,Juvenile Rheumatoid Arthritis,8.0,Taken for 5 to 10 years,"June 8, 2016",3,"Enbrel (etanercept):I tried other medications for RA before trying Enbrel and they either did not work for me or had side effects that I couldn't handle. Without Enbrel I would likely be disabled. That said, the cost of this medication without employer-provided insurance is completely unaffordable.The recent changes to the Enbrel Sureclick autoinjector (circa 2016, maybe 2015) are terrible. As another user mentioned below, the button on the old injector would go off easily once it was up against your skin. Now it is harder to push and harder to predict - you can go through several rounds of psyching yourself up for the injection only to have the autoinjector not go off each time. Frustrating!!",Amanda B
4,Etanercept,Juvenile Rheumatoid Arthritis,9.0,,"April 25, 2016",5,"Enbrel (etanercept):My daughter was diagnosed with rehumatoid arthritis at the age of 5. It took almost 6 months to get the right diagnosis. She was hospitalized and put on enbrel. It was amazing to see her walking again, being able to use her hands, and run. She has being using enbrel for about 20 months now. However this past few months I have notice it's not having the same effect as before. She's staring to limp, and wakes up with her fingers too stiff to move them. Hoping is just a flare.",DinalLL
5,Etanercept,Juvenile Rheumatoid Arthritis,,,"April 12, 2016",6,Enbrel (etanercept):I was diagnosed at the age of 6 with JRA ( juvenile rheumatoid arthritis). At 8 my doctor prescribed me to embrel. I started of taking it once a week. It worked wonders. I wasn't limping anymore. Nearly pain free just the slight stiffness once in awhile. I am now 16 and currently only take it every 15 day or twice a month.,tiffinay

8,Etanercept,Juvenile Rheumatoid Arthritis,9.0,,"July 27, 2011",11,"Enbrel (etanercept):I'm a 15 year old female, and I have been using the Enbrel Sureclick Autoinjectors for about 12 weeks now for Juvenile Spondylo Arthritis in my left hip. It is a miracle! Before I started using this, I could barely walk and after the first 2 weeks of these injections, I was going to concerts, running track, and walking with no limp at all, whereas before, none of those were even possible for me. While the medicine works very well, I've noticed that my injection sight gets red, itchy, and swollen, and you can actually see where the injection fluid went in because there are multiple trails of bumps branching out from the injection sight. It's quite odd. Other than the redness and itching, this product is wonderful.",Anonymous
9,Etanercept,Juvenile Rheumatoid Arthritis,10.0,,"October 13, 2010",14,"Enbrel (etanercept):I have had Juvenile Rheumatoid Arthritis since 5th grade and until now (my sophomore year of college) I have had to use pills to keep it under control.  I will admit that I was very adverse to the idea of a self injecting medication, in fact, my doctor has been trying to convince me to use them for years and I have always refused.  Finally my doctor said that he thought it was the only good option left.  I couldn't be happier.  The injections are only once a week and they are virtually PAINLESS.  It sounds crazy but it's true.  The other amazing thing is that the morning after I had used the first injection, I was PAIN FREE. It worked that fast. If you're thinking about Enbrel you should really give it a try... you won't be disappointed.",Anonymous

She went from barely able to walk or get up in the morning to running and tackling her brother.  She still has flares, she still has bad days.  But thanks to Enbrel she's learning how to be a kid... something she didn't know before starting it.",Anonymous
11,Etanercept,Juvenile Rheumatoid Arthritis,8.0,,"September 2, 2008",17,Enbrel (etanercept):My 6 year old has been on Enbrel for about 3 months for JRA and Uveitis. I would give this medicine a 10 if it was working on her eyes as well as it is on her joints. Little to no swelling in affected joints but she is still having flares in her eyes. No side effects so far and she actually looks forward to the injection because it makes her feel better.,Anonymous
