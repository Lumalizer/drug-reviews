0,Celecoxib,Juvenile Rheumatoid Arthritis,8,,"July 5, 2015",22,"Celebrex (celecoxib):At 17 years old I have finally seen a rheumatologist. I got, a shot of corticosteroid which immediately made my knee and back feel 100% better. And a starter pack with 12 Celebrex samples. The celebrex didn't cause any noticeable side effects and the pain eased. I finally have my own prescription of Celebrex. I take it every now and then if the pain is not bearable. But I like to just ride out with no medication because I'm used to the flare ups. I feel weird about taking Celebrex everyday because it is a black box drug; I'm too young to start damaging my liver. All in all; Celebrex works when you need it.",Rebelosa
