1,Brilinta,Prevention of Atherothrombotic Events,2.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"December 28, 2019",15,"Had 100% blockage in left leg. Stent was advised,  but not put in - Instead, the artery was cleared. Was put on Brilinta 90mg twice daily. I experienced severe breathing difficulty after only 2 days, to the point I needed supplemental oxygen. I was unable to sleep more than a few minutes at a time. 2 days after quitting this drug, my breathing was back to normal.",Anonymous
2,Brilinta,Prevention of Atherothrombotic Events,5.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"October 20, 2019",13,"After having a stent placed, I was put on 90 mg of Brilinta twice daily. On the second day of taking, my headaches started along with the shortness of breath,  also nausea and back pain on the third day. This continued and on the fifth day, I had to be admitted back in to the hospital with what I thought to be a heart attack.  While in the hospital I experienced quite a bit of blood in my urine. It was decided to take me off of Brilinta and start me on Plavix. I'm on my second day of Plavix and already doing much better!",Farmgirl
3,Brilinta,Prevention of Atherothrombotic Events,3.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"April 12, 2019",22,"While on the table after having  two stents put in, the doctor took me off Plavix and gave me 4 Brilinta. For the next 3 weeks, I felt that the doctor had not put a stent in my heart, but rather somehow clogged it, for I had shortness of breath just like a heart attack. I couldn't go to sleep  for forcing myself to take deep breaths which didn't seem to fill my need for air. My regular cardiologist took me off the Brilina and put me back on Plavix. No problems now and it cleared up within a day or two.",Living

5,Brilinta,Prevention of Atherothrombotic Events,5.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"April 19, 2018",19,"I have been on Brillinta for 30 days, I am also an asthmatic so breathing is always a problem. This medication does not make it any easier. I remember waking up because it felt like someone was covering my mouth and nose. I could not catch my breath. I am always tired body aches, lightheaded. Yes I do bleed heavy when it is a small cut. I bruise very easily. Everyday I wake up I have a new purple, red black and green bruise. As time goes on the breathing is not as bad. The bruising is still horrible. I pray one day soon I will be off this medication.",Anonymous
6,Brilinta,Prevention of Atherothrombotic Events,8.0,,"January 30, 2018",33,"At 90 years of age and after an MI and 2 stents, I started 90 mgs Brilinta twice daily and 88 mgs aspirin daily  After reporting excessive bruising, aspirin was reduced to every other day.   A few weeks later, I  suffered dysonea severe enough that I thought of another MI.  Even after the Brilinta dosage was reduced to 60 mgs twice daily, I experience mild dyspnea for a few hours after a dose.  I am sleeping several hours a day longer than before.  Though I also take lisinopril, metropolol and Liptor, Brilinta appears to be the only drug with unpleasant side effects.  I would be interested to know how much lower might be the incidence of clotting with Brilinta as compared to aspirin alone.   I really don't like the stuff.",Doctor Tim
7,Brilinta,Prevention of Atherothrombotic Events,8.0,,"November 7, 2017",12,"I had a stent installed in right ventricle at 80% blockage. And then I was put on Brilinta for 1+ year. Minimal problems.  Minor bruising in last few weeks.  Minor bleeding early on. Can't tell if it's affecting breathing since I'm also on other meds (statin, metoprolil, lisiniprol ... pardon spelling errors).I was a runner, now am walk/jogger...a few miles/day, few times a week.  Still experience some pressure/breathing occurrences during first few minutes, then I walk, and restart jogging. After a while (10-15 minutes, about a mile)  this tends to go away and I can jog a little longer. No way to determine if any of the meds contribute to this.  I look forward to stopping Brilinta very soon. Hope it helps the breathing/pressure  but am pessimistic",StoneyEnd
8,Brilinta,Prevention of Atherothrombotic Events,,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"October 3, 2017",11,"I had three stents put in on July 17, 2017. The surgery was very easy and successful. I was immediately put on Plavix which did not agree with me. I was then put on Brilanta and am doing ok with it it seems. However, I do get dizzy, feel fatigued and bruise horribly. My worst problem is being unable to take anything for pain for my arthritis and spinal stenosis. I sustained pinched nerves on C7 during the surgery and not being able to get a cortisone shot or even take an Aleve for pain and inflammation has literally made my life miserable. I was not told anything about having to expect these side effects either. Iâ€™m grateful for the stents but how can I improve the quality of my life while staying on this blood thinner for a year?",Ms. D
9,Brilinta,Prevention of Atherothrombotic Events,4.0,Taken for 10 years or more,"September 26, 2017",12,"I had 1 stent placed March 2017. put on Brilinta 90 mg twice a day with baby aspirin in the morning. Shortness of breath started a week and 1/2 into cardio rehab. Was told as long as I could handle the shortness of breath it was more important to continue taking the drug. I called cardiologist about an inhaler. This time I am told that is for my primary to deal with. I am tired always, nap almost daily and now am anaemic. The anaemia adds to the shortness of breath and fatigue. I have also developed PICA. All I want to eat are dry rolled oats. I assume for the starch because it sure isn't for the taste. I can't wait for my one year to be over. The upper and lower GI I now have coming up are not what I planned on.",Anonymous
10,Brilinta,Prevention of Atherothrombotic Events,,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"September 16, 2017",6,I have not experienced any clots or clogged stints. I do experience a lot of shortness of breath and bad fatigue. Both are side effects of Brilinta. Overall it's a good medicine.,Lardav
