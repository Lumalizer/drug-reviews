1,Bupropion,Smoking Cessation,5.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"February 2, 2022",4,"Zyban (bupropion):Not as effective as champix. Really requires a lot of willpower during the first week of cessation. Stopped using zyban after the first few days off the cigs, my motivation is high but it definitely helped. Side effects were restless nights and strange dreams. Felt much worse taking champix but that is more effective. Give Zyban a go while Champix is unavailable but be prepared to push through the first week or so.",Rigs

7,Bupropion,Smoking Cessation,9.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"January 14, 2022",1,"Zyban (bupropion):After smoking for almost 30 years I am proud to say I have not smoked in 4 months thanks to Zyban. I felt strange taking it in the first 10 days and it made me not want to smoke because I had sort of a physical reaction when I tried to. It was weird, my throat felt like it was closed off so the cigarettes were no longer enjoyable. I thought I would have to stop spending time with smokers but the Zyban helped so much that I didn’t even mind when someone smoked in front of me. I also only took one pill a day instead of upping the dose to 2 after 10 days. I spoke with my doctor about this  and she said it was ok as long as I felt one would help me kick the habit. I think that only being on one per day made withdrawals easier when it came time to come off the meds. My lungs feel so much better, I am glad I don’t stink anymore, the money I’m saving is incredible and my daughter is no longer afraid that I will die.  I recommend Zyban, expect to feel strange for the first while.",Kerri

The third week I had days where I felt completely down & every day I felt sick and slept A LOT. Just as I was about to give up and try another avenue I woke up one morning 28 days in & didn't want to vap & ALL of the side effects went away!

Falling asleep every night fast and I wake up happy/well rested. 5- Increased libido- Maybe just feeling better overall causes this. 9/10 rating because of the initial side effects. I had an odd taste in my mouth for about 3 weeks, some nausea for the first few days, and night sweats for about a week. Again, could have been related to smoking withdrawal as well.

If tried everything and I still went back to smoking. Zyban was my last chance. I smoked at first and started to taper off. If there were side effects I don't really remember them. It took three weeks before I had the guts to not smoke. I list the cravings rather quicker than I thought possible. I haven't smoked for 12 years now. I still can't believe I'm a non smoker. Even at the worst time in my life I still never felt like a cigarette. I can honestly say I'm not a reformed smoker. I  truly a non smoker.,Michelle G

I'm no longer taking the medication and do feel like I want a drag or two. All in all, I would say it is a miracle drug...no matter what people tell you, it IS worth it. Be sure to follow what your doctor tells you, it's plain and simple: 2 tablets per day for 9-12 weeks and you will never ever smoke, if that is really what you want. I hope it helps everyone the same way it helped me.",MK7

I only experienced a few mild side effects (slight constipation, food tasted a bit different).  But I'd tried quitting before using gum, microtabs, patches - and none of these worked for me.

My second time smoking I could only smoke half...the third time I lit it and threw it away.

I feel, craving food, mainly sweets, have replaced craving cigarettes.  I am starting to cut down on the medication, I want off of it.  Become nervous, can't sit still, even come to tears, if I don't eat when the craving hits.  Wake in the night just starving, I lay there twisting and turning.  All this and I walk at least 2 to 3 miles daily.  Yes, I would rate this medication great to quit smoking, but hopefully you will be someone that has weight loss.",SMM47

I started with the nicotine patch but didn't want to use it anymore because if I wanted nicotine I would smoke a cigarette. Anyway I started, and since starting it I have quit smoking. I no longer have the urge even if I'm around some one smoking! The only side effect I have with it is it makes me nod off for about an hour to an hour in a half then I wake up and I'm a little groggy but can't sleep even after that for a couple of hours so I take it at night other than that I thank God for it!
