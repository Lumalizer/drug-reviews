0,Topiramate,Smoking Cessation,10.0,Taken for 10 years or more,"September 27, 2021",2,I was prescribed topirimate for epilepsy and have been on it for 10 years. I quit smoking within 2 weeks of starting the medication and have hated smoking since. Cannot even smoke 1 cigarette and I used to be 30 a day. I would t recommend it purely for smoking cessation but it is a definite plus point,Unintended 100%
1,Topiramate,Smoking Cessation,8.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"April 9, 2020",28,"Topamax (topiramate):I was prescribed Topamax for migraines, but because this drug treats so many conditions, it had several unintended benefits. I've been on it now for about 2 months and have cut my vaping in half, lost about 2 inches from my waist, and reduced nerve pain caused by neuropathy in my legs. It actually does better for these conditions I have than for migraines, but does help with them as well. There are some nasty side effects in the first few weeks, so keep that in mind if you are prescribed this med for any reason, they should dissipate with time. I call it the do-all-drug because there are about a dozen off label uses for it. I enjoy vaping and wasn't happy, but it is saving me money! For smoking, the main study shows that about 40% are able to abstain for over 2 years. I smoked for 25 years before vaping the last 10, and it is very effective in curbing my cravings, even giving me a sense of aversion to the vaping experience.",GB
2,Topiramate,Smoking Cessation,,Taken for less than 1 month,"September 15, 2016",1,"I'm probably a very rare case, I'm being prescribed Topamax 25mg at night as needed for sleep through the withdrawal of a prescribed pain medicine from a car accident. It is being prescribed only temporarily for two months.After reading all of these reviews, I am now terrified of hair loss as I grow my hair to donate for almost 20 years now. I have always had very thick wavy/curly hair and felt others could benefit from it and liked giving back.Can anyone please give their input on if they think the temporary use of this medication will effect my hair ? Thank you so much in advance.",Lil one
3,Topiramate,Smoking Cessation,2.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"December 23, 2015",24,"Topamax (topiramate):Horrific experience! It was working, but had to stop to protect sanity. Side effects were SO AWFUL, that I give it a ""2"" rating, despite effectiveness of quitting, a ""9"". Piece of cake to reduce by half, in a matter of days, with zero effort. 46 year smoker. Had to stop before ever reached full dosage. Almost went to ER, to have myself admitted for psych treatment. (Also lost 20lbs., in one month, with no effort.) Trust me - I would have loved to have stayed on it. Some effects - mild paranoia, visual and auditory hallucinations, cry at drop if a hat, intense sense of insecurity, inadequacy, fear of loss of self-control. 3 months later, still smoking about 25% less and 10lbs loss. Other side effects I can't recall, except acne and weird skin rash.",supersmoker
4,Topiramate,Smoking Cessation,,,"September 3, 2014",24,"Topamax (topiramate):This slows down my smoking but I haven't quit yet. It puts me in a better mood and mom said its to lose weight but I don't think so. The one to lose weight is phentermine. I take Topamax 100 mg twice a day, atenolol at night, and Klonopin at night. Atenolol sleeps my body and kKlonopin sleeps my mind and it makes dream really good like the show fat guy stuck in internet. It just puts you in your fantasy at night.",Moocowdisease
