I was able to completely be smoke free caffeine and soda and junk food free in almost no time - a couple 3 months most and stayed like that for a long time. I had no side effects after 3 months of therapy with chantix with no NRT or therapy when it went it got recalled. After long months of Buproprion I'm finding it near impossible to quit cigarettes completely again and realize my goal of remaining cigarette and nicotine free",Chantix
1,Varenicline,Smoking Cessation,10.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"February 18, 2022",0,Champix (varenicline):Champix or Chantix will work if it is tailored. I smoked 20 per day and my lungs were complaining and it worked for me but I had to tailor it to work for me. I took 1/2 tablet each morning for 4 days and smoked. Then took 1 each morning and after a few days I started feeling nauseous if I smoked so this put me off smoking but soon realised that coffee was a factor too. So I decided I cannot do without my morning cuppa so I moved the Champix/Chantix to the evening. 2 weeks later I had stopped smoking. The nausea stopped so I tried a cigarette and felt nauseous so no more smokes. 18 months later I don’t want a cigarette and don’t even think about smoking. I’m cured. In the UK more people would give up successfully if it wasn’t for the counselling. It’s not necessary and causes stress in itself which causes people to smoke.,rita.g

I wanted to smoke less right away, and from the end of week 1 to about week 2 and 1/2, I was smoking 1-3 cigs a day. I was a pack a day smoker for about 20 years. I haven’t had a smoke since 11/30. I have had moments of strong cravings but it feels more like it’s not that I want to smoke, it’s that I don’t know what to do with myself sometimes. Hoping that feeling goes away with time. It’s mostly been manageable…some mood swings, anxiousness, irritability, fatigue. I take it with food, so haven’t had any stomach issues. And the dreams. Holy crap they are vivid and WEIRD. I actually look forward to them! I still have some doubts here and there that I can stay smoke free, so I’m gonna stay on for probably at least another month and hope to feel stronger. I don’t think I would have gotten this far without the help of chantix.",Ka2112

I had never experienced anything like that before. I visited the ER twice (first when the symptoms appeared, and then 1 week later) because of this, but thankfully I was cleared of any physical problems. Another side effect I experienced was the intense bloating all over my abdomen, which was really uncomfortable (I didn't feel like I had any gas or any indigestion problems, just this meaningless bloating). I also went to the doctor for this and he prescribed some medicine that might help. My understanding is that this is a very dangerous drug (its side effects basically include all the illnesses on earth), be very careful after you start taking it, be on the lookout for any out-of-the-ordinary symptoms, and immediately seek medical help if you have any symptoms. I personally stopped taking it, considering all the problems it caused me.",Smart_sed

I get a letter from Walgreens stating to discontinue using Chantix because a certain lot number has been recalled, due to patients being diagnosed with cancer. What a shock! I go to my pulmonary doctor appointment the same week, and I show her the letter and she tells me that’ it’s on recalling boxes with the lot number’. She didn’t care, talking about she wanted to use me in a study. I most certainly think not! I don’t care what lot number they’re using.

My husband smokes and this does not bother me at all.  I agree with the other comments that in the beginning I didn't know what to do with myself when I had ""triggers"". I didn't want a cigarette but starting new habits was important.Important to know - When I quit with Chantix it is different than any other product.

All cold turkey attempts failed because of the extreme withdrawal symptoms. Several times attempted nicotine replacement therapy with nicotine lozenges, gum, and patches. Although it was able to reduce smoking, nicotine dependence remained. I had to use Snus at night to prevent waking up to get a smoke. Mild side effects, but the lack of mental focus was semi debilitating. One week and two days after my first pill, I completely quit all forms of nicotine. On day three of nicotine withdrawal, I had virtually every side effect of quitting except for the cravings. One month nicotine-free and reduced Chantix for the last week and haven’t had a pill in over 24 hours.

The whole vivid dreams side effect was surreal, although I didn't have any bad dreams, it was just strange to feel and remember my dreams so well. Also, I suggest taking an anti-nausea medication or just not eating spicy or greasy foods while taking it to prevent nausea.

I was a smoker for ± 15 Years and then after taking Champix quit and started Twisping (Electronic Cigarette) After 8 years of Twisping I decided to go back on Champix. It worked. I had the worst dreams for 6 weeks, including constant nausea, headaches, mood swings, and feeling just feeling really ill.All I can say is that you need to just take each day at a time. Do not give up. If you feel depressed, anxious, or suicidal you need to speak to your doctor or a loved one. You can also read up on the internet as to how to manage your depression. I did have severe anxiety and fits of rage on maybe 3 occasions. My loved ones were informed about the side effects I was experiencing and were understanding.These forums helped me on my Champix Journey as I did not feel like all the horrible symptoms I had were just me.",ROXY H - South Africa

47,Varenicline,Smoking Cessation,1.0,,"February 25, 2021",5,Chantix (varenicline):My time I used chantix on the 9th day I attacked my husband for laughing at the tv. I told him I didn't have to hear him laugh and if he didn't shut up he could leave. I thought since I was better aware I could manage it the second time I went on chantix. My second experience with chantix was a bit different. In day 8 I cried cause I wanted the feel good of a cigarette. On day 9 I felt like I was on speed. I was excited to not be smoking and thrilled to be alive. I didn't want to go to bed and when I did I couldn't wait to wake up. When I did I was lower than I've ever been. Extremely depressed. I didn't want to be alive. I didn't get enjoyment from cigarettes but I also had a complete loss of soul. I decided I wasn't taking them anymore and I went to bed. When I woke up in the night I knew I felt better and today I am myself again. Smoking or loss of soul and spirit? Smoking or losing your mind? It is my belief that I would have quit smoking with chantix but I would have lost my mind.,Dnlee

My side effects is extremely painful ulcers/dry mouth and mouth thrush, the worst pain I have ever had. Still on mouth wash from doctors 3 weeks on, but not going back to smoking now.

Dreams were a little vivid, mild nausea with the morning pill some times.  My advice, eat and drink a full glass of water when you take the medication.  Most of the time it didn't bother me and if it did it only lasted 15 minutes.  My other advice, don't drink alcohol and/or take recreational drugs with this medication. Also, alcohol lowers your willpower.  So just commit to a few months of no alcohol to change the rest of your life!",Bonnie Ellen

Here’s how Chantix helped me.One day you will get tired and hate smoking . Be strong , don’t let anything little excuse triggers smoking . Be strong . 3 days nicotine urge is gone. The biggest fight is the mental habits. Mentally something we did for years . The same routine every day . Light up before bed,Toilet, after work , before sex after sex, meals, rainy , sunny .etc. I still reach In my pocket till today. Every time you get the urge, loudly ask yourself. WHY DO I SMOKE. By the way I joined a gym and gave up coffee. Coffee and cigarettes did go hand in hand for me.So go get chantix and you will thank yourself. Gums, nicotine patches, e-cigs really makes matter worse.Good luck . Thank you chantix.",Fee

I did have very vivid enhanced dreams, but nothing scary or nothing that bothered me.  I do want to add though, if you are on any psychiatric medications, I'd use caution and talk to your doctor.  I have been on medication for bipolar for over 20 years, and haven't had any kind of relapse for over 10 years.  However, while on this drug,  I did have a set back with some depression and mood swings, where I had to take a 3 week leave of absence from work.

These tablets really do work but obviously do come with certain side effects?!I have found it’s an absolute definite to take them just after eating (at least 2 pieces of toast or so for AM and a proper meal for PM.)The nausea is horrific if you take them on an empty stomach as I found on my first attempt with champix.I have also been suffering with really bizarre nightmares/dreams?Quite cranky and easily irritated  - suppose it’s expected though?This time around I have struggled getting out of bed of a morning, but I don't struggle going to sleep - if anything I could sleep longer (normally have a good 8-9 hours a night??)Feel a bit flat some days and no motivation or energy.Definitely think they are worth a go though - Good luck!!!!",Chuck

This is a very effective, powerful drug that makes quitting easy. However it does come with a lot of side effects which are not just nicotine withdrawal. I went down to a half dose after 6 weeks as I was off my head and unable to function normally. As soon as the drug hit my bloodstream my head was spinning, I’d feel completely overwhelmed physically and had to lie down. Couldn’t work, think or even go out on the streets I was so disoriented. Champix also affected my decision-making - even shopping became a massive ordeal. As soon as I cut the dose in half the craziness stopped. The drawback of course is that you then feel the cravings more acutely. Looking back, I’ve felt rubbish the whole time I’ve been on this with endless ailments, which is completely unlike me. I can’t wait to come off it. Would I recommend it? Yes, but realise you’re in for a ride. Good luck and keep pushing through!",Rosie

But the anxiety I felt at the thought of not having my four fags on the way into work and back filled me with fear. I started champix three weeks ago. No major side effects, slight nausea, hilarious dreams, and the feeling that it was doing something but I wasn’t sure what. After day three on the tablets I tested myself. Had wine one evening without a fag....felt ok. Travelled to work with no smoking on the journey and felt ok. Cigarettes started to taste odd...but I continued until my quit day which was day 8 for me. Not quite sure what the tablets do but my fear, my crutch, the evil longing just subsided. I’ve not had a cigarette for 11 days now and I’m down to two 0.5 tablets a day. Feeling fairly smashing. Cannot believe I’m doing it to be honest. So going to continue keeping on going. Good luck everyone giving it a go. Hope it works for you...as no one needs these in their lives!! X",Kat22

I actually hadn't realised you were meant to stop within this period. Armed with a script for a further 4 weeks worth I embarked on the next phase . After smoking for 40 years and with several failed attempts to stop I was a tad sceptical as to how successful this would be . So 2 months after starting the course I am now cigarette free for 8 days !!!! and quietly proud of myself . Am also 4 days free of champix  which I am even happier about !!! I am usually not prone to side-effects on medication , but managed to suffer through most of the possible ones listed , so the last 2 months have been quite an ordeal !! Was lethargic , disinterested and tired the whole time , wild dreams made worthwhile sleep difficult , so after 7 weeks was happy to stay off the smokes just to be free of the side-effects !!

I took it for about two months actually while still smoking, but it just made smoking less pleasant. I would smoke and realized halfway through I didn't want it. After about two weeks of use I was only smoking 10 cigarettes a day as opposed to 20. For the last month or so I was smoking 4-5 cigarettes a day. It was tough at first not smoking at all, but it was really more just out of habit. I didn't really crave cigarettes too much. If you're able to afford it I really suggest you try it. Even if it's a little pricey for you, it's totally worth it. I smoked for 15 years and I haven't had a cigarette in almost a month.",cory

However, I got ""stuck"" on nicotine gum and never was able to kick it.   Using this time around to give-up the gum once and for all.  Some advice.  First be careful not to confuse the affects of quitting smoking with Chantix side affects.  Quitting is a cow and there is not way around that.  You won't feel good at first.  Second, the first time around I DID had moderate side effects, nausea mostly and that spaced-out bubble head feeling. To the point of wanting to stop using it.  But I worked with my doctor to find the right dosage. It's what doctors called a titration dosing and they do it all the time with drugs.   If you find yourself with intolerable side effects, don't give up on Chantix.  Adjust the dosage yourself before throwing it on the garbage pail or better yet ask your doctor if they can help titrate your dose. Good luck!",Efrommn

Started 28 days ago.  Nic fits are very short and forgettable. You can feel a little weird at the start and experience a kind of tinny taste sometimes but that goes away.  I took one pill in the morning and one at mid-afternoon to avoid any sleep / dream issues.  Very impressed. Has made quitting really easy for me so far.  With Champix I think the only way to fail is if you make yourself fail.,Anonymous
403,Varenicline,Smoking Cessation,1.0,,"November 17, 2017",12,"Chantix (varenicline):Here is what nicotine does to your brain...Nicotine also can have effects on the parts of the brain that sense pleasure. When nicotine gets into the brain, it is able to stimulate the release of a neurotransmitter called dopamine. Dopamine activates some of the neurons in the part of the brain that register pleasure. As a result, nicotine triggers a chemical sensation of pleasure, which causes people to associate tobacco use with a feeling of pleasure.Here is what Chantix does to it...Chantix messes with the part of the brain that senses pleasure, looks forward to things, has hope for tomorrow.  It takes that all away. I took Chantix and the effects were catastrophic.  Needed three meds to counter it.  Stay away!",AnnieMagnolia

I didn't plan a quit date, I just naturally got to a point where I felt ""ready"" and wasn't going to bother with more cigarettes. Champix forces much needed time away from nicotine and cigarettes so that you can get mentally and emotionally prepared to be a nonsmoker for life. I feel amazing already!",CourtneyG

A friend told me about Champix (UK name) but I read reviews & was scared to use it. But last month I started it. I'm now on day 16, age 53, quit on day 12. I truly think it's a wonder pill.
