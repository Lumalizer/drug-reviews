0,Naltrexone,Smoking Cessation,,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"February 22, 2021",8,I used to smoke a pack a day as well as drink 18 beers a day. I started taking (LDN-low dose naltrexone) Naltrexone with Bupropion 3 years ago. Since then I am unable to smoke or be around smoke without feeling nauseous. I'm amazed at how much money I saved in cigarettes and beer. But better than that. I can breathe!! I can exercise!! I can go anywhere and not have to worry about when I can have my next cig or drink.,lamoismynamo
