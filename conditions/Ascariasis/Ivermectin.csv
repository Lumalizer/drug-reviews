2,Ivermectin,Ascariasis,10,Taken for less than 1 month,"November 16, 2016",56,"Broad spectrum antiparasitic that works by paralyzing the invader so it loses its grip and is flushed out safely and without releasing its internal contents which can cause aggravating reaction to toxins within.Well tolerated, safe, and effective against many different types of parasites some of which are still unidentified.Not effective for pinworm, hookworm, or trichinosis but when combined with subsequent albenzadole or mebenzadole use will erradicate the majority of offending known and some unknown parasites. Be sure to use as directed and do a short course follow up retreatment as it may not work against eggs or cysts forms which may take 7-14 days to hatch.This medicine has a long half life and doses tend to be cumulative for days",ClintNYtoVA
