1,Carbamazepine,Peripheral Neuropathy,10,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"November 24, 2018",10,"This medicine helped tremendously with neurological pain from multi-level spinal cord compression.  This was the only nerve pain medication which helped me to some degree by lowering the severity of the nerve pain from 10 ER level to about a 6 level I-Can-Get-Through-This pain.  Unfortunately, I could only stay on it for a couple of months because it had very bad interactions with amlodipine BP med, causing increased severe side effects and loss of vision.",Patrizian
2,Carbamazepine,Peripheral Neuropathy,1,,"July 18, 2017",5,"made me extremely sleepy, I would wake up in strange places i.e. kitchen floor with no knowledge of how I got there.  Most importantly it didn't help with nerve pain in my feet at all.",realdeal54
3,Carbamazepine,Peripheral Neuropathy,9,,"February 29, 2016",12,"I had shingles 10 years ago in my mouth and it developed into Trigiminal Neuropathy on th eleft side of my head. ! year ago, I started with a terrible burning,electrical shok like feeling on my left foot. My toes burn terrible, My right foot feels as if it is wrapped in Plastic wrap all of the time up to my calf. My left foot feel s the same but with my toes burning. I have been taking Cymbalta,60 mgs per da(20 mgs 3 times a day) I have also been on Tegretol (800mgs per day) for 2 years. I finally had very little pain in my feet so I dropped from the 800 mgs a day of Tegretol to 600 mgs last Monday. I thought I was taking the Tegretol for my mouth burning constantly from the Trigiminal Neuralgia and Migraines and thought I'd give it a try to drop down to the 600 mgs to see if it made any difference. Since last MOnday, my right toes are burning constantly again, and I've had migraines caused from the Trigiminal Neuralgia. I am DEFINITELY CONVINCED Tegretol along with Cymbalta have been my saving grace from pain. The two, together are almost stopping my pain completely in my head AND MY FEET. It's amazing the difference and only since last MOnday. If you can take Tegretol AND Cymbalta together I suggest doing it. Both are great medicines.",Schmiliz
4,Carbamazepine,Peripheral Neuropathy,1,,"September 7, 2015",22,"A neurologist prescribed carbamazepine for my wife to treat persistent pain in the area of her surgery (brain tumor). She was on this drug for two months and it did not have any affect on her pain. It did almost kill her so BE VERY CAREFUL if you take this drug and have side effects such as low energy, drop in blood pressure, dizzy spells, etc.  This can be a dangerous drug - in our case it depleted sodium levels and my wife almost went into a coma. It is her third day in the hospital after having to call 911 when she collapsed - she is slowly recovering.",Anonymousnb

7,Carbamazepine,Peripheral Neuropathy,6,,"December 2, 2011",36,Tegretol (carbamazepine):It took approximately 3 months for the Tegretol to have any effect. When it did it was almost overnight. Also found that taking Xanax with it helps tremendously (with Doctor approval of course). I take up to 3 mg Xanax with 3 times daily and 200 mg Tegratol 2 times daily.  It really works.  The burning has almost ceased.,Anonymous
