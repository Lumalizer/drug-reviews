I woke up extremely dizzy 4 days ago and it hasn’t gone away. It’s almost like a vertigo/hungover feeling. I have trouble walking, my balance is totally off and I cant see straight. I have to hang on to the wall or other things most of the time when I walk. I also feel some nausea off and on. I was taking 300mg for my first 2 days at bedtime but doubled it after that because it didn't seem to help. After I doubled it I then finally slept through the night without toe pains. But now I’m taking at least 6 Antivert and Zofran a day together just to keep the nausea away so of course now I’m just drowsy and sleepy all day. I’m going to have to stop this med if this doesn’t stop because it really isn’t possible to function this way.",Alwaysdizzy

First I was on 100 mg x 3/day, then 600 mg x 1 at night, now I am taking 1800 mg/day (at 600 mg three times a day). Despite sugars under control the pain is progressively worse especially at night. The burning, sharp pains feel like tiny needles sticking me. Now I have skin hypersensitivity. It feels like sandpaper rubbing against my thighs when I walk. I have severe muscle tenderness. Just bending my legs cause soreness in my thighs that won't go away. I stand when I eat. The neuropathy has spread to my shins and I have sharp pains  in my feet. At first I thought it was insulin neuritis. So I researched medications that cause peripheral neuropathy and anticonvulsants was #1.

10,Gabapentin,Peripheral Neuropathy,10.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"April 11, 2021",9,"Gabapentin has been a lifesaver for me. I have antimag (anti myelin-associated glycoprotein) neuropathy and paresthesia. Life would be too much of a struggle if  it not for this drug. I get constant tingling from feet to thighs and finger tips to shoulders plus shooting nerve pain. Gabapentin relieves me from that so I only have weird patches of areas that are numb. I do want to point out that magnesium, caffeine, and marijuana stop the effectiveness of Gabapentin entirely so I don’t take any of those. The only side effect I have is I’ll have any hour where I get groggy or loopy feeling. Sometimes it’s a pleasant light high. Other than that I don’t have any side effects. I’m on 2400 mg a day taken in 4 pills of 600mg each. I think I started at 900mg a day. Now I’m starting to feel some tingling again so we’re looking for something else I can add.

15,Gabapentin,Peripheral Neuropathy,5.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"January 28, 2021",2,I have just begun a lot of gabapentin schedule. I have nerve impingement in the ulnar track not carpal tunnel. I have numbness and tingling in my forearms and most of my fingers. I have been prescribed gabapentin before but shied away from it when it made me so drowsy. My care provider suggested a lower dose and see if I can deal with that and then maybe work my way up. I want to know if anyone else has received relief in the way of return of feeling and flexibility of fingers after gabapentin. I do not really have pain as a lot of neuropathy patients do but I do have some shooting sharp flashes from time to time. I'm really hoping gabapentin can work and I plan on taking it through the next month thanks. Feedback welcome and I know it's different for everybody.,Anonymous
16,Gabapentin,Peripheral Neuropathy,5.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"January 20, 2021",6,"Pros of gabapentin: works for nerve pain; long-lasting pain relief; Cons of gabapentin: Side effects are terrible if you don't take it regularly; can cause phalanges to feel insufferably cold. I've been prescribed Gabapentin for numerous conditions. It didn't do much for my migraines but it does relieve pain from peripheral neuropathy, pinched nerves and lessened the pain of a break. However, I rarely use the medication due to it's terrible side effects. It caused my phalanges to feel cold and numb to the point where it effected my ability to work and efforts to regain warmth were short-lived. It'd also make me feel incredibly disoriented, foggy and experience a feeling comparable to derealization or oneirophrenia (is a hallucinatory, dream-like state ).  This effect is noticeable even at 100mg and last twelve to eighteen hours.  However, when I was taking it consistently while healing from a break the mental side effects were nearly nonexistent.",Bessy83

Started with 6 pills 300MG per day. Then few years later went down to 2 pills per day. Now up to 4 pills per day. I don't think it works anymore and I knew this would happen eventually. I could increase but I don't want to gain weight.Gabapentin numbs the nerve pain and lets me work and walk and keep up. At night before bed though is another story. I want to cut my feet off. The burning sometimes cramping is really bad. I could heat up a room with my feet.I'll look up other meds and find a better neurologist. Also changing my diet. I'm still young so I need to find something to help. Decades of pain are not fun to look forward to.I'm glad the drug worked this long. I'll also find some cbd oil to take now too.,itsme

24,Gabapentin,Peripheral Neuropathy,1.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"February 5, 2020",185,"I have been on gabapentin for about 4 years ending up with 600mg three times a day - it is for nerve pain. No help whatsoever for the searing pain  I still get. I believe it’s prescribed because it’s a cheap drug and only partly does the job. This drug was originally prescribed for people suffering from seizures and fits to control the brain and was considered useful for nerve pain. As far as I’m concerned it doesn’t work and there should be more research into this debilitating illness. Of course as a result of neuropathy you can get neuropathic ulcers which are incredibly painful. The NHS offer nothing for these. I’m not a diabetic, I don’t drink and don’t have any if the listed conditions which might cause neuropathy so Im pretty annoyed about the lack of knowledge in treating this illness.",Dingle Cricket

At 800mg's I became tipsy and began back stepping. Also, I felt the increase dosage wasn't meeting my need. I suspected a connection with the high increase so I decreased back to 400mg.

I did gain a lot of weight since it has reduced my motivation. Also have acne which I never had before. Muscles feel tight and when working out they become sore quickly. No sense of anxiety, very calm. A lot of small side effects including almost zero sex drive, but the reduction of the BURNING, CRUSHING NEEDLE FILLED sensation in my foot it is worth it.

I felt nauseous, and my thinking was not clear. An ER doctor prescribed Cymbalta, and that medicine has been a God send.
