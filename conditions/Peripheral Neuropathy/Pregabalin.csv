1,Pregabalin,Peripheral Neuropathy,9.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"August 28, 2021",1,"I was a heavy spirit drinker (whisky, rum, cognac and vodka).  So I developed early onset of peripheral neuropathy.Having tried to quit alcohol with rehab and other benzo based drugs which did not work.  So, I had open conversation with our family doctor who recommended Pregabalin 75mg twice a day.  This is helping my nerve pain and thoroughly helped my alcohol abstinence.  I did not suffer with any alcohol withdrawal symptoms.The down sides are being a male, enlarging breasts and a slight impact on erectile strength (not erectile deficiency) due to increasing Estrogen in male.  This is temporary and can be treated with Tadalafil and other Testosterone boosters/supplements.  This medicine will increase your appetite, hence weight gain.  So good to watch out for unhealthy food.  Balanced diet and regular exercise would do good.All in all to sum up, it curtailed my pain and gave me freedom from alcohol addiction.  I am totally sober.",A UK
2,Pregabalin,Peripheral Neuropathy,9.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"April 29, 2021",19,"I have had 12 back and hip related surgeries in 10 years...approximately half where fusions from cervical to mainly lumbar area, my last L2-L4 fusion continuation in Dec 2020- I am 56 years old..and for last 3 months since I have been experiencing severe neuropathic pain in my lower legs and feet—I have had to ice them every night to get 1 or 2 straight hours of sleep— it was agonizing.  Then 3 days ago I saw my neurosurgeon and he put me on a mix of 600mg ibuprofen 3 times a day and 150 mg Lyrica twice a day.  I woke today after a night of solid sleep completely neuropathic pain free. I felt blessed most incredible pain reversal I have ever had. I just pray it stays like this although Lyrica made me tired a bit ,the upside is so incredibly worth it for me.  I hope you other folks get to feel this—and I am so sorry other folks have not felt this level of relief/-I pray you get better!",Parkland guy
3,Pregabalin,Peripheral Neuropathy,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"December 24, 2020",2,This medication was absolutely horrible from the first time I took it I was so tired. I felt like I was going to throw up I also had a bad headache. I took it for two weeks to see if my symptoms would get better and  not at all! It didn’t help the burning pain I have literally the same day I stopped taking this medication my symptoms of the ones I mentioned up started to ease up. I still had my burning shooting pain but I didn’t feel absolutely sick.,Raydee

5,Pregabalin,Peripheral Neuropathy,2.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"April 21, 2020",26,"I've suffered from peripheral neuropathy for a year. I've tried gabapentin, tramadol, and pregabalin. Pregabalin was best for treating the burning, stabbing, pins, and needles in my hands and feet. It probably brought my pain down from a 6 to a 2. But, and it's a big BUT were the side effects. I was taking 100 mg twice a day, but I was a total wreck. I walked around like a zombie, I would just stare at my computer screen not really doing anything. Throw in some blurred vision and mild cognitive impairment and you have a really useless drug in my book.  If pain relief was the most important thing to me, I would stick with it. For me, after just a one week look at my future self (30 years from now), it was too much to bear. I'm going to keep searching.",Sparky

The Lyrica was helping & now they have changed to Pregabalin & the pain/numbness in my feet/legs/back has gotten bad again!",Lisa
7,Pregabalin,Peripheral Neuropathy,1.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"January 28, 2020",31,"After I started taking Lyrica, I finally felt hope.  I felt validated. I thought, this is what normal feels like. This is what it's like to go a day and live pain free.  Then, my pharmacy switched to Pregabalin and I'm back to 45 years ago.  Daily pain.  Hiding from the world sleeping through the pain.  I feel like that inner child that was confused as to why she felt so bad all of the time and my alcoholic mother said I was just using a negative attention getting mechanism to take away her attention.  I AM in pain.  I AM NOT making this up.  Why can't I have the Lyrica back?  I saw a glimpse of how I could be and I want the feel good ME back.  The me I know I'm supposed to be.  That I CAN be.

11,Pregabalin,Peripheral Neuropathy,7.0,,"November 27, 2019",12,"On Lyrica for 4 yrs under Pain Specialist. Was taking one 100 mg capsule AM, one 100 mg capsule mid day and two 100 mg capsules before bed for a total of 400 mg/day. My non-Diabetic Peripheral Neuropathy is unbearable without it. Only side effect is blurred vision, a small trade off for the relief offered.Now I am troubled. Finishing the last of my brand name Lyrica from my last 90 day script, I just started 400 mg/day of newly acquired generic pregabulin. Something is wrong! Painful electric bolts to my left lower extremity have increasingly returned, albeit in a less severe intensity. Note that I had rated this new med a ""7"", doing so in contrast to calling the brand name Lyrica a ""10"".  I am distraught. Are there any other such reports? How can I continue to obtain Lyrica regardless of the cost? Thanks very much for allowing me to report this to you. My Lyrica cost $50/month mail order and the pregabalin is only $5.",Tica
12,Pregabalin,Peripheral Neuropathy,,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"October 26, 2019",26,Have been taking Pfizer Lyrica for about a year. I order it from Kaiser mail order because I couldn't afford it otherwise.  The Pfizer product was EXCELLENT at controlling lower back pain.Kaiser substituted a generic. IT DOES NOT HAVE DESIRED PAIN RELIEF.  Science is apparently flawed here.,booms
13,Pregabalin,Peripheral Neuropathy,,Taken for less than 1 month,"September 22, 2019",30,"I was diagnosed with peripheral neuropathy 10+ yrs ago.  Pfizer/Lyrica helped with much of the burning & electric shock-like stabbing pain.  I was recently pleased to pick up the generic by Amneal Pharma.  Almost immediately I began getting painful shocks, toe stabbing pain, pain in hands, serious migraines and the most scary of all, heart palpitations.  After several days I cleared all of the generic lyrica  out of my pill minder box and luckily had nearly a weeks worth of the Pfizer product.I’m pleased to say that after only several days back on Lyrica  the shocking/stabbing pain and heart palpitations have been reduced.  I still have migraines but am hopeful they will go away.I’ll provide an update soon  as I believe many could benefit from this information before switching to generic.",Neuro-boy
14,Pregabalin,Peripheral Neuropathy,8.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"August 21, 2019",7,"I have been on Lyrica 150mg twice daily 3 years ago.  I was tired and had blurry vision.  My dose was reduced to 75mg twice daily and it worked very well to relieve the throbbing pains in my feet, muscle aches in my legs and sciatica pain which originally started after L4/L5 spinal surgery 3 years ago.  On the 75mg twice daily dose I had minimal side effects (bloating etc).  My doctor put me on a Transtec (Buprenorphine) patch and changed my Lyrica to 75mg once a day and it was wonderful because I was almost pain free for the first time in 3 years.  Unfortunately, recently the Transtec patch was removed from being covered by my insurance and is very expensive to buy.  Now I am back to Lyrica 75mg twice a day and it isn't as good as when used in combo with the Transtec patch but it is the next best thing.",Darrin

17,Pregabalin,Peripheral Neuropathy,,,"May 18, 2018",22,"Pregabalin is one of the worst drugs I have ever taken. The side affects are demoralizing. You do not function well, you sleep all the time.  How did it get approved by the F.D.A? The FDA need to be investigated. And they need put back real  testing of the  drugs in another way other than on the American public. It needs to be removed from the market as a hazardous material never to return.

He got overruled by a doctor with a brain, but doctor Weisman seems to think Lyrica does't work for the treatment of peripheral neuropathy his reasoning was because the doctor didn't put diabetic in front of peripheral neuropathy. Lyrica won't work the thing this doctors doesn't understand is that the Lyrica is treating only the peripheral neuropathy the diabetic part mean nothing except that the peripheral neuropathy is being cause by the diabetes.

I have all forms of Neuropathy, very painful and Lyrica has been the best so far at eliminating pain, allowing me to overcome the insomnia from the Neuropathy and opiate medication. Even at very small doses. I take 50mg once daily before bed and it works. The problem is the side effects, the worst being that after three days my eyesight is so degraded that I can not drive, I cannot read anything on the television 6 feet away, there is some eye pain and my eyes seem dry and burning. Eye problems can be serious. Wandering eye, crossed eyes and most commonly blurred vision. It also causes peripheral edema in my legs and feet.",Puffle

34,Pregabalin,Peripheral Neuropathy,7.0,,"July 11, 2010",20,Lyrica (pregabalin):The real problem I had and still do is dosing. I started out on 150mg twice a day and found it too much at first. GP reduced dose to 75mg three times a day and 1 x 75mg when needed. That is my current dose and the side effects are worth it based on the fact that I've had painful neuropathy in both my feet and lower legs. The breakthrough pain was the main issue I was having trouble with and DID NOT want any more narcotics than I currently take...60mg. MS Contin x 24hours and 2 Statex when required per 24 hours.

37,Pregabalin,Peripheral Neuropathy,8.0,,"November 3, 2009",30,"Lyrica (pregabalin):This used in conjunction with Cymbalta is about as good as it gets for nerve pain. In the past I was given Neurontin, Gabapentin, and many others but none were as effective. On the down side I found that the Lyrica in higher doses (150MG - 600MG)  left me tired and unable to enjoy my days. I found that I received no greater pain relief taking the larger doses, just more / worse side effects. Even with Lyrica and the Cymbalta some people with extreme pain may still need to use some other type of pain relief in addition to this drug. I take 300MG of Lyrica spread over 4 doses per day and the Cymbalta, and 120MG of OxyContin and up to 40MG Oxycodone for breakthrough pain. In severe cases, a second anti-depressant may be needed in addition to The Cymbalta to help fight the depression that comes with chronic pain.The big down side to both of these name brand medicines is the cost. A months supply of Lyrica with no insurance is over $330 and the Cymbalta will set you back just over $300 each month.
