0,Duloxetine,Peripheral Neuropathy,8.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"January 29, 2022",0,"I had terrible neuropathic pain in both arms for a number of years caused by cervical spondylosis. Finally I was referred to Pain Management and began duloxetine. I started with a lower dosage but went to 60mg once a day within 3 months. It took a while for the side effects to stop (constipation, sweating) but the neuropathic pain is almost non existent. I no longer wake up during the night with unbearable pain in my shoulders arms and hands. This is a HUGE improvement for me and I am so thankful for it.",Falling apart

What they won't tell you is how duloxetine/Cymbalta is highly addictive. I took it for a year. Once I went on a 3 day trip and forgot it. I was a nervous wreck. My Doctor added it to my Neuropathy cocktail. Only on the third attempt was I able to kick it. I wasn't a depressed person. I went through severe depression and thoughts of suicide while kicking this stuff. I believe it was unnecessarily engineered to be addictive.",Macman

18,Duloxetine,Peripheral Neuropathy,,,"July 8, 2017",24,"I  got breast cancer mets in my bones (mainly spine) in 2010 and had chemo. I recently was diagnosed with chemo induced peripheral neuropathy CIPN. I'm on Lyrica 250mg/day, which helps a bit. They tried all the anti-epileptics and most of the amnitriptiline family and gave up. My psychologist suggested Duloxetine. I've been on it two months and I'm loving it! The lightning strikes have abated but I still have a little burning, etc and still drop everything I pick up, bit without this drug the pain was intolerable! It has even helped with my cancer pain.  It has caused a bit of fogginess, occasional bouts of double vision and ringing in the ears - BUT that's nothing compared to the side effects I got from all the other concoctions.

Not sure which drug has caused some relief with the intense cold and pain feeling in my feet. It seems most folks are having problems with hot feelings along with pain in their feet. My feet are freezing. I'm 46 and my wife and I had a great sexual relationship. The Cymbalta has totally killed my libido and ability to get or maintain an erection. She's supportive, but I can't keep on with this diminished sex drive.

I was prescribed Gabapentin, which worked very well, unfortunately after about 13 mo, I developed an allergy to it, so my Dr prescribed Cymbalta, 30 mg 2x/ day and it has worked quite well also. The only side effect I have experienced is a bit of tiredness and sleeping more than before, but I have always been a poor sleeper, so this has been a bonus!During my annual checkup last week, my doctor suggested I try to go off Cymbalta to see if the nerve pain has improved.

It helped reduce my pain enough that I could stop most opioids, but drug side effects were worse than the pain. I had dry mouth, then nausea which went on every day until about a month after I stopped it. I woke up in a panic sometimes, after horrible nightmares which I hadn't had before. I began teeth grinding, chipped many teeth, and was advised to have a mouth guard made. My headaches worsened markedly. My blood pressure rose substantially. I itched, sweated, and passed gas horribly. I had difficulty passing urine. My doctor had no idea how to help me; all I would be told was to ""drink ginger tea"".

None of the meds prescribed gave me any relief until I was started on Cymbalta. It seemed miraculous, as within a week or so I had almost no pain or burning in my legs and feet. I'm on 60 mg daily, along with oxycodone (7.5 mg twice daily). In the last couple of years the Cymbalta is far less effective than it was initially, and I would have even more pain if it weren't for the oxycodone. I asked my doctor about increasing the Cymbalta to 90 mg, but he says you don't get much more relief beyond the 60 mg dose. It's very disappointing to have the effectiveness decrease.

My doctor recommended this drug even though I thought it was not a good idea to use a antidepressant  for pain since I had been on Lexapro for years for depression and panic disorder.  The Lexapro works well for my mental health issues. But since the doctor knows best I caved and made the switch.  At first I did not notice anything good or bad but with in the first couple of weeks I began waking up in the morning almost in a state of panic. I contacted my pharmacy and they recommended taking it in the morning and that this was fairly common.
