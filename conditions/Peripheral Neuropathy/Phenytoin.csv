0,Phenytoin,Peripheral Neuropathy,9.0,Taken for 10 years or more,"January 20, 2020",4,"First prescribe phenytoin for sleeping disorder 40+ years ago. Helped regulate sleep. 10 yrs later got extreme Graves disease no sleep for 2+ years. Took phenytoin 200mg to regulate sleep between isotopes, but noticed helped with muscle and joint pain. Then got connective tissue disease: debilitating with many splints. Asked for phenytoin. Along with idomethacin, totally cured. Amazing, terrible side effects every time tried to stop drug. Then aortic/bifemoral artery bypass. Now have neuropathy in partially numb legs cuz so many nerves cut during multiple repairs. I shouldn't need phenytoin, but whenever tried to wean off, my body felt like being poisoned and ever inch grates on me, so looks like I'll be taking 200mg forever with no side effects as long as continue. I'm a little thin person 74 with no arthritis or other health issues. I'll never know how else phenytoin influenced, but I think it helps with nerve pain and sleep regulation.",Jello
1,Phenytoin,Peripheral Neuropathy,,,"April 18, 2013",14,"Dilantin (phenytoin):I was diagnosed with epilepsy at the age of 8 years old, I was put on Dilantin. When I was 65, my neurologist changed my meds 3 or 4 times and I am now on Keppra twice a day with phenobarbatol at night. I haven't had a problem in 6 years, but I developed neuropathy which is a real pain. It makes me have balance problems.",Rogr
2,Phenytoin,Peripheral Neuropathy,1.0,,"October 26, 2011",13,"Dilantin (phenytoin):I am a 26 year old female who has neuropathy throughout her entire body (happened following surgery likely due to anesthesia, awful!). I have bad reactions to seizure medicines, this one being the worst- along with Trileptal.  This made me a complete lunatic.  I was anti social, scared to be around anyone but my mother, had a migraine for 3 days while taking, was angry- an absolute monster.  If you are a female and younger in age, I would suggest trying this medication with a good support system (mother or significant other) who can be with you at all times just in case you react like I did.","Michelle, 26 female"
