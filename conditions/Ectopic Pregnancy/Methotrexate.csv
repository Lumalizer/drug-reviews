1,Methotrexate,Ectopic Pregnancy,5.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"February 19, 2020",6,"I ended up needing 2 doses and begging them to not give me a third from my not-so-cozy hospital room where I was hooked up to a dilaudid pain pump because I was in a ridiculous amount of abdominal pain with a side dose of nausea and dizziness. The first injection was definitely much more than uncomfortable, and I am so sorry if you are dealing with this drug and an ectopic. I still have PTSD when I hear it mentioned in commercials. I was exhausted, nauseous, and in pain for a bit over a week when they hit me with the second dose and it was game over after that.",TheProf
2,Methotrexate,Ectopic Pregnancy,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"August 12, 2019",10,"I was given 2 doses of methotrexate for ectopic pregnancy.  10 days after my second dose a rapidly growing tumor appeared on my leg.  The drug had lowered my immune system so much that a virus which causes an extremely rare and aggressive cancer was able to invade my body.  It turns out this drug has a high association with an increased risk of non-melanoma skin cancers.   My oncologists agreed it was likely this drug that caused my cancer, and I ended up needing surgery and radiation. This drug is extremely dangerous.",MethotrexateShouldBeBanned
3,Methotrexate,Ectopic Pregnancy,10.0,,"November 16, 2016",21,"My Methotrexate injections made me feel like absolute trash, BUT I am so thankful for this medication because it kept me from needing exploratory surgery to find my ectopic pregnancy. My ectopic was caught very early on due to being monitored with an RE. My number never went above 285. I was given the injection on 10/18/16 and my HcG levels were back down to negative as soon as 11/1/16. The only downside (other than the physical side effects) is that we have to wait 3 more months to try again because the drug can cause birth defects. I felt very weak and tired for a few weeks after my injection but after less than 1 month I'm starting to feel like myself again. If you're reading this and just found out you're having an ectopic-I'm so sorry.",MTXthrowaway
4,Methotrexate,Ectopic Pregnancy,7.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"September 27, 2015",6,"Ectopic pregnancy, 11 weeks. Was not warned about the side effects other than I would have cramping and pain. Day 1 after methorexate not too bad, definitely nauseous & lower back cramping, then toward the end of day 2 and day 3 & 4 I felt like I had been hit by a truck. Terrible nausea, felt like my body was made of lead, no strength, no energy, strong labor like pain & all over malaise.",valley view
