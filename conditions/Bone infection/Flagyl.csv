0,Flagyl,Bone infection,1,Taken for less than 1 month,"May 6, 2020",4,"Broke my big toe  (tip completely fractured. Had to have toe nail removed as in office surgery. Had two meds prescribed. Flagyl 400 mg and Flucloxacillin. Redness in my eyes and a bit woozy on my feet. Eye pain on top and back of eyes on second day. Sleep well ...too well. Stayed sleepy throughout the day.  With prospect of 9 day course I have contacted my doctor to ask to stop. I want to thank drugs.com for their information as I may not have associated this medication with the Zanex I was suppose to start today. Thanks, guys!",Stevie in Fiji
