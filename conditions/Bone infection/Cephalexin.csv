0,Cephalexin,Bone infection,,Taken for 5 to 10 years,"November 21, 2019",3,I contracted cervical osteomyelitis after a posterior cervical fusion in 2012. I have been on various Keflex dosages since.

1,Cephalexin,Bone infection,5.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"June 13, 2019",10,"I've been on Cephalexin for 5 months for a bone infection, and  I have another month to go.  I had a hip replacement, which became severely infected about a month later.  The side effects of this are horrible.I  get dry heaves at least 3 times per day, usually in an hour of taking it.  Sour stomach is also another huge side effect.  Extreme fatigue is another one.  Being on this medicine has destroyed my sleep cycle.  I wake up at 2-3 AM as I feel like I have to throw up, or my stomach just hurts.I started with intravenous injections through a PICC line for antibiotics, then it was changed to this green, nasty pill.Because of the sickness, that it creates, I have missed almost 6 months of work.  I try to get up in the morning, get ready for work, and end up dry heaving into the toilet.  4 months into the use of this antibiotic, my hair is starting to fall out as well.  This is a nasty medicine, but I do understand why it is needed.  I really do not want my hip hardware removed.",Rob
2,Cephalexin,Bone infection,10.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"February 16, 2019",8,"I had a very positive experience when I took Keflex for about 3-months. I was prescribed 3G/day and did not have any adverse side-effects at any point, and zero adverse side-effects after my Dr ended treatment with Keflex. Keflex was prescribed only after successful treatment w/Central-Line (PICC) with the Antibiotic, Cefazolin, for 6-weeks, to treat Osteomyelitis, Staph Present. I even had a improved complexion.",EricH
3,Cephalexin,Bone infection,2.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"November 13, 2018",5,2 weeks of 2000 mg per day cannot stop leg infection after right hip replacement. 34 days after surgery and I cannot bear weight on leg. Site still red and slightly inflamed. It has gone down in rough appearance but still too much pain to bear weight for long. Looking for disease specialist and new treatment.,Mikie3117
