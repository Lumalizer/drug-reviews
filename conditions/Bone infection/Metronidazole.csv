5,Metronidazole,Bone infection,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"January 15, 2016",2,"I had an infected dry socket following a tooth extraction.  TheDentist prescribed a 200mg tablet to be taken 3 times a day for 5 days for a dry socket. I had to discontinue the course after the 4th day because the latest reaction was a peculiar feeling in my legs as if I had run a marathon accompanied by feeling very wound up. Other reactions during the preceding days were varied and changed almost on a daily basis and included a metallic taste,sleeping more than usual, diarrhoea, loss of appetite, feeling queasy ( though I was feeling queasy with the infection before I started the medication) a painful flare up in my psoriasis, heavy head. Since stopping them 3 days ago, the metallic taste is still bothersome. I'm now having palpitations maybe unrelated! Tooth seems ok though.",Comfy slippers

My face was up like a balloon- these nasty tasting pills took swelling down in 8 hours and pain gone completely in 24hrs. Miracle pills for me. Dentist wanted to give me amoxicillin which I am allergic to as sensitve to most drugs. These pills make me tired a little, but in my health I have not felt this good for years- have a feeling they might be treating an underlying nasty such as a yeast infection that was making me feel rubbish. One up side of a tooth extraction.",Extraction Infection
