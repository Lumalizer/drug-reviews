0,Clindamycin,Bone infection,9,Taken for less than 1 month,"April 13, 2021",4,"I have been given Clindamycin for a severe jaw infection I didn't know I had. I originally thought my symptoms were possibly autoimmune, but it turns out it's a major infection in my lower jaw.  Anyway, Clindamycin is amazing! I'm starting my second round because of how bad the infection is, but I feel soooo much better. I can't believe you can be sick so long with a bone infection and not even know it. I didn't have many side effects. I take it with some crackers and a full + glass of water. You need to take probiotics about 2-3 hours before or after taking the medicine.  I even try to wait til 4 hours so the antibiotic doesn't get rid of the good bacteria your trying to replace. Everyone is different, but give it a try if your sitting on the fence about it. It's definitely worth it.",E.N.
1,Clindamycin,Bone infection,9,Taken for less than 1 month,"October 7, 2020",4,"I had a wisdom tooth pulled, but they did not send me home with antibiotics. 2 days later I broke a tooth and had to go back to get 2 more pulled. Still no antibiotics. By then my wisdom tooth site should have been on the up, however I noticed gunk inside it and immense amounts of pain. I called my dentist and asked for something other than pin. I received clindamycin 300 MG 4xs a day. It took about 48 hours to notice but it began to work. I've almost completed the course and have had only side effect, the taste in the mouth. I take the pill with lots of water and then have a snack pack of pudding or jello. I took it once before this and had the worst heart burn. I advise eating with it. It has been much better this go around.",mandy
2,Clindamycin,Bone infection,1,Taken for less than 1 month,"October 14, 2019",4,"I had Gum flap surgery about a month ago, was given Clindamycin after surgery, to ensure I did not get an infection in my mouth, or the bone structure of my gums, this medication made me so sick to the point I could not take the last three, also the side effects are horrific, the main one I am experiencing is severe dry mouth, now I have to take flagyl  to make sure I don't get an infection, also, it caused me to have thrush, so with that being said with everything else, Nystatin mouth rinse taste so bad, if you can avoid it, ask your doctor for something else...",Maria
3,Clindamycin,Bone infection,9,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"January 16, 2019",22,"CLINDAMYCIN WORKS, if taken correctly. To remedy the side effects from not only this antibiotic but really any antibiotic, first it is imperative to replenish the vital gut bacteria killed by antibiotics by eating probiotic packed foods. This will deter stomach aches, acid refux and usually will prevent diarrhea, however, if it still happens add lots of fiber-rich foods and leafy greens to one's diet. One must also have the not-so-common-now-a-days common-sense, when it comes to understanding instructions. If the bottle states ""take 3 times daily"" take it at the same exact time every 8 hours, this evenly spaces it providing continuous coverage. Lastly, take with food, unless instructed otherwise. If not able, milk alone provides similar stomach relief. I hope this helps someone out there!",Dr. Dopium
4,Clindamycin,Bone infection,10,Taken for less than 1 month,"December 25, 2018",12,"I had a tooth infection which spread into the bone and was making me ill. Dentist extracted the tooth and cleaned it up, put me on Clindamycin 150 mg every 6 hours for a week. I looked here first and was scared to take it - almost emailed him to ask for a different ATB but I tried it and it seems to be working! It didn't give me heartburn or diarrhea, I'm just tired but that could be the pain meds and healing.",acctgirl
5,Clindamycin,Bone infection,9,Taken for less than 1 month,"November 2, 2018",4,"When taking with a meal each time I've used it, over the last 6 days at 4 times a day I have noticed that the reddening around the area and the area itself has decreased substantially.  Also the soreness stopped within 8 hours completely. Also the epidermis layer has healed noticeably.  The side effects: mild itching,  mild skin peeling at the site,  diarrhea, and lowered noticeable blood pressure leading to mild light headedness. I am fortunate enough to be home while my husband works. In having my ongoing diabetes for 6 months untreated, and having some unhealed places, there's noticeable healing n 6 days time, and I am still taking it to complete it. Also the extreme neuropathy I had is diminishing daily. Also I am adding raw garlic cloves chopped up and taking with water,  thats been refrigerated daily with meals.I am extremely happy so far,  even with the side effects. And very grateful to the Dr.  That prescribed it.",Kristy
6,Clindamycin,Bone infection,9,,"June 4, 2017",4,"Often prescribed for patients with penn allergy with tooth and jaw infection. I found that the stomach pain makes me not want to take it. I find that eat half your meal, take the pill, then finish your food somehow helps reduce the pain and nausea. It Also helps cut down on the metal acid taste in your mouth. Drink a Danactive with each pill no matter what. Also...most important... get a script for zofran which is an anti emetic or anti barf pill. Helps tremendously. I take less than prescribed because I weigh less and it's  much easier on the gut and still very effective. I'm not advising you decrease doses unless you understand what your doing. Can cause more harm that's not worth the reduction in side effects.",Jaketg1
7,Clindamycin,Bone infection,9,Taken for less than 1 month,"February 12, 2017",19,"Had a raging toothache in a tooth that had a root canal several years prior.  Dentist thinks hidden canal may not have been cleared, but could also have been sinusitis, as the toothache coincided with bad head cold.  Anyway, I am allergic to most narcotic pain killers, so could only go with mega doses of ibuprofin to make tolerable and he prescribed clyndamycin for the infection, as I am also allergic to most penicillins.  300 mg 4x/day.  Started to feel pain relief after 7th-8th dose (i.e., 40 hours).  See lots of scary side effects here, but haven't had them yet myself.  Just take with meal and lost of water.  A little loose stool, but I'll take that over the tooth pain any day.",Sean J
8,Clindamycin,Bone infection,1,Taken for less than 1 month,"January 15, 2017",5,I was prescribed this for a tooth infection by day 2 I had to go the the hospital as the infection spread to my bones in my face. They gave me an IV dose in the emergency room and then had to go back for another at 11pm then again at 830am the next day. They hooked me up to an IV pump so I could have my 3 doses a day at home. Day 2 of IV and I have fever chills all of my joints ache and have major kidney pain. And the heartburn omg its so bad. Didn't think I would get the heartburn with an IV.  I have to say I'm not a fan of this medication. Only a few more days left of this hell I hope.  Still haven't eaten anything more than peanut butter since my mouth and face hurts so much.  Not a drug I would recommend,Tan83
9,Clindamycin,Bone infection,10,,"March 31, 2016",36,"I was put on Clindamycin for cellulitis, but the doctor missed the concurrent jawbone infection, so I was taken off of it too early (16 days).  It was doing a marvelous job on my jaw pain.  11 days of being off it allowed the bone infection to come back and spread painfully.  Finally, a dentist diagnosed the jaw infection that moved over from the sore throat and cellulitis (teeth fine), and my PCP put me back on Clindamycin.  After several days, the improvement has been steady.  I hope they treat me long enough to help fully clear up the bone infection this time.  Great stuff.Absolutely drink lots of water with it.  Helps a lot.  Food too.  Prayer too.",Ekim123

11,Clindamycin,Bone infection,9,Taken for less than 1 month,"March 2, 2015",29,"After what was supposed to be a filling, turned into a molar extraction, I ended up with dry socket. Around day 5 after the extraction I also ended up Osteomyltis starting in the same area as the extraction. I was than prescribed Clindamycin, as the infection was getting worse and the pain was excruciating from my jawbone to my ear and in the dry socket. The Clindamycin after 2 days of being on it, I could start feeling a difference. By the time I finished the prescription there were no ill effects and minimal permanent damage to my jaw.",Rikki Lei
12,Clindamycin,Bone infection,6,,"May 26, 2014",20,"I am currently taking 330 mg capsules after one of my dental implants failed to take and the doc thinks there is an infection.  I don't know that the medicine is helping that condition, there never has been any pain, swelling or drainage.  However, as many others, the ""heartburn"" is like I've never experienced.  I tolerate pain pretty well, but I was on the verge of tears when I climbed into bed one night.  I honestly thought it might be an oncoming heart attack.  I found taking an ibuprofen with the capsule headed off much of the bother.  Saw nothing listed in the side effects list that came with the medicine, but is frequently mentioned here.",Rocketman007
13,Clindamycin,Bone infection,9,,"September 15, 2013",50,"Taking clindamycin has been difficult for me. It's caused nausea, diarrhea, and stomach pain. But it's also been the only thing to clear up my jaw bone infection. They gave me 2 other types of antibiotics before this and neither helped. If you can endure the unpleasant side effects, it's a good medicine for it.",Annefl
14,Clindamycin,Bone infection,10,Taken for less than 1 month,"July 23, 2013",33,"If it weren't for clindamycin. I would not know what to do, it is a life saver from all the pain or unbearable comfort. I am reading the reviews, but it seems like people forget to suggest to drink lots of water; I always remember to drink lots of water with antibiotics because if you do not, you will feel like your insides are getting parched, and I think that is from the medicine. Sometimes I get occasional runny stomach, but not bad enough to where I had to stop because if it is constant you will have to tell the doctor and stop the pills, but I recommend this to anyone.",Muoshoo
