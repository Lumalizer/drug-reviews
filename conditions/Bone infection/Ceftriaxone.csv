0,Ceftriaxone,Bone infection,6,Taken for less than 1 month,"August 14, 2018",1,"Rocephin (ceftriaxone):Went to urgent care for a bad case of pharyngitis. Previously, I was on amoxicillin for ten days which seemed to help but the infection came back. The doctor ordered blood work and a gram of IV Rocephin. The Rocephin was pushed for 30 minutes and it hurt a bit going in. I was put on oral Axetil for another ten days. It’s been four days since the IV and the injection site is tender, and I have a huge red bruise that wraps around and extends to the elbow. The throat feels better — my arm, not so much.",Nino
