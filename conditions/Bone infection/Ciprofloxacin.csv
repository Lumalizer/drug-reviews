0,Ciprofloxacin,Bone infection,8,Taken for 5 to 10 years,"January 4, 2021",2,Cipro (ciprofloxacin):This drug is a blessing and a curse. I've had repeated bouts of osteomyelitis having been on cipro for months at a time. Not mention seven surgeries and one amputation to resolve the infections. Cipro got rid the infection but did cause three of my teeth to become brittle and break. So please use caution when using this medication,Lindy
