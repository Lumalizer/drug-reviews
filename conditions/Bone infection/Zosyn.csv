0,Zosyn,Bone infection,10,,"July 31, 2019",7,"I took this medicine  periodically for a bone infection with foul odor  that I've had for 3 years now .  I usually use it for 6 weeks and it clear the infection for about 1 year, but now is my fourth time and it doesn't seem to be working anymore for me.  The last time was the first time I every had any reaction or side effects.  I always had yeast infections but that's common with any antibiotic, my palm started peeling profusely, I started itching uncontrollably, and red bruises on my left leg.  So now I must find a new medication because I believe my body is rejecting the medicine now.",Anonymous
