0,Unasyn,Bone infection,9,,"February 21, 2016",7,I'm taking this by IV for osteomyelitis in my jaw. I have 2 more weeks left but so far so good. No issues. Something strange I've noticed that's amazing is my face is very clear. No blackheads gunked up on my nose or chin. It's a wonderful time to allow time for my skin to heal and be clean! Does anyone know why this med clears up acne?,SeeFlapFlap
