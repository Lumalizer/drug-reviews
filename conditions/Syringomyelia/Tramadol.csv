0,Tramadol,Syringomyelia,,,"December 22, 2020",1,My syrinx is from T-2 thru T-11. It is extremely painful but I receive no pain medication. The doctors tell me that Lyrica is a pain pill. I wish they had my back. I canâ€™t get pain pills to help. Every doctor is afraid to prescribe narcotics for fear of getting in trouble.,Navy Guy
1,Tramadol,Syringomyelia,5.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"March 29, 2018",6,"I have syringomyelia. My syrinx runs from T4 to T11. I am on the max dose of Tramadol. I have take this medication in extended release 200mg and 2 50mg for the break through pain. It knocks the edge off but that's about it. My neurologist said if the pain continues, I will likely end up with pain pump installed. They seem to like this approach, because it administers morphine directly into the spinal canal. I wish that this medication worked, I do not want opiates.",Mountaintop
