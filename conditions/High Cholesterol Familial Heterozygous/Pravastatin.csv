0,Pravastatin,High Cholesterol Familial Heterozygous,1,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"September 12, 2020",36,"Was prescribed Pravastatin 80mg for genetically high cholesterol and had to cut it back myself to 40 mg after 4.25 months because getting side effects of non-diabetic neuropathy, odd cramps in hands and legs, overall weakness, could not think straight, could not put simple words together, could not remember complete sentences, hair falling out, muscle pain especially in r-bicep, shakiness especially in arms and hands and more. Finally, since my doctor would not allow me a visit (COVID), I quit Pravastatin altogether on 8/18/20. It is now 9/12/20 and I still feel horrible, but my memory is coming back. How can it be legal to sell this medicine? How cruel to do this to people! How many, I wonder, get misdiagnosed with dementia, when really it is the statins. I am crying right now for others on this drug.  Also Pravastatin depleted and somehow continues to deplete my potassium, even after I quit taking Pravastatin. That is possibly why I continue to feel very weak?Shame on all involved!",Anonymous
1,Pravastatin,High Cholesterol Familial Heterozygous,1,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"September 6, 2020",14,"(I have genetically high cholesterol, I am NOT overweight.) Was on 40 mg Simvastatin several years. My new Dr decided to experiment on me, but who cares, because I am 70. He switched me to 40 mg Atorvastatin for about 18 days of all sorts of side BAD effects. (Atorvastatin must be the worst medicine on Earth!) So he decided to take me off 40 mg Atorvastatin for 20 days. Then he got the bright idea, (and without doing a blood test), to switch me to 80 mg Pravastatin. Pravastatin side effects took longer to kick in, (I was on it about 4 -1/2 mo). I got so sick with just about every BAD side effect including losing my hair. I have been off all statins for about 2 weeks and still feel horrible. Hope to feel better someday soon.",Anonymous
