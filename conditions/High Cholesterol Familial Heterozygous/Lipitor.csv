1,Lipitor,High Cholesterol Familial Heterozygous,5.0,Taken for 10 years or more,"February 23, 2021",15,I have hereditary high cholesterol and have taken statins on and off since I was 15 years old. My overall cholesterol at age 15 was 370. It has ran as high as 460 when I wasn't taking a statin (usually Lipitor). Problem is my bowels stay messed up. I stay constipated all the time and I suffer from anal leakage which is highly embarrassing and I feel like I'm constantly thinking I may smell bad. I keep baby wipes to try to keep myself clean without talking 3 showers a day. Do all statins cause this? I'm finding it harder and harder to accept and feel like just quitting statins all together. I know that sounds foolish but so does anal leakage.,Bamaboy
