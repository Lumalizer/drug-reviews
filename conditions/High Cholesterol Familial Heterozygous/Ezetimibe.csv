0,Ezetimibe,High Cholesterol Familial Heterozygous,9.0,,"December 31, 2021",0,"My cholesterol ran high, then spiked to 350 despite strict diet. Started statins they helped but not enough.  Started Ezetimibe and cholesterol down in 150s after 6 weeks.  My body aches terribly at times, my hands and hips are the worst- but thatâ€™s from the statins.  Probably got a little worse with adding this drug.   However, I already have a 70% blockage so I am sticking with it.  I also had loose stool issues with starting Ezetimibe, for about 4 weeks, but that has greatly improved.",Ren
1,Ezetimibe,High Cholesterol Familial Heterozygous,1.0,,"August 6, 2021",2,"Doctor prescribed 10 mg of ezetimibe (Zetia), 1 dose a day.  After 1 mo was feeling tired, with sore muscles. I thought I was working out too much, walking yoga, jazzercise, jogging, so I slowed downed.  By 6th wk, the muscle pain and weakness was so bad I could barely lift my arms, I was extremely tired, the muscle and joint pain from my chest up is excruciating!  It's in my jaw, neck, shoulders, arms, chest, and hands.  I've been off the drug for just over a month and now the muscle pain and weakness is moving down to my  hips and legs. Blood work showed severe liver and muscle damage.  Extreme high CK 1182 even after being off the drug for a month.  I was an active, fully functional middle-aged female, now I feel like a 90 year old with RA!  5 years ago was on a statin.  I ended up in the hospital with a stroke.  Took 6 mo to get statin out of body. Cardiologist and neuro said I had no cardio problems and it was the statin that caused the stroke and TIAs. Cholesterol drugs are bad for you",Suffering

3,Ezetimibe,High Cholesterol Familial Heterozygous,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"November 7, 2020",7,"I took Ezetimiba for 3 days and felt dizzy and sick with headaches. I had a dry mouth and it felt like I had a lump in my throat when swallowing. I left it for a couple of weeks thinking I would try again when they were 'out of my system'. Two weeks later after doing a walk (which I usually do most days) which involved steps, I had so much pain in my thigh muscles I could hardly walk the next day.I tried two more tablets after that, this time taking them at bedtime, but had, and are still having two weeks later, muscle pains and weird dreams. I woke up screaming one night after a nightmare.",Wixsey
4,Ezetimibe,High Cholesterol Familial Heterozygous,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"September 20, 2020",16,"Hey guys. I'm 26 years old, have severe familial hypercholesterolemia. Was on ezetimibe for only 4 days in addition to crestor 40mg. Urine became brown, had horrible fatigue and pain in my legs and feet, plus blocked nose. Have stopped taking it even though the benefit of this drug (in addition to statins) apparently outweighs the importance of my quality of life. Also dark urine suggests liver or kidney problems and I could tell the small amount of symptoms I had was only getting worse by the day. Will continue to search for an answer to my problem.",Hels

8,Ezetimibe,High Cholesterol Familial Heterozygous,9.0,Taken for 10 years or more,"December 5, 2016",48,"Zetia (ezetimibe):I have been taking Zetia off and on since it first came out in 2002. But now the price has gotten prohibitive. There is no generic for it, because Merck is greedy and still holds the patent. There has been a generic drug available since 2015, but Merck wants to be the sole source for this drug, and it's has not been allowed on the market. I've paid a co-pay of $25 per month due to a secondary card I got from my doctor's office, now my insurance has jacked the co-pay to $100 for 30 tabs. I went to the Merck site and they no longer offer a discount card. They have a form for applying for a free prescription online, but apparently you must be destitute to get it. Since they're the only guy in town for this drug, this is just ridiculous...",Mrywidow
9,Ezetimibe,High Cholesterol Familial Heterozygous,10.0,Taken for 10 years or more,"March 29, 2016",55,Zetia (ezetimibe):I have been on Zetia for a number of years.   The retail price has now gone over the  one thousand dollar amount for a three month suppy.  $12 for each tiny capsule.  What is the deal.  My dr. has recently told me to take one every other day to cut the cost.   I am on social security and have a good RX policy....but it still costs me over $5.50 in cash.  That is prohibitive for a drug that has been on the market for years and years.  I think the makers of it are out of their minds.   My last refill the retail was $899.  Please tell  WHY has it gone up almost $200.,KT  I have been on Zetia for a
