1,Zetia,High Cholesterol Familial Heterozygous,9.0,Taken for 10 years or more,"December 5, 2016",48,"I have been taking Zetia off and on since it first came out in 2002. But now the price has gotten prohibitive. There is no generic for it, because Merck is greedy and still holds the patent. There has been a generic drug available since 2015, but Merck wants to be the sole source for this drug, and it's has not been allowed on the market. I've paid a co-pay of $25 per month due to a secondary card I got from my doctor's office, now my insurance has jacked the co-pay to $100 for 30 tabs.

Since they're the only guy in town for this drug, this is just ridiculous...",Mrywidow

That is prohibitive for a drug that has been on the market for years and years.  I think the makers of it are out of their minds.   My last refill the retail was $899.  Please tell  WHY has it gone up almost $200.,KT  I have been on Zetia for a
