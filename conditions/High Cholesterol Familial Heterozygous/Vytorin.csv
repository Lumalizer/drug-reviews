My cholesterol was 460 to 480 and that was with 80mg of Zocor.  After Vytorin, my cholesterol went down to the 170 range, my Good / bad cholesterol ratio went from about 4 or 5 to 1 (really) to the 1 to 1 range.  I have actually had testes where my good was matched with my bad.Yea!  Good stuff",Anonymous
