1,Repatha,High Cholesterol Familial Heterozygous,1.0,,"August 22, 2021",2,"I am a 66 year old male with familial high cholesterol & triglycerides. I have been unable to take statins & other meds for lowering cholesterol due to elevation of muscle enzymes which causes muscle pain & weakness. After a stent, the Dr wanted me to take Repatha. I took it 5 months & due to other health issues I did not realize I was having issues until a heart cath came back normal. I had chest pressure, shortness of breath with minor exertion, sweating very easily, body aches, fatigue, back pain & muscle aches all over. My muscle enzymes test which I had to request was very elevated. I immediately stopped Repatha. Chest discomfort stopped immediately, breathing is better & sweating stopped but still having severe back, muscle aches in legs & legs feeling very rubbery. My advice is to pay very close attention to muscle aches if you take this medication & have problems with other cholesterol medications.",Papa Bear
2,Repatha,High Cholesterol Familial Heterozygous,2.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"May 7, 2021",16,"I began taking twice-monthly Repatha in November 2020 on the advice of my cardiologist. I am a healthy and active 68-year-old female with familial hypercholesterolemia. Previously, I had tried four different statins and various doses, all of which resulted in considerable muscle pain and night cramps. Things seemed fine until my third Repatha injection when I began having severe pain in my right arm and shoulder. I didn't link  the pain to this so continued taking my injections, eight altogether, until my final dose at the end of February. By then, I was experiencing increasingly severe pain in both shoulders and arms, weak leg muscles making it difficult to stand, dizziness and fatigue. Although Repatha dropped my LDL from 177 to 68, the side effects are debilitating. I am done with Repatha and statins. I stopped taking Repatha in late February but two months later the side effects continue to wax and wane. I am praying my system can recover and my life return to normal.",Terese
3,Repatha,High Cholesterol Familial Heterozygous,1.0,,"April 22, 2021",8,"It has been 6 months since I took one injection of repatha.  I still experience flare-ups of muscle and joint pain, as well as muscle weakness and fatigue.  I am a 65-year-old woman, of smaller stature.  My CRP was over 3 times normal after the one injection, gradually reducing to normal over many months.  This medication can cause side effects which last a very long time and greatly affect quality of life.  Beware!",Jen
4,Repatha,High Cholesterol Familial Heterozygous,1.0,,"April 1, 2021",7,"My personal experience has been horrible. Allergic to statins.  Well after about 4 injection. I became seriously ill, difficult to even lift my body up or do any daily activities without fatigue.  I took the injection Wednesday and by Friday I was convinced I had the flu.  Even had a low grade fever.  I am 50 years old and was quite previously active bf healthy. I honestly feel like my bones became brittle muscular weakness and pain. Can barely lift arms. Also have gi issues now. I took all the covid flu and strep and urine test and all were good.  I feel like walking death. This is not quality of life.  Also as read above which I now find out that it takes a long time to get out of the system and has an accumulative effect.  Which is why I didn’t connect this med with my symptoms cause initially all was going fine.  I will take homeopathic natural medicine given by my Accupuncturist.  Do NOT take this stuff. I’m so sick now and it’s been a week since I took this stuff.",Jean
5,Repatha,High Cholesterol Familial Heterozygous,5.0,,"February 10, 2021",4,"Honestly, I feel like it did permanent damage to my nerves. I started with Repatha and after 2 months of being on the injection, I started to get burning in my feet and a little in my hands. I went to the doctor (and of course he didn't think it was from the injection) and had me stop taking it and see a neurologist. They did an EMG and I had an MRI of my brain. They found nothing. The sensation went away after a month. So I restarted it again and it came back, then stopped it for awhile. We tried doing the injection every 3 weeks and eventually the burning came back. So he moved me to the other shot Pradulent. With that I felt it literally effecting my legs, like restless syndrome. So I said no more and I haven't been on for over 6 months. Well now I still get the burning in my feet and a little in my hands that come and go. So I'm kind of upset about that. Going to the neurologist again. I really hope this medication didn't cause permanent damage because I'll be so annoyed.",Not a bot 80

I was extremely active and athletic till Repatha. This drug has made weak, sick, inflamed, and unable to stay active as before. Even after a year and half, I continue to stuffer from side affects.

8,Repatha,High Cholesterol Familial Heterozygous,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"November 4, 2020",59,Add my voice to those who have experienced horrible side effects from Repatha.  After one injection - terrible muscle and joint pain all over my body - much worse than the three statins I tried previously.  I will never touch this medicine again.  Diet modification and exercise are the only treatments I will try ever again.,Joe
9,Repatha,High Cholesterol Familial Heterozygous,10.0,Taken for 5 to 10 years,"October 7, 2020",18,"I was in the initial investigational group (lab rat) which started 5 to 7 years ago for this drug and just left in February 2020.  I was included in the study because of stroke at 49 and heart attack at 51 plus heart attacks and strokes have been the cause of death for family members.  Honestly with cholesterol at 500 I had little hope anything would reduce it.  The statins hurt me with side effects so Repatha was worth a try.    One of my other physicians accidentally gave me my blood work and I was shocked to discover after only a few months my cholesterol and all lipids were reduced to normal levels.  In particular, my cholesterol was now around 100.I left the study group in February 2020 and had a series of TIAs beginning in August 2020.  I asked to be put back on the drug and am currently on it.  I am pleased with the results.",Just me

As a result I have developed chronic sinus infections, flu, shortness of breath, pain in my lungs, stomach pain, and most recently fevers, ear pressure, dizziness, and severe headaches. I suspected the medication was causing my problems over a year ago. I spoke with a nurse from Amegen who played it down and so did my doctor. I was referred to an allergist who after a full pulmonary function test, allergy test, and x-ray CT and CT scan of lungs concluded I have non allergic rhinitis. I was constantly prescribed antibiotics and steroids for the symptoms. Sometimes they worked and many times they didn't. I have seen an Infectious disease doctor, a hematologist, ENT and a pulmonologist. All who cannot determine why I am suffering. I have an FMLA for intermittent leave because sometimes I can't get out of the bed. I took my last injection last Saturday the day the headaches started and I have had every day since.

Started ramipril a few weeks after having two lad stents in January but it took a long time for repatha approval so have had just two injections.  I also have chronic migraine which was improving with Aimovig.  Since starting repatha I have had daily migraine and was having middle of the night coughing.  Also very dizzy on awakening now and any bending over.  Also was very nauseated.  I stopped ramipril a few days ago and cough and nausea stopped but not headaches or dizziness.  I do not have high blood pressure or diabetes and am 61.  Cannot stand a daily migraine, I don’t think I can take repatha.",piglet

I have four stents along with torn tendons and connective tissue disease that can’t be explained.Frequent urination and problems. Neck,leg,and back pain do not allow me to sleep. Severe headaches, but the newest side effects are very scary to me...stomach cramps, diarrhea, and vomiting for days after the injection, which I am sure will be my last. I am saddened after reading the reviews that this will last for quite sometime. Only 55 feeling hopeless and feeling like a 90 years old everyday is not the quality of life I was trying to accomplish.  I hope there is help on its way. Thank you for the truths.

My mouth ,tongue ,lips , & gums were starting to blister & burn with my throat & esophagus was on fire. I was short of breath & having palpitations. I had lots of tests & labs . I received IV Solumedrol & respiratory treatments. I was sent home on 15 days of high dose Prednisone.  I’m in the tapering period of the Prednisone & still bad. Severe sore throat, weakness, & palpitations . The cardiologist did labs for electrolytes because I’m having symptoms of low potassium.  I was told by the specialty pharmacist  that dispensed Repatha the adverse effects could  last for months because it could be in my system for a while .   I regret taking this drug. I had reservations about it after researching it & reading the patient reviews. Lesson learned. Follow your gut feelings.",Anonymous

Unable to tolerate statins including zetial.  Statins messed with my liver enzymes and I had severe liver pain while on them.

BTW, I have a terrible back with spinal, join and disc issues and disease and I have found no pain other than my normal daily pain with the 2 Repatha shots I had. Wish me luck.

21,Repatha,High Cholesterol Familial Heterozygous,5.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"October 7, 2019",40,"I was leery about starting a drug that hasn't been on the market that long and also my distrust for pharmaceutical companies. Repatha worked and brought down my LDL but there is a cost. In the beginning, I'd just have cold symptoms and some fatigue which only last a few days but with time I would eventually develop more side effects that lasted longer such as PVCs, and now I get burning in my feet, hands and through out my body. Dr. said I may have neuropathy but when tested at the time it showed no damage. I'd stop Repatha for 2 months and everything was settle down but my fear of having a heart attack would cause me to try it again. Have taken 2 more shots and now the burning is back and I had flu-like symptoms that has caused me to stop exercising and miss some days of work too. Idk what I'm going to do but I don't want to live my life suffering like this. I also don't like when doctors don't want to put the blame on the medication that they know nothing about.",Nonick

25,Repatha,High Cholesterol Familial Heterozygous,3.0,,"August 12, 2019",37,I have several in my family with high cholesterol...503 high so hereditary.  I went on Repatha in Oct. 2018.  My numbers steadily went down to 235 with mild side effects; some joint pain every now and then. This all changed with my July 2019 injection.  I experienced sudden severe hip pain that went all the way down one leg.  I could not walk even to the next room.  I have had sciatica before and this was a lot like that except that it lasted for a day and a half and went away.   I wrote this sudden pain  off as maybe it was sciatica until my next injection and the same thing happened but less severe.  I immediately went off of the Repatha. I'm still experiencing more symptoms like muscle weakness and throbbing pain in my arm and hand joints. My feet ache often now as well.  I had tried several statins as well and those also resulted in several side effects that were not tolerable.,Lou

I am 71 and was getting ready for a 3 month walking vacation in Europe so I wanted to be able to walk several miles a day. I have been completely off Repatha since the first week in January and am still having extreme pain in my thighs (injection points) with loss of energy and muscle pains throughout my body. I feel like I'm walking on a tennis ball in my left arch and have stabbing knife pains in my right leg. They have really not dissipated since January and it is now the middle of June.  I am livid that my doctor talked me into this because I couldn't do statins and did so much research on cholesterol that I know how ridiculous it is to be forced to take this garbage.

I did not want to stop the repatha because of the amazing cholesterol numbers, but I didn't have a choice. I could not live with the pain. I have been off of repatha for 6 months now. The neck pain has gotten somewhat better. My left arm is still pretty painful. I had gotten to the point I could hardly use it. It maybe a little better now. I sometimes have to pick up my left arm with my right arm to move it. I gave a 2 bar rating because repatha does lower your cholesterol to perfect.

Mild Plaque burden in one area seen grew to 3 areas. I tried almost every statin on the market. I could NOT tolerate statins. Between muscle aches, joint pain, muddled thought, energy issues. When running to Google my symptoms online, I realized thousands of people were experiencing the exact same. I was convinced all these odd symptoms were from the statins. I was off and on 4x and subsequently stopped. Note: best blood results were Lipitor but still MANY unbearable side effects! I ride a bike. I'm athletic. I'm physically fit my entire life.
