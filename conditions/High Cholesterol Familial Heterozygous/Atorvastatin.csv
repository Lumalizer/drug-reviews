0,Atorvastatin,High Cholesterol Familial Heterozygous,1.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"October 19, 2021",2,"I was put on avorastatin for high cholesterol (300) genetic history.  I asked no questions.  Always accept that side effects are a given and diminish as my body adjusts.  Started to feel muscle aches in hips, shoulders, thighs. My knees ached.  I’m a runner and I felt horrible during and after runs.  I had no idea why this was occurring.  It dawned on me that these symptoms started when I went on the statin. Come to find out these are common side effects.  It’s like I have the flu constantly.  So my advice is don’t take this drug.  Sorry. I wish I could offer a positive story.",Mark
1,Atorvastatin,High Cholesterol Familial Heterozygous,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"August 20, 2021",1,"This scrambled my memory as if I had Dementia but I am recovering now that I am off Atorvastatin for 8 months. Did not lower my cholesterol. Made me unable to stand up, actually collapsed outside in public. Horrible drug. Now lowering my cholesterol by special diet. (Was never overweight, had genetically high cholesterol.)",JBW
2,Atorvastatin,High Cholesterol Familial Heterozygous,10.0,Taken for 10 years or more,"August 3, 2021",0,Lipitor (atorvastatin):Have been using it for over 10 years.  No problems at a dose of 10mg.  Works well when combined with Ezetrol,akex
3,Atorvastatin,High Cholesterol Familial Heterozygous,5.0,Taken for 10 years or more,"February 23, 2021",15,Lipitor (atorvastatin):I have hereditary high cholesterol and have taken statins on and off since I was 15 years old. My overall cholesterol at age 15 was 370. It has ran as high as 460 when I wasn't taking a statin (usually Lipitor). Problem is my bowels stay messed up. I stay constipated all the time and I suffer from anal leakage which is highly embarrassing and I feel like I'm constantly thinking I may smell bad. I keep baby wipes to try to keep myself clean without talking 3 showers a day. Do all statins cause this? I'm finding it harder and harder to accept and feel like just quitting statins all together. I know that sounds foolish but so does anal leakage.,Bamaboy
4,Atorvastatin,High Cholesterol Familial Heterozygous,2.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"March 12, 2020",16,"Side effects from atorvastatin meant that I stopped taking it : tendinitis in hands and ankles, muscle weakness that was debilitating. It gets better later  in the day but early morning is difficult.  I have high familial cholesterol about 8 (reduced via statins from 10) but the 40mg dose hasn't reduced it further and the side effects are dire for me: doc says other treatments are available but it will take 3 months to clear.",Robinjr2
5,Atorvastatin,High Cholesterol Familial Heterozygous,2.0,,"May 3, 2017",26,"This drug does lower cholesterol levels. My high levels are genetic and I have stents from a heart attack at age 64. I'm 68 now and changing my diet has helped me feel better and lose weight, but I just can't take Lipitor for my higher than normal levels. The problem is the side affects. I suffer with allergies which cause me to cough and sneeze. I also have previously suffered with colitis which still acts up. I've been told that the drug is not related, but I've tried it for periods of about 3 to 5 months to get cholesterol levels in check. It works, but every time I take it I feel listless and depressed. Worst of all when I sneeze or cough from allergies I suffer anal leakage. When I stop it, I'm okay. It's just not worth it.",Mookie Wilson
