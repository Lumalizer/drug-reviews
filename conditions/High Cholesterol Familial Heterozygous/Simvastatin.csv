0,Simvastatin,High Cholesterol Familial Heterozygous,8,,"October 17, 2011",19,"Started on simvastatin about a year ago and 6 weeks into taking the medicine, my LDL was down about 40 points.  About a month ago, the pharmacy switched generics (prescription came with a heads up that the color and shape of pill might be different). Now suddenly, I'm suffering from a swollen tongue and numbness of tongue and upper pallet.  Not sure if this is due to the new generic (pharmacist says only the filler and dye would have changed)...but it's gotten so annoying that I went to doctor today for blood tests.",Anonymous
