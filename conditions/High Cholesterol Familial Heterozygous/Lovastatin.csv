2,Lovastatin,High Cholesterol Familial Heterozygous,9,,"August 13, 2008",53,"Mevacor (lovastatin):I have been on lovastatin for many years. I started with Mevacor and then tried later statins, but seemed to experience minor muscle aches from the newer ones and I requested to stay on lovastatin. ",tyler57
3,Lovastatin,High Cholesterol Familial Heterozygous,9,,"May 5, 2008",55,"Altoprev (lovastatin):Altoprev is the ONLY statin drug I can tolerate. It is due to the timed-release of the drug over 24 hours. I do not recieve that whopping dose of the drug all at once. However, my ins. Rx. coverage wil not cover it. I do not get to take it regularly, due to fixed income. It is 160.00 a month. But this is the drug for me and I get it filled about every other month.",misspapaw
