1,Praluent,High Cholesterol Familial Heterozygous,5.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"January 24, 2022",0,"I started taking Praluent 75mg in March of 2020. It immediately gave me best cholesterol numbers of my life. Cardio wanted LDL even lower so he put me on 150mg every 2 weeks. For one year I took this dose with small side effects. It definitely agitated my sinuses and I used to get phantom smells which could be sinuses.  Fast forward to February 2021, I get my first Pfizer Covid Vaccination and developed severe itching of the hands starting 3 days after Praluent injection lasting 3-4 days. Over the few months it got worse so we went back to 75mg. Itching stopped for a couple of months then it started doing it again on the 75 mg. By August 2021 I was itching from 3 days after injection to 1 day prior to the next injection 2 weeks later. I stopped the med in August 21. My numbers went through the roof. My LDL was higher than it had ever been. I believe there is a REBOUND effect when you stop this med. Can't take statins. Repatha gave me Gastritis. So I'm back trying to get on Praluent again",Brian
2,Praluent,High Cholesterol Familial Heterozygous,5.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"October 31, 2021",0,"75 ml praluent injections since August reduced from 240 to 144mg/dl.  The FDA approved it for use in hypercholesterolemia patients in April 2021.  Then I helped lift a heavy furniture box with my son, stood on a tall ladder, and days later developed intractable pain in my lower back radiating to my left leg, which is common in an injury that pinches the sciatic nerve (""sciatica"").Normally, an NSAID pain reliever would have provided relief, but I just underwent TAVR in early August (and started taking Praluent before that, and Eliquis several years before the surgery was needed), I could not take the NSAID drug I usually took.  The pain escalated and my GP prescribed prednisone, which helped with what was becoming two new rotator cuff injuries on my arms from using a cane instead of a walker or wheelchair.  But the prednisone did nothing for the back pain, and by the way, is also incompatible with Praluent, which I have discontinued for now.",Praluent & Pain

4,Praluent,High Cholesterol Familial Heterozygous,1.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"September 6, 2021",0,"After one year on Praulent (75 mg every two weeks) with no noticeable side effects, I began to notice the last week of month 13 that I wasn't recovering from workouts as quickly as normal and I experienced a huge loss of stamina with outdoor activities such as kayaking. I persisted with Praulent as my cardiologist had told me that I would have to take it the rest of my life. I went kayaking the first of August. Afterward, I barely got my kayak up into the the bed of my truck and got home I felt so weak. I was severely fatigued for two days. I tried one more injection (fool, right?) and the symptoms increased. They were feeling like I had a constant flu, body aches and pains, tingling and sharp pains in shoulder joints, difficulty standing and walking. I discontinued Praulent, with the approval of the primary physician. I wake up in pain now, though it has begun to lessen each morning. I presently have to place a step stool to get in my truck. I hope this gets out of my system soon.",62i
5,Praluent,High Cholesterol Familial Heterozygous,1.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"August 16, 2021",0,"After almost 35 years of taking statins, I can no longer tolerate the joint and muscle pain. I used Praluent 75 mg for 2 months, but my numbers did not come down to acceptable levels. I have taken 3 injections of 150 mg and noticed the following: 1 week after 1st dose, I started to experience muscle twitches that went away after a few days.  I would also wake up with my heart racing; which I thought was weird since I hadn’t gotten out of bed yet. One week after the second dose, I went to the ER with something that felt like muscle spasms in my heart (diagnosed premature atrial contractions). It lasted several hours, but went away. 3 days after my third dose, I woke up with heart palpitations that are still going at 3:00pm, which is where I am now. After reading that others have had severe palpitations, I will discuss discontinuing with my doctor and either stop or reduce my dosage.",Christina

Statins wrecked my body up until this came out. I’m allergic to almost everything so I was happy to hear that this medicine didn’t have bad side effects for most people. This medicine has literally saved my life. Ive had normal levels for a while now. The only noticeable thing I get is occasional urinary sensitivity. Surprised to see all the negative comments.

I started on Praluent just after Christmas 2019 and continued  every 2 weekly shots through August 2020. My body will not tolerate Statin drugs, so this was my only option to try and control my Cholesterol. In December of 2019, my Total cholesterol was 286 after 8 months of using Praluent my cholesterol only went down by 2 point to 284. My Triglycerides went up by 50 points, 108 in December to 158 in august. HDL (good cholesterol) went down by 3 points, 50 in December to 47 in August. Finally, my LDL went down by 9 points, 214 in December to 205 in August. In summation, Praluent did not work for me. Hopefully, I have better results on Repatha. From a side effect point of view, I would take the injection on a Thursday and by Saturday afternoon I would be bothered with a headache. Usually by Sunday night the headache would resolve, I would be fine until my next dose.",Coach K

Then the muscle pains and fatigue would set in until time for the next shot. Rinse and repeat. However, my cardiologist was ecstatic with my blood work. I had been on the injections for a couple of months when I got a real bad case of pneumonia and could do nothing but lay in bed and cough phlegm for 3 weeks. I went off the injections during this time. After 4 weeks of no injections I got blood work done and it was absolutely horrible, so now of course I'm back on it just praying the muscle pain goes away and that I don't get pneumonia again.

Praluent was okay regarding neuralgia for the first few months when I was yanking out the needle at the halfway point (due to a bad reaction to Repatha in 2018...another story for another day). 8 weeks ago when I started leaving the needle in until it retracted, i.e., giving myself the full 75 mg, that's when my neuralgia started to break through intensely.  Very disappointing.  I hope that, going back to the half dose, even though it's very hard to estimate when to pull out the needle --  the needle is so fast, I hope to reverse the increased neuralgia.

I feel better if I take Norco or Tramadol which I use for back pain, but on advice of my cardiologist I skipped the last Praluent dose to see if I feel any better.  Praluent has a half-life of 17-20 days so I figure I'll need to wait at least 40 days to see if I feel better.  I sure hope the Praluent is not the cause because it's keeping me alive.  I'm 66 and my father died at age 57 from a heart attack.  For me the only solution might be to increase my pain meds.

It is very expensive though hope price is reduced soon im lucky to be getting help from the Patient Access Network.i worry about this help being stopped in the future which will cause me to stop taking it and having to go back to the medications I used to take which did nothing for me,Dennis a2z
46,Praluent,High Cholesterol Familial Heterozygous,8.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"September 11, 2015",54,"Gave myself the first injection using the Pen earlier this week.  The injection was automatic. Pressed it against my skin, pushed the button, the mechanism clicked and the injection was made.  When finished the mechanism clicked again which withdrew the needle. It was almost painless. Will repeat in two weeks and get blood tests in a few months to see if it works.",Don W
