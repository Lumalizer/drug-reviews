0,Erythromycin,Dental Abscess,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"February 17, 2022",0,"After three courses of Amoxycillin over eight months which didn't fix the abscess (and nor did the root canal treatment), I asked my dentist to prescribe Erythromycin while waiting for the tooth to be extracted. Having experienced side effects from Erythromycin last time I had it 17 years ago, I steeled myself for them again. Day four of taking them and so far, all good. My usual IBS related diarrhea has actually reversed since taking these antibiotics and far from nausea, I'm permanently ravenously hungry. Sleeping better than I have in months and no dizziness or confusion so far. The best thing of all, for the first time in months I don't have excruciating pain from the tooth and jaw. So don't be put off by the negative reviews on here, not everyone experiences the problems with Erythromycin - mine are described as gastro-resistant, so maybe that's why they've been absolutely fine",JCB

2,Erythromycin,Dental Abscess,2.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"May 1, 2021",10,"For tooth infection I was prescribed 2 erythromycin x 250mg pill 4 x per day for 7 days. Altogether 56 pills.Now after 1 day, I didn’t sleep all night because of stomach cramps, diarrhea, almost vomited 3 times and I feel very very sick. My tooth pain is better but I never felt like this. There are definitely better option for people allergic to penicillin as I know that I took some antibiotics before and felt normal.I will see in few hours if situation is any better as I am due to take another dose. Might go with 50%",Hele
3,Erythromycin,Dental Abscess,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"April 8, 2021",2,I had a ossible infection on bottom right teeth so was given a dose of 2 tabs 4 x a day. Took for 2 days during which time had bad stomach pain and feeling sick. 3rd day a lot of cramping pain and vomiting. Woke up this morning with stomach pain. Now bringing up small amounts of sick. Never want these tabs again.,Peanut
4,Erythromycin,Dental Abscess,8.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"December 31, 2020",5,"As someone else said, it takes a while to beat the infection and, as a result, takes a bit longer to reduce swelling and pain but after roughly 2.5 days. It looks like things are getting much better.  I was taking 200 mg of ibuprofen every 6 hours for the pain/swelling but this next one might be my last one.  So hang in there and do NOT stop taking the course (usually 7-10 days).  You risk promoting resistant bacterial growth.  I have had minor stomach issues due to it (diarrhea one day) but always made sure I took it after a meal to reduce these side effects.  I’d much rather have a day or two of mild diarrhea than intense tooth pain.",Shander
5,Erythromycin,Dental Abscess,6.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"December 6, 2020",1,"erythromycin used to work fine for me when I had a dental abscess,  but this time I left it too long, and it reduced the pain, but it came back. I think you have to treat the abscess early for it to work properly. I can't have penicillin. Gave a bit of acid reflux.",paul

10,Erythromycin,Dental Abscess,3.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"September 6, 2020",2,"Started erythromycin medication for toothache/onset of infection. Now the 3rd day on meds, still no significant relief of pain due to oncoming infection. After reading comments I see this medication can take a little time to start working, hopefully I'll get relief soon. I also experienced severe stomach cramps, along with intestinal discomfort, nausea but no vomiting. I'm in the same position due to pandemic cannot see dentist anytime soon. Not sure what to do now.",Jerry
