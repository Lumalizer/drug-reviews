Could anyone please tell me what he could  as I just can not bare to see him suffer like this, it is so very hard to get an appointment as all the NHS dentists are not taking on new patients due to this virus. Should he call the dentist he did see or go to our nearest hospital dentist. Please could someone help me with this please, what would you do ?",Bluebird
1,Amoxicillin,Dental Abscess,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"November 30, 2021",1,Ngl (not gone lie) this does work. I remember back in September I took amoxicillin  because I was having a really bad toothache so went to the dentist and they prescribed me liquid Motrin and amoxicillin I took it and had the best night sleep. I took it again for the first week no pain see where I messed up at is I didn’t  finish the course cuz the pain did not come back. Well I should’ve I guess cuz I’m here now because just got prescribed again for the same thing and gone to make sure I take it til the course is finished ✔️.  If you smoke weed or cigarettes don't TBH cuz it’s gonna make your tooth hurt more and stop it from healing as well. Honestly I didn’t like the feeling it was giving me while smoking weed.,Yanna

3,Amoxicillin,Dental Abscess,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"October 14, 2021",1,"I described pain and hypersensitivity to temperature to my dentist of teeth on left side, dentist could not find anything visually or by x-rays. I ASKED for antibiotic in case of infection after googling my symptoms and dentist wrote a script for penicillin VK. The pain went away within the 7 day course of treatment, but of course came back in a month. I went to an endodontist who confirmed infection, prescribed amoxicillin (3X 500mg/day for 6 days). The pain subsided after 24 hours nearly gone after 3 days and then I  going in for a root canal. As others have advised: complete the entire course of treatment. BUT, you also have to treat the underlying cause (tooth rot) to solve the problem.",k peters

5,Amoxicillin,Dental Abscess,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"August 6, 2021",0,Had a broken tooth for a few years it got infected and I've taken amoxicillin for it more then a few times. I because pregnant and the tooth pain erupted like a pain I've never had before and I already have 2 children and this pain is far worse then giving birth. Dentist took my tooth out scrapped out the infection and out in a bone graft and sewed it up with stitches. I'm still in a world of pain amoxicillin does absolute nothing if anything I feel its making pain worse. I can't take anything but tylenol because I'm 6 months pregnant. Worse pain of my entire life. It is awful and amoxicillin does not always work especially for tooth infections.,Dee
6,Amoxicillin,Dental Abscess,1.0,,"July 21, 2021",2,"So I’ve been miserable the whole month because I got an extremely painful infection around the gums of one of my bottom wisdom teeth molars because it didn’t erupt fully. WORST PAIN OF MY LIFE! I had to get emergency surgery since antibiotics and salt rinses weren’t resolving the issue. Got all four teeth. Doc prescribed me ibuprofen and amoxicillin so the infection wouldn’t come back. I had to be driven in the hospital by ambulance after I finished the round of amoxicillin the day before. Had an epipen administered into me and IVs of steroids and benadryl while my heart was being monitored. I have bad hives all over my body. My face swelled, throat was closing up. I went into anaphylactic shock because of this med. I'm allergic to it and almost died. Just beware because there are quite a few people that can be allergic to this family of drug so monitor yourself carefully. It was a terrifying experience for me.",After wisdom teeth removal

One year later dentist prescribed amoxicillin for root canal and hey presto pain in neck, jaw, arm disappeared after fourth tablet. Unfortunately upon this work taking a 2 weeks pain re-appeared in neck, jaw, arm and I woke up with 'poison' pains in elbows, knees, under arms, heart, wrists, hips, groin, feet which worked off over each day. Then added headache in sinuses and brain for three weeks so far. Doctor stumped, and refused to prescribe antiobiotics twice before, now I have a one week dose of 250mg from me insisting third time this is a bacterial infection from my abscess and I don't want physio. I've searched up dental abscess to bacterermia to septic arthritis and lymph nodes. Amoxycillin worked 100% in lockdown and from the dentist so I think it will work again.",capsule

Took it for 3 days for pain to became manageable.Well it went away until I started eating my celery sticks once more (munch, munch, munch) then again, on amoxicillin, every time my top back molar touches that bad tooth I see birds flying around my head, not robins, but blackbirds, ok not literally.Immense pain, taken max dose of paracetamol, did nothiung!  I took ibucalm - got 2 hours sleep but woke, realising my back upper teeth were grinding on the 'PAINFUL TOOTH' at the bottom.  I've got panda eyes. Lost 3 lbs, 45mins after soup, the pain goes CRAZY.Once I had a slice of bread and  I nearly went to war on myself when I chewed on the back tooth.  I'm in agony, sometimes I want to cry, other times I want to smash things up and when I've taken ibucalm, I get to watch a bit of TV.My poor tummy isn't used to this starvation.

Though it needs to be paired with some type of pain reliever to mitigate the pain since you cannot drink alcohol ( which besides pain meds is the only thing that lessens a tooth ache) and for a tooth ache advil doesnt cut it you need Vicaden, Norco or Percaset ..sadly so many drug addicts  have made being prescribed any of the above listed pain meds a rare occurrence.",DrewPM86

I've tried everything but she can't eat at all because of the extreme amount of pain it causes her. EVEN private dentist said she can't do anything and my mam should get better the same day - that was 2 days ago. If anyone at all has any advice please please give it to me.

I have no idea if it's working or not but after reading the reviews of no results I recommend that if you have not seen any positive results OR you experience negative results that you should question the quality control of the manufacturer, because if the manufacturer cuts corners in the production line then you are more likely to experience negative results from the result of poor quality than you are from the drug.

I was also prescribed 800 mg of ibuprofen which barely helped as well as taking 1000mg of Tylenol which also barely made a dent in my pain. I started the medication Wednesday evening before Thanksgiving and didn't get much relief until Saturday morning when it was entirely gone. I would gargle salt water and tried orajel  but the only thing that really got me through was constantly sipping and swishing ice cold water. It kept my mouth numb enough that I could handle but I was literally swishing every 5 minutes but it definitely helped. I'm currently on day 3 and was finally able to enjoy a plate of Thanksgiving leftovers! Just give the medication some time to work and definitely keep a bottle of ice cold water with you at all times!,Kammy

But here’s something I would like to share with other people experiencing dental related pain which I’ve had a lot of over the years...Your sinuses play a role in the equation. Sinus pressure can exacerbate dental pain. It will likely be uncomfortable while you do it, but try massaging your sinuses upwards and out. Massage the muscles at your temple. Feel around your face and head. You’ll find points which are particularly sensitive. Dental pain can resonate throughout your head and massaging your sinuses and head can be a tremendous help! At times it has actually minimized my pain because the sinus pressure was making the pain worse and once I massaged my sinuses (upwards and out) the pressure was relieved. I did this in conjunction with ibuprofen and a heating pad. Of course it won’t cure it, only the appropriate dental work is going to solve it, but in many cases doing this will help to minimize your suffering in the meantime.",DElle777
