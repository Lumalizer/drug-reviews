1,Clarithromycin,Dental Abscess,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"April 19, 2021",0,I do not reccomened this drug. My first dose gave me an awful metallic taste in my mouth which is making me super nauseous. I can't wait for these side effects to go away. Feels just like having the flu.,Lowe
2,Clarithromycin,Dental Abscess,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"November 8, 2020",10,I was given Clarithromycin 250mg twice a day for tooth abscess. This is the third time I have had this drug for different dental problems. I find it to be very effective. I am allergic to penicillin and very sensitive to erythromycin and metronidazole which both make miserable. Also I find bizarrely that it gives me a marked sense of general wellbeing and I feel very chilled and calm - very positive side effect! This has happened each time I have taken the drug.,Anonymous
3,Clarithromycin,Dental Abscess,3.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"April 28, 2020",8,"Recently took a weeks course of this antibiotic clarithromycin and now since I have finished the course I have lost my sense of taste and smell. Food is like chewing cardboard, I really hope it comes back anyone else experience this? It's just I asked my cousin who is a dr and she has said clarithromycin wouldn't cause that, its possibly seasonal allergies doing it",Kitty
4,Clarithromycin,Dental Abscess,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"June 20, 2019",12,"I took HALF of 1 pill & waited  one hour and took the other half. One hour later my HEART was racing, I had EXTREME NAUSEA, I developed a DISGUSTING TASTE in my mouth that tasted like COPPER! I use this reference because as a kid, I once put money (a coin) in my mouth & that is what it tasted like. I developed some ANXIETY (I've taken meds for this for 25 + years.) This by far is the WORSE ANTIBIOTIC I have a ever taken & WILL NEVER again. I've NEVER experienced this from a Antibiotic! I will put it on my ALLERGIES list. I noticed after writing this, another person had a very similar experience.",Happy
5,Clarithromycin,Dental Abscess,3.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"August 15, 2018",9,"I've developed a horrendous taste in my mouth, it hasn't gone away, it's currently 3:39 in the morning, I'm awake with insomnia mostly due to the horrifying taste that seems etched into my taste buds. I've barely slept. I've also had awful headaches. I've been incredibly dizzy and weak and have barely left bed.  I've experienced wildly exacerbated anxiety, the first & second night I was up checking my pulse every five minutes feeling like I was about to die. As well as this just a general feeling of being out of it, foggy & not myself, I've even experience really dark thoughts which again is completely out of character, I have never been like this in my life.I rang my GP and she basically dismissed this even though they're all listed as actual side effects on the packaging. It's also worth mentioning that I take them at the same time like clockwork, with a probiotic and a huge jug of water which has definitely helped me stave off any severe GI symptoms.",Zdl
6,Clarithromycin,Dental Abscess,5.0,,"April 29, 2018",6,"I was given this 500mg 2x a day after Amox did not completely knock out an infection. It took my pain away, but on the 6th day I got a racing heart so bad that I thought I was having a heart attack. I thought it was due to a protein drink I just drank (I was still on only soft foods for the extraction). I thought to no longer drink that drink and tried my best to sleep.  The next day I had just a slightly odd feeling in my heart. I took the meds and within the hour I felt awful. I was scared to stop taking it. I took one more dose that day and hours after I knew I had to stop. I looked online and saw it can cause problems in people with heart issues including sudden death. Good grief! I had no other side effects. No nightmares, no gut issues (I upped how many probiotics I take on antibiotics) I only had the racing heart and palpitations that made my heart feel like it would explode. I did not sleep last night because I was holding my chest and praying to God. Be careful & mind yourself.",TM
7,Clarithromycin,Dental Abscess,,Taken for less than 1 month,"October 13, 2017",3,"The swelling at the back of my mouth (where my wisdom tooth was pulled from years before) went down after a couple days, but my upper back/ribs and around to the front of my chest is tight and uncomfortably sore. Not sure what this is from? Maybe the antibiotic medicine, or the naproxin....",Anonymous
8,Clarithromycin,Dental Abscess,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"January 16, 2016",8,This medicine has made me so sick I should just live in the bathroom,Horrible
9,Clarithromycin,Dental Abscess,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"March 11, 2015",16,"I have been fighting face swelling and shooting pain for over a month. Went to many different doctors they all kept telling me sinus infection , rebound sinus infection blah blah finally got tired of the constant pain and swelling and the horrible congestion. I started researching and found stuff that led me to believe it was an abscess I set up a dentist appointment up the next day which was yesterday. After Dr looked and did a set of X-rays determined it was a sinus infection not treated properly that in return infected my mouth. He gave me Clindamycin 150mg 1 pill every 6 hours. After the first pill I could feel the congestion breaking up and as gross as it sounds the abscess started to drain! At last somethings working",Tired of the yuck
10,Clarithromycin,Dental Abscess,4.0,,"May 15, 2014",12,I got a dental abscess and I'm taking my clarithromycin and still my cheeks are huge like a golf ball in my mouth and I'm getting worried.,tmp42
11,Clarithromycin,Dental Abscess,7.0,,"December 5, 2011",40,Biaxin (clarithromycin):I started taking Biaxin two days ago for both a dental abscess and chronic bronchitis. So far I haven't noticed a difference but it may take a while. Horrible taste in my mouth and very sleepy. All in all it's not a bad medication so far.,celticgrl
12,Clarithromycin,Dental Abscess,8.0,,"June 8, 2010",83,"I never had a tooth abscess before, I think child birth compares but it went on for days. Finally called my dentist, he prescribed Clarithromycin and it worked wonderfuly.  I'm taking it again right now for a sinus infection, I requested it when I went to see my doctor. Day 2 and the terrible headache with the infection is gone. Clarithromycin will be my antibiotic of choice from now on.",ThoothHurtie
