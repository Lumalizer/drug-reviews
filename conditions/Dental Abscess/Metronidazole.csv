0,Metronidazole,Dental Abscess,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"March 24, 2022",0,"It does the job but be prepared for a long, rough road if you're body reacts to this like mine did. I had a dental infection that wouldn't go away with keflex or penicillin, so they prescribed this for me & within 2 days the pain in my tooth was finally gone. However, around day two of the meds I began experiencing extreme dizziness/vertigo, nausea, throwing up, loss of appetite, pain in my mid abdomen that felt like the worst hunger pains one could ever feel. Borderline debilitating! I almost considered feeling the pain of the tooth in order to stop feeling the pain of this medicine. I am on day 5 now & have just begun itching badly. Can't sleep, can't get comfortable. The only thing I found that helps ease the problem a little is to eat first thing in the morning, always eat when you take the pill even if you have no appetite and wanna throw up at the thought of food (this medicine definitely did that to me) there is also a bad taste. This pill is both wonderful & horrible.",Thanksb2jesus

Went back to the dentist 5 days after extraction and had a dry socket. Cleaned it out packed it and gave me metronidazole 400g 3 times a day. I am now on day 2 and only just start to kick in. Paracetamol and ibroprufen did not do anything towards the pain. I do feel nausea , bad headache and developed an itchy rash on my jaw line and neck also my legs feel weak.

First time round I had them it kicked in after a day or so. This time round it’s taking a little longer but I can feel it working. I’m on day 2 of tablets now and the swelling has changed and become flatter. I had pain radiating to my ear and down my throat and the throats eased a bit. Yes these give me a dodgy belly and this time round have wiped me out (I’ve been awake for about 3 hours of the day on day one of these) but if they work as well as last time it’s a small price to pay for the effectiveness of these tablets.,metronidazole

I took the second with lunch at around 2pm. The pain was by now almost unbearable. On inspection, a large abscess had come up next to my infected tooth. A few hours later the abscess burst. After thoroughly rinsing, I realised all the pain had disappeared. It’s now 2 days later and it’s still fine.

Didn't sleep well due to pain.Day 2: Swollen face, felt very tired, could barely do anything. Felt extremely sleepy, loss of appetite and felt sick when trying to eat more than 4 spoons of rice. Felt like I was depressed (probably also due to the fact that I may have to get a tooth extraction)Day 3: The WORST!: Nausea throughout the night, especially in the morning. Couldn't even have breakfast as I felt like vomiting as soon as I tried to eat. I had to drink garlic and lemon to feel better. Felt extremely tired, low mood, sleepy, pretty much spent the whole day in bed sleeping, stomach was upset, face still Swollen. The tooth pain has improved it only hurts when I bite hard.

Not used to being nauseous or having any kind of side effects at all. But I have found out that smoking marijuana helps with the nausea and the dizziness. Highly recommend the drug if you have an infection. But also highly recommend having a bag of herb for the nausea. I would highly recommend smoking before you take your daily dose. It that stops the nausea before it ever happens.,bez336
