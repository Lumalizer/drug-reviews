2,Flagyl,Dental Abscess,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"July 22, 2021",3,"Absolutely avoid! I'm a 29 year old male, rarely if ever take medication but unfortunately developed periodontitis due to a wisdom tooth. My dentist prescribed me Flagyl and warned me about possible stomach side effects. I took three pills 400mg and woke up the next day a different person. I felt as if I had been poisoned, my head felt like a bowling ball, I felt like I was going to fall over when I stood up. I slept all day and didn't eat a thing. I noticed later that day I could hardly breathe and that my nose was blocked. I had an awful headache and my eyes kept squinting and were sensitive to light, urine was a dark colour, my appetite was diminished to zero. It took a solid four days before I ate anything and was bed ridden 90% of that time. I am still feeling the effects from it (weakness, dizziness, weird vision issues). Peer-reviewed journal articles highlights many of other young people ages ranging from 22-25 with adverse side effects who NEVER recovered.",Anonymous
3,Flagyl,Dental Abscess,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"January 8, 2021",10,"I had teeth abscess and my whole face swelled, it was scary.  I was prescribed augmentin with flagyl  and serodase for a week. I woke up the next day  the swelling increased.  Then within two days  pain decreased,  swelling decreased and by the fifth day everything was gone",lelli
4,Flagyl,Dental Abscess,9.0,,"January 4, 2021",7,"Tooth abscess and facial swelling, took combo of Flagyl and amoxcillin. It worked but did cause nausea. Use combo as instructed",M
5,Flagyl,Dental Abscess,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"November 11, 2020",2,"Flagyl has been very useful, I’ve recently changed my toothbrush and that’s how my gums got infected..I’ve tried amoxicillin first but it won’t works and the pains are not get away, therefore I combined both with this flagyl and luckily I was getting better. Of course I took some painrelievers as well, the ponstan for instance response along with pontalon to prolong its after effect, just as an extra caution. Always be safe and gentle with your body as we are the only responsible person to treat us best!",Bad Boy
6,Flagyl,Dental Abscess,9.0,,"June 9, 2020",94,"I've been in agony with a toothache for two days, I couldn't sleep, nothing. Last night I took 500mg of Flagyl a few hours before I went to bed, slept all night and this morning my mouth isn't even sore. I’ll continue to take it for a week to make sure it kills the bacteria, but so far I like it better than any other antibiotic I've taken for an infected tooth! ",Mel
7,Flagyl,Dental Abscess,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"February 23, 2020",9,No side effects but it doesn't work at all! It's a third day with pain and no improvement. Never again,Dora
8,Flagyl,Dental Abscess,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"August 30, 2019",40,At first I felt a bit nauseous and had a whole body feeling like I had the flu when I started the meds. My dose was 500mg four times daily. I ate an Activia yogurt daily and took Ranitidine to help with nausea. I would find that slowly sipping a caffeinated soda would also help with the nausea and give more energy. I had a severe infection and it cleared it up.,compmend
9,Flagyl,Dental Abscess,,Taken for less than 1 month,"July 30, 2019",58,"I am not one to write reviews but this has to be done. I am based in the UK and was given this medication for wisdom tooth pain. I was told to take it three times a day for 5 days. After two days I was unfortunately a victim of being the 1 in 10,000 to receive rare side effects from the medication. I had external dizziness & blurred vision every 30seconds. I went to go GP(doctor) and they said I was given a high dosage and it should of been 2 tablets per day. After 9 painful days the antibiotic was cleared from my body and I am dizzy and blur free. I wrote this reviews because of the hours of research I have seen no one state  how long it took for the side effects to disappear without hospital treatment. Hopefully this helps someone. Overall the tablet got rid of the pain but the extreme dizziness as a side effects was not worth it",Feeb
10,Flagyl,Dental Abscess,,Taken for less than 1 month,"November 18, 2017",18,"I was prescribed Flagyl three a day for 10 days due to a tonsil abscess.  I’m on the 7th day and I will not be continuing.  This medication feels like torture.  I throw up or dry heave every time I take a pill.  Nothing tastes normal, which makes me not want to eat nor drink.  I am beyond weak and have lost so much weight in so little time.  My doctors told me this was normal, when in fact it feels rather unhealthy.  I would honestly rather have my initial infection then to experience the side effects of this medication ever again.  It’s that bad.",peritonsilar abscess
11,Flagyl,Dental Abscess,10.0,,"November 15, 2017",21,"For a few years I have had this horrid smell coming from under my crown. I have had dental care from my dentist but the smell would persist. My dentist said he didn't notice an abscess but I told him that fluid was leaking from under the crown as well. I tried amoxicillin for 14 days (two seperate runs) and it calmed the smell down some but once I stopped the med, the smell came back full force. I am about to finish flagyl and I don't notice the smell at all. This is great, taste like crap but it works.",Chronic tooth funk
12,Flagyl,Dental Abscess,9.0,,"July 14, 2017",31,Was reluctant to take this has read reviews and was going on holiday. But weighed up either bad toothache or risk side effects. No effects what so ever. Shifted my toothache. But didn't risk alcohol at all. Was bit itchy but nothing bad. Would take again if had too.,Oldwomaninashoe
13,Flagyl,Dental Abscess,10.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"May 22, 2017",27,"Caught a bacterial infection from daughter visiting from Japan August 2016. Could not get well. Unknowingly had a dental abcess that made me even more ill. Did some research and found flagyl with Augmentin had helped others. Got dental problems addressed and took 21 days of flagyl 500 mg x 2 daily with Augmentin 875 mg x 2 daily. Got well. Had to have more invasive dental work and am currently taking 21 day course of flagyl 1000 mg x 2 daily with 875 mg Augmentin x2 daily to head off infection recurring. If you have been ill and given up hope, try this combo. Yep it's a lot of antibiotics but I was quite sick and it helped me. I was infection free at time of last dental work but taking this as a preventive course.",KateAnnD
14,Flagyl,Dental Abscess,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"October 2, 2015",68,"This medication could have saved my life! I had a root canal gone awry. The emergency dentist prescribed Clindamycin and Flagyl stat. Could not take the Flagyl as I had swallowed listerine (has alcohol in it). The next morning an Endodentist redid the root canal, and he said to take the Clindamycin only. Two days--and a LOT more pain and swelling later--I found myself at night with enormous swelling spreading to my upper mouth with more throbbing pain, With nothing to lose, I took one dose (500mg) of Flagyl. Within 2 hours I felt no pain--it was like someone took water out of a balloon. Thank goodness, I believe I had an odd bacterial infection. I'll take both antibiotics for the duration. No alcohol on Flagyl--bad side effects!",lch1000
15,Flagyl,Dental Abscess,4.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"July 12, 2012",94,"This was the first time I received Metronidazole for a tooth infection, usually they prescribe Keflex (cephalexin) or Amoxacillin. I would say that the Metronidazole worked quicker at easing the pain and It wasn't a capsule so I had an easier time swallowing it however, I have been suffering serious nausea followed by diarhea since I began taking it. Then last night without thinking about the interaction had a few drinks and spent the night vomiting and very ill with nausea, dry heaves etc. DO NOT DRINK ALCOHOL WITH THIS MEDICINE and always read your labels and accompanying info, I usually do but I've never had any kind of reaction to an antibiotic so I got lazy I suppose, because it was clearly stated on the bottle.",Anonymous
16,Flagyl,Dental Abscess,6.0,,"July 13, 2010",113,"It is very useful for treating dental abscess but a combination will work better, along with  amoxicillin. Flagyl alone might not be good enough.",dr d
17,Flagyl,Dental Abscess,8.0,,"October 12, 2009",110,It is a good antibiotic for anaerobic bacteria. I prescribe it for my patients in conjunction with another antibiotic for the aerobic bacteria (example Amoxil).,refa3a
