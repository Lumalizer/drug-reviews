0,Botox,Dystonia,,Taken for 5 to 10 years,"June 12, 2017",2,I have adult onset generalized dystonia.  I receive approx. 50 injections every 10 weeks.   The injections start at the bottom of my feet and end at the top of my head. I have constant migraines and noises in my head.The botox really helps the spasms and cramps.   The migraines and noises are kept to a minimum with the botox.It has been a godsend.,Anonymous
1,Botox,Dystonia,8.0,,"December 4, 2011",3,Highly effective for tonic spasms around my eyes. Drawbacks are that it is only temporary and is also dependent on skill of doctor administering to hit exact spot to relieve spasm. Usually lasts around 3 months for me though it varies for other patients.,twatface
