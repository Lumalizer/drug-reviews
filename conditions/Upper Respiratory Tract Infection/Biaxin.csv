After 3 days I didn't feel sick anymore but the side effects were too much.",Anonymous
7,Biaxin,Upper Respiratory Tract Infection,8,,"December 29, 2009",85,"I cannot tell you how worried I was about the side effects of this drug after I read the reviews and listened to what some of my friends said.  I ended up not having any.  I was prescribed Augmentin first for my upper resp infection/ear infection and it didn't work at all.  I took some advice from a nurse where I work about how to take the Biaxin.  I ate my meal first, then ate about 3 small pieces of dark chocolate and took the pill after that.  Let me tell you the dark chocolate is a miracle worker.  One time I ate chocolate after I took the pill and I got the nasty metal taste.  It is TERRIBLE and you can't get rid of it for hours.  So, remember...DARK chocolate BEFORE the pill.",Anonymous
