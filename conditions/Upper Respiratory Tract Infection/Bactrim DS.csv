1,Bactrim DS,Upper Respiratory Tract Infection,1.0,,"November 4, 2017",5,"When I was 15 I learned that I was allergic to Bactrim. 11 years later the Doctor prescribed me with this medication stating that our allergies change. I was nervous to take this medicine, but I was so sick with an ear infection that I decided to give it a try. The worst experience in my life. I only took two pills one in the morning and one before bed. I was up from 12 Am- 6 Am non-stop puking. I could not hold anything down. At first I thought I had the flu as every bone in my body was in pain... After a few hours of sleep and not taking this Rx I then realized I am still extremely allergic to this medication. I would never want someone to go through what I went through. I have not taken this medication since yesterday and I have not puked.",KirstiePaige
