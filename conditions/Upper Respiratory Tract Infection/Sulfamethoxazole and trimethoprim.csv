1,Sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim,Upper Respiratory Tract Infection,,,"April 26, 2020",3,Was prescribed  sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim  by my doctor since I’m showing signs of a mild UTI . Have to take the medication 2 times a day for 3 days . Took the first pill felt nothing unusual . Took the second pill and immediately started noticing the horrible side effects . I COULD NOT BREATHE ! I was sweating I had a really bad headache I have anxiety and this drug makes you even more anxious I would not recommend if you have anxiety this heightens it ! I also did not notice how jittery I was until I actually payed close attention to my body .,Anonymous
2,Sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim,Upper Respiratory Tract Infection,3.0,,"November 3, 2019",0,"Will not be taking this sulfamethoxazole with trimethoprim combo antibiotic again, it worked well but the side effects were horrible. In the 3 days of taking them I experience severe shakes, itching, insomnia and extreme panic and anxiety.  It felt like I was losing my mind and I also developed a yeast infection but that’s a natural reaction from any antibiotic. I’m almost on my last dose, and I’m definitely discontinuing it’s not worth it.",Anonymous

5,Sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim,Upper Respiratory Tract Infection,1.0,,"November 4, 2017",5,"Bactrim DS (sulfamethoxazole / trimethoprim):When I was 15 I learned that I was allergic to Bactrim. 11 years later the Doctor prescribed me with this medication stating that our allergies change. I was nervous to take this medicine, but I was so sick with an ear infection that I decided to give it a try. The worst experience in my life. I only took two pills one in the morning and one before bed. I was up from 12 Am- 6 Am non-stop puking. I could not hold anything down. At first I thought I had the flu as every bone in my body was in pain... After a few hours of sleep and not taking this Rx I then realized I am still extremely allergic to this medication. I would never want someone to go through what I went through. I have not taken this medication since yesterday and I have not puked.",KirstiePaige
