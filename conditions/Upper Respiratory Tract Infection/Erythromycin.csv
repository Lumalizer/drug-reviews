0,Erythromycin,Upper Respiratory Tract Infection,1,Taken for less than 1 month,"January 4, 2017",9,"I was prescribed this drug after a chest infection had returned an the initial antibiotics had not 100% worked. Within a day I had gotten a lot worse, and began passing out and ended up in hospital for 6 hours. They informed me that this drug was not always reliable and they had a woman in the ward for 6 weeks due to her taking these for 3 days. Reluctantly I came off this drug and went back onto a longer dosage of my initial antibiotics. Needless to say I got a lot better quickly, and the infection had disappeared within a week.",Lukeclem
1,Erythromycin,Upper Respiratory Tract Infection,1,Taken for less than 1 month,"July 16, 2016",5,"I am taking LOFEPRAMINE and PERICYAZINE for mental health issues, and found that ERYTHROMYCIN , wiped out my mental health meds. It was as if I was not taking them, and I must now , NOT take  Erythromycin or any other MACROLIDES, this is the group of meds that Erythromycin belongs to. I found it hard to believe that an anti-biotic could cause such profound effects. I hope this review helps other people with m.h.issues. If in doubt Google it.",Lynda McEachran
2,Erythromycin,Upper Respiratory Tract Infection,10,,"March 26, 2016",14,"This antibiotic is the best, hands down.  The Z pack doesn't even come close to this. I take this when I get really bad sinus infections that go into my chest and I start feeling better within a couple days. I specifically ask my doctor for this when I get sick because it's the one that really works.",Jude123

7,Erythromycin,Upper Respiratory Tract Infection,8,,"November 20, 2008",39,"I was prescribed to take the medication for sinus, inner ear, and chest infection. It made me terribly sick, so I stopped taking it. I know you're not supposed to stop and start, but I did three times. The most recent was after a medic on the set told me to eat yogurt and the sickness would subside. He said it was something in the bioflavins that helped with the nausea. My entire body felt great once I stayed on the medication as prescribed. Take care!",Anonymous
