0,Keflex,Upper Respiratory Tract Infection,5,,"November 23, 2020",6,"I went to the ER, they said I had a UTI so they gave me keflex 500mg 4 times a day for a week. I despise ANY medication because of the side effects but I didn’t want a kidney infection as that’s way worse so I took it. I had nausea and some mild diarrhea about an hour in, normal right? So a few days in I felt like I was hit by a truck I woke up fatigued and my anxiety was so bad and I developed an achy back that lasted a week even after I was done taking it! I still have some mild diarrhea everyday and it’s been a week since I’ve finished the medicine, I have no clue how I pulled through and took all of it. It did indeed clear up my infection but I still feel sick. I know it’s a turn off reading this and it makes you not wanna take the medicine but you HAVE TOO unless you want a kidney infection which is way worse and you’ll be put on even more antibiotics if that happens. Just pull on through but if you genuinely don’t feel good when taking it, talk to your doctor.",jess
