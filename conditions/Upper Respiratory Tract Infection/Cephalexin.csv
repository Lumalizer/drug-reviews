1,Cephalexin,Upper Respiratory Tract Infection,5.0,,"November 23, 2020",6,"Keflex (cephalexin):I went to the ER, they said I had a UTI so they gave me keflex 500mg 4 times a day for a week. I despise ANY medication because of the side effects but I didn’t want a kidney infection as that’s way worse so I took it. I had nausea and some mild diarrhea about an hour in, normal right? So a few days in I felt like I was hit by a truck I woke up fatigued and my anxiety was so bad and I developed an achy back that lasted a week even after I was done taking it! I still have some mild diarrhea everyday and it’s been a week since I’ve finished the medicine, I have no clue how I pulled through and took all of it. It did indeed clear up my infection but I still feel sick. I know it’s a turn off reading this and it makes you not wanna take the medicine but you HAVE TOO unless you want a kidney infection which is way worse and you’ll be put on even more antibiotics if that happens. Just pull on through but if you genuinely don’t feel good when taking it, talk to your doctor.",jess
2,Cephalexin,Upper Respiratory Tract Infection,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"August 13, 2020",15,"I have chronic allergies and sinus problems . I am usually put on Levaquin but , it hasn’t seemed to work anymore after the past few years . My ENT-s always like to tell me  it’s just inflammation  - when I am 60 years old and I know that sometimes it IS an infection. Anyway - 2 weeks ago I went to an urgent care and was seen by a kindly , older, very intelligent doctor . He mentioned Keflex , and I thought   oh yeah , I took that 8 years ago when my first sinus infection happened and it really worked . The experienced doctor gave this , and it was AMAZING .  I felt much better after the first day .  I can’t believe how the so called experts don’t think this works .I had NO side effects , but I take probiotics every day no matter what . So happy that this doctor re discovered this medicine for me !",Tennis semi pro

4,Cephalexin,Upper Respiratory Tract Infection,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"November 1, 2019",82,I'm 68 years old & went to an urgent care because my Dr was on vacation. I knew I had bronchitis & an upper respiratory infection. I know after all these years if I have an infection or a cold or flu. I was also a pharmacy tech.A nurse practitioner said I just had flu symstems & wouldn't give me an antibiotic. Why oh why don't some young Drs in the medical field don't believe in antibiotics? What generation has died from antibiotics??? I had waited an hour to get in & she told me I had the flu?I was in so much pain from deep coughing & demanded to see another Dr.I said I'm not leaving without some kind of antibiotic & that I knew the difference between the flu from an infection.They finally gave me amoxicillin.It didn't work for me this time (It usually works for sinus & ear infections.)I went to my Dr & she gave me Keflex.This is a great for bronchitis.I'm so upset at these young Drs who don't believe in antibiotics...People will end up in the hospital or worse. It's a disgrace.!,Ann

8,Cephalexin,Upper Respiratory Tract Infection,10.0,,"December 13, 2016",74,"Hello guys!So I went to a local urgent care place on Saturday complaining about headache, chest congestion, cough, runny nose, and sneezing. I informed the doctor on duty that I've already taken my flu shot and I really don't think what I have is the flu. So after the typical check up, he diagnosed me with acute bronchitis/sinusitis and prescribed me Cephalexin 500mg 2xday for 10 days, today is my third day taking the meds and I feel better already. Not to mention, I think I might've had a vaginal bacterial infection or uti and that has cleared as well. Definitely killed 2 birds with 1 stone. Ohh...and the Dr. gave me a prescription for an extra 10 days...definitely will be saving them! Although it's not recommended, I'll use them again!!",OneSickGirl
