0,Augmentin,Upper Respiratory Tract Infection,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"October 14, 2020",2,"This medication Augmentin is absolutely horrible on me. I’ve been prescribed this twice. I’ve taken it with and without food and both times I vomited violently to the point I was hospitalized. I became so dehydrated they couldn’t even get a urine sample by catheter. I sweated so badly my jeans I had on and t shirt took two days to air dry. I became so delirious from vomiting that I stripped naked in front of my mother and children, then passed out. She called the ambulance. I couldn’t handle a days dosage neither time.",ChinaDoll
1,Augmentin,Upper Respiratory Tract Infection,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"November 8, 2019",12,"I have really bad anxiety about eating things in general, I have always struggled with this. However, when I started taking Augmentin, not only did it greatly improve my infection, it made me really relaxed, so much that I was finally able to eat whatever I liked without worrying about it. I ended up eating normally like I should and everything was perfect. Unfortunately, I had to stop taking it at some point and my anxiety came back a bit worse than it was before. I've been seeing really bad reviews for it, but I've only ever had great experiences. :)",Ana
2,Augmentin,Upper Respiratory Tract Infection,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"October 13, 2019",5,"Augmentin worst experience of my life. I was pre diabetic at the time, and after one dose, I started throwing up and had diarrhea so badly and for so long that I ended up in the ER with a glucose reading of 47!!! They were worried I had cdif ie Clostridium difficile infection (despite taking probiotics) and quarantined me in the one hospital wing. I was in there for days and it finally stopped after  multiple bags of fluid. I could barely eat anything for 2 weeks and was a mess. Luckily I didn't have cdif, but it was one of the few times in my life that I was genuinely worried.",G
3,Augmentin,Upper Respiratory Tract Infection,10.0,Taken for 5 to 10 years,"September 5, 2018",15,"I get a bad flu, and bronchitis, unfortunately often, due to pneumonia as a baby damaging my lungs.Augmentin always works, with no side effects, except the general weakness of the illness.However, some doctors have prescribed stronger antibiotics, & they completely mess up my stomach, some with a burning sensation, & I end up losing weight.I am currently recovering, yet again, on Augmentin 625, once a day, 7 days.",Weak Lungs
4,Augmentin,Upper Respiratory Tract Infection,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"September 1, 2018",4,This drug is awful. I have 3 days left and I physically cannot handle it anymore. I'm intensely nauseous every day but I never vomit. I just drool at the mouth and dry heave until it wears away. But by the time the nausea settles it's time to take another pill!It makes going to work almost impossible. I also get unusual headaches and generally feel terrible. Unfortunately it's a holiday so I am unable to contact my doctor for something new. Considering risking it and quitting - never again.,jas93
5,Augmentin,Upper Respiratory Tract Infection,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"June 27, 2018",3,"This caused major bleeding issues for me.After taking for a few days, I started bruising *really* bad and had problems eating anything because my stomach felt like a fire (I took it after eating to try and prevent that, but it didn't work). I was stuck with water, bread, and tiny-cut plain spaghetti.A week into the treatment, I develop a spontaneous LARGE hematoma on my backside that put me in the ER for a night. I may need to have it surgically removed in the next few days.",k

I had a upper respiratory infection cough, cold &sinus infection I took Sudafed and Musine. For a month wasn't getting any better so I went to the doctor and was put on Augmentin 875mg.

7,Augmentin,Upper Respiratory Tract Infection,7.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"February 18, 2018",19,"I took it for a resp/sinus infection. I'm on day 5 and feel about 75% better. Still have yellow phlegm, but not as much as 5 days ago, sinuses are still clogged 50% of the day now. Using flonase and Tylenol as needed. The pills taste absolutely yuck, leaves an aftertaste as bitter as anything I've ever eaten. Takes about an hour to go away. Side note: Augmentin is not a ""cure-all"" It takes care of quite a few infections, but remember, the negative reviews you see here are from people who aren't responding to it. That means 1 of 2 things: You aren't taking it correctly or you're infection is something outside the spectrum that augmenttin can't cure. Now, the best thing to do would be to run cultures, but those cost a nice penny. So, it's just easier to start you on meds because it would most likely cover the organism you have. NOT EVERY infection is the same. Take all reviews w/ a grain of salt.",ricosiko

I had to do something I was prescribed Augmentin 875 mg bid 10 days. (I received Amox/Clav). It has not cleared anything up and not to mention tonight I have severe nausea and thrush.

10,Augmentin,Upper Respiratory Tract Infection,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"January 19, 2017",18,"After one dose I was in ER.  I was vomiting violently and became very confused.  My husband said I kept asking the same questions over and over.  I had memory loss and still can't remember the day I took the dose. I had an MRI and did not have a stroke, all other tests were normal.   It might work well for some but clearly it really affects others negatively.",rhaeg
11,Augmentin,Upper Respiratory Tract Infection,9.0,,"December 15, 2016",16,I am now on day 7 taking Augmentin  for upper respiratory and sinus infection. Was so ill could not wait to start taking it. I feel a lot better but still not there yet. Still have dry cough at night and sinus problems. On 2nd day if taking developed diarrhea very dark and loose. Still have it but not as severe.   These are just inconveniences compared to how sick I was. Glad I'm taking it,Buttercup15
12,Augmentin,Upper Respiratory Tract Infection,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"October 21, 2016",11,"I was prescribed Augmentin several months ago for a severe sinus and upper respiratory infection, 8 days into a 10 day course I was even more sick than when I started.  I  ended up on Levaquin and steriods for 14 days as a result.  Once again a few days ago my primary care prescribed Augmentin for another sinus & UTI  despite my protests.  Within two days my chest is considerably worse and I am also experiencing terrible stomach pain and nausea.  I will be on the phone tomorrow insisting on a new medication.",Eonssomd
13,Augmentin,Upper Respiratory Tract Infection,1.0,,"October 12, 2016",12,"My chest infection has got worse after 7 days on Augmentin. I am usually given amoxicillin. So Amoxicillin has kind lost its effectiveness. Augmentin contains Amocilillin as well. I assume this is why it is not working for me. Over here, there's no test or sharing medical history. I think GP's choice of antibiotics is bit ramdon. But if amoxicillin is not working anymore, I would not use Augmentin.",Monica Q
14,Augmentin,Upper Respiratory Tract Infection,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"July 6, 2016",19,"I have Emphysema, because I worked in a school swimming pool, and therefore was in contact, with Sodium Hypochlorite--which is Chlorine in it's neat state---. At a routine medical was found out to be deadly allergic to Chlorine, and so had to leave the pool. Living life with Emphysema, is hard. Augmentin--or Co-Amoxiclave as it's known by in G.B.. which is where I live, but find U.S.A. web sites more giving with easier to understand articles.  As I said C.O.A.D.  is hard to live with and I get frequent chest infections all year round, but find Augmentin is the all round Antibiotic for me, as I don't get any side affects, so maybe I'm one of the lucky ones that way. It is easy to take, and very easy to break in half, if you find it big .",Lynda McEachran
15,Augmentin,Upper Respiratory Tract Infection,7.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"March 8, 2016",18,I been on Augmentin for 7 days now. It is helping my upper respiratory infection but I'm having anxiety and very loose stools (very dark diarrhea) also my heart beats faster than normal too. I've only got 3 days left to take it. I'll be glad when it's done. I also feel fatigued and a little blurry eyes. My body is very sensitive to drugs. But despite all that I do feel it has helped with the upper respiratory problem. I'm just ready to feel better and healthy!,MsEva58
16,Augmentin,Upper Respiratory Tract Infection,9.0,,"March 5, 2016",15,Within 20 hrs (2 doses) I was feeling better. My lungs still hurt when I would cough but they didn't hurt when I would take a shallow breath. I did get a pretty bad headache that was controlled with APAP.  Loose stools developed after day 3. I increased fluids and fiber (ice cold smoothy worked great to fulfill these). Day 6 I was back to normal except the loose stool. No other complaints. I was also on pearls and codiene during this time. Side effects well worth benefit after how bad I was hurting.,MurseWI

It's been almost two days now and while I feel slightly better, the nausea and upset stomach is too much for me. I have eaten both yogurt or rice before taking it and I still get very sick. It is also making everything I eat seem extremely salty. Even when I breathe, I taste salt. I've called my doctor and they're changing my antibiotic to something else. Apparently this one is making my potassium levels rise too high.",Halli

23,Augmentin,Upper Respiratory Tract Infection,10.0,,"November 19, 2013",53,Was prescribed Augmentin for sinus and upper respiratory infection and within 48 Hrs I felt remarkably better. Before taking any meds I felt as bad as I have ever felt with any type of cold related illness.  I will now request this Med next time I have any similar illness. I did not experience any side effects except maybe a little thirsty. If so it was minor enough that I wasn't 100% sure that it was even a side effect.,DavidM77
