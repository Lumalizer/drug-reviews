0,Bactrim,Upper Respiratory Tract Infection,3,,"April 1, 2017",12,Very annoying side effect for me was the constant air bubbles stuck in my throat.   Bad taste and tastebuds are effected....felt like mouth and throat were slightly numb and  felt as if  I had a thick film in mouth/throat.  Constantly felt like I had to swallow.,Cdcd
1,Bactrim,Upper Respiratory Tract Infection,1,,"February 20, 2017",3,Was prescribed Bactrim for a UTI . Within minutes of taking my first dose I became extremely itchy and developed welts... I stopped taking it and it took two days for the itch to calm down. So apparently I'm allergic to it. Had to get a different drug called in which was CIPRO will not take that one do to bad side effects so now I'm on Macrobid. Will see how this goes.,Dreamspirit
