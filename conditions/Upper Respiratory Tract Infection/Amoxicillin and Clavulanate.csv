That was two weeks ago and there’s no proof that it caused the illness; dr thought it could have been so she gave me another antibiotic..Doxycycline. Hoping it works.,Trumpet626
1,Amoxicillin and Clavulanate,Upper Respiratory Tract Infection,9.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"January 18, 2022",0,"I didn’t used to like this antibiotic because it gave me awful side effects - I thought I was going to jump out of my skin, anxiety, heart racing, extreme headache. I had to stop taking it. But I discovered what the problem was. Aurobindo pharmaceuticals! This is a generic drug maker and every time I’ve used their various antibiotics I get a bad reaction. It must be the fillers they use. I was prescribed Augmentin for bad cough, sore throat, ear infection that wouldn’t go away for weeks. I was hesitant but desperate. I asked for anything but Aurobindo. They gave me Sandoz. Miracle! I feel so much better within 24 hours and I can tolerate it.",JKD

3,Amoxicillin and Clavulanate,Upper Respiratory Tract Infection,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"October 31, 2020",6,"Hope my experience  helps others, in the past I used generic Amox/clav price was $12 for 10 days.  Had harsh side effects, never completing med, stopped after 4 days.  Horrid anxiety, nervousness, jittery, bloating, headache, extreme fatigue.I spoke with pharmacist, prior to next prescription, about harsh side effects.  This was Feb 2019, when I went to pick up med, I was told $55 I thought they made a mistake from $12, my med was changed to original brand I believe.  Instead of generic orange bottle, med came in solid white bottle, with company label.  Med cost me $55 opposed to $12I took the antibiotic for 10 days, and to my surprise no side effects, I was in disbelief.  I am on antibiotic right now, 4th day, same manufacturer, thus far no side effects.  So those of you having major side effects, ask for different pharma manufacturer or brand opposed to generic.",Ace
4,Amoxicillin and Clavulanate,Upper Respiratory Tract Infection,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"October 19, 2020",1,I took amoxicillin/clavulanate for 5 days and I got severe diarrhea and I still have my upper respiratory infection. I stopped because the pills started looking really weird like the internal ingredients started expanding breaking the outer coating it's weird looking. I'm going to go back to the pharmacy where I got it and see if other pills are doing that too that's why I quit taking it,Link

I’ve been prescribed this twice. I’ve taken it with and without food and both times I vomited violently to the point I was hospitalized. I became so dehydrated they couldn’t even get a urine sample by catheter. I sweated so badly my jeans I had on and t shirt took two days to air dry. I became so delirious from vomiting that I stripped naked in front of my mother and children, then passed out. She called the ambulance. I couldn’t handle a days dosage neither time.",ChinaDoll
6,Amoxicillin and Clavulanate,Upper Respiratory Tract Infection,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"November 8, 2019",12,"Augmentin (amoxicillin / clavulanate):I have really bad anxiety about eating things in general, I have always struggled with this. However, when I started taking Augmentin, not only did it greatly improve my infection, it made me really relaxed, so much that I was finally able to eat whatever I liked without worrying about it. I ended up eating normally like I should and everything was perfect. Unfortunately, I had to stop taking it at some point and my anxiety came back a bit worse than it was before. I've been seeing really bad reviews for it, but I've only ever had great experiences. :)",Ana
7,Amoxicillin and Clavulanate,Upper Respiratory Tract Infection,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"October 13, 2019",5,"Augmentin (amoxicillin / clavulanate):Augmentin worst experience of my life. I was pre diabetic at the time, and after one dose, I started throwing up and had diarrhea so badly and for so long that I ended up in the ER with a glucose reading of 47!!! They were worried I had cdif ie Clostridium difficile infection (despite taking probiotics) and quarantined me in the one hospital wing. I was in there for days and it finally stopped after  multiple bags of fluid. I could barely eat anything for 2 weeks and was a mess. Luckily I didn't have cdif, but it was one of the few times in my life that I was genuinely worried.",G
8,Amoxicillin and Clavulanate,Upper Respiratory Tract Infection,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"August 24, 2019",6,I started taking this medication 2 days ago for a bad upper respiratory infection and ear infection. I was really sick I mean really sick. Within the second day I was feeling so much better. The only thing I have is the runs but I don't know if this could be from all the cough medicine and aspirin I was taking along with it. It really helped to loosen the mucus up in my lungs and my ear also. Everyone had different reactions to different medication so beware of that fact. At least now I can breathe laying down at night.,Moose
9,Amoxicillin and Clavulanate,Upper Respiratory Tract Infection,8.0,,"December 13, 2018",12,"I took the 875/125mg every 12 hours for 10 days for walking pneumonia, upper respiratory and sinus infection. Side Effects: fuzzy feeling in my head, dizziness and lethargic. Also had bubbling in my stomach and diarrhea. I want to share some helpful tips that were suggested by my pharmacist: 1. DO NOT take this on an empty stomach. That is a recipe for disaster as this will destroy your insides. Please do yourself a favor and have a hearty meal before taking this. Carb it up with some bread/pasta so there is something in your tummy before this medicine comes in Gladiator Style to battle the bacteria.2. Hydrate! Taking this with water is SO important! Drink at least a bottle of water after taking the pill.3. Take a supplemental Probiotic. I also ate a container of yogurt.4. I read in a review to eat chocolate while on this. Had some M&Ms after the pill. DK if it helped, but it tasted great and made me happy, so to each their own.",Anxious Ally

11,Amoxicillin and Clavulanate,Upper Respiratory Tract Infection,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"September 1, 2018",4,Augmentin (amoxicillin / clavulanate):This drug is awful. I have 3 days left and I physically cannot handle it anymore. I'm intensely nauseous every day but I never vomit. I just drool at the mouth and dry heave until it wears away. But by the time the nausea settles it's time to take another pill!It makes going to work almost impossible. I also get unusual headaches and generally feel terrible. Unfortunately it's a holiday so I am unable to contact my doctor for something new. Considering risking it and quitting - never again.,jas93

16,Amoxicillin and Clavulanate,Upper Respiratory Tract Infection,7.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"February 18, 2018",19,"Augmentin (amoxicillin / clavulanate):I took it for a resp/sinus infection. I'm on day 5 and feel about 75% better. Still have yellow phlegm, but not as much as 5 days ago, sinuses are still clogged 50% of the day now. Using flonase and Tylenol as needed. The pills taste absolutely yuck, leaves an aftertaste as bitter as anything I've ever eaten. Takes about an hour to go away. Side note: Augmentin is not a ""cure-all"" It takes care of quite a few infections, but remember, the negative reviews you see here are from people who aren't responding to it. That means 1 of 2 things: You aren't taking it correctly or you're infection is something outside the spectrum that augmenttin can't cure. Now, the best thing to do would be to run cultures, but those cost a nice penny. So, it's just easier to start you on meds because it would most likely cover the organism you have. NOT EVERY infection is the same. Take all reviews w/ a grain of salt.",ricosiko
