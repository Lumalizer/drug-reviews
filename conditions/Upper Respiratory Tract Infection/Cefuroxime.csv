0,Cefuroxime,Upper Respiratory Tract Infection,8,Taken for less than 1 month,"September 19, 2020",6,"I was prescribed cefuroxime for a swollen throat and post nasal drip problem that I had been suffering for more than 30 days. I was prescribed 500mgs, twice daily, for 10 days.  After reading some of the other reviews I decided to take a probiotic pill after the first pill and a probiotic yogurt after the second pill. I took the probiotics two hours after taking each pill.  It worked perfectly. I had no side effects whatsoever except for a small headache the second day.  I found the large pill a little hard to swallow so I simply split the pill in half and took each half with food. I did not find the taste of the pill as bad as others reported.  After seven days I discontinued the drug as it did not seem to solve the problem.  I am certain others users may have a different outcome so I will not give the drug a bad rating.  I just wanted to report how well I tolerated the drug without side effects.  Hope this helps someone else.  Good Luck !!",Martin
1,Cefuroxime,Upper Respiratory Tract Infection,8,,"February 27, 2020",10,I've been fighting a bad infection in my sinuses and chest for 3 weeks. I'm on day 2 of this drug and coughing up mucus now and hoping this is normal. I feel a lot better and can breath while lying down. What a relief!,Tee
2,Cefuroxime,Upper Respiratory Tract Infection,1,Taken for less than 1 month,"January 14, 2020",1,"LUPIN manufactured cefuroxime 250 mg tablets are the WORST tasting tablet!!!!!  DO NOT have your pharmacy fill the script if it is manufactured by LUPIN.  When you place the tablet in your mouth (not your tongue), it leaves a bitter aftertaste. It is terrible. I started vomiting.",rxconsumer
3,Cefuroxime,Upper Respiratory Tract Infection,10,,"March 26, 2019",8,"Ceftin (cefuroxime):Very gentle antibiotic for me. With every other kind I've taken, on the first dose, I expect it to feel like it ""hit bottom"" in my stomach. This one did not make my stomach upset one bit. A surprise. Had a cold for 1.5 weeks and it came back a few days later (after some sinus pains) Sinuses opened up and a torrent of mucus poured down my throat, caused laryngitis. was getting worse so I decided to suck it up and take these. I was VERY apprehensive at first because I think antibiotics should be a last resort. I have a trip abroad coming up so, no time to be sick. Started working the day I took it. It is now day 4 on them and  my voice came back. I've been sipping kefir and taking a probiotic between doses. I don't know if this will cause a yeast infection, but I still might take a fluconazole after my prescription is finished if I feel ANY hint of discomfort. So far so good though. Penicillins usually give me instant vaginal yeast infections!Cleared my cystic acne too!",Osama Yomama
4,Cefuroxime,Upper Respiratory Tract Infection,10,,"April 24, 2018",6,I had the worst case of tonsillitis (pain and swelling had me in tears) cough green mucus red eyes and a terrible flu and upper respiratory tract infection with cough. I had been to the ER several times to no avail because they kept saying it was viral. I went to the ER a third time and the doctor that time prescribed me this medication that saved me. Penicillin did nothing for me but this medicine worked. Bad taste and diarrhea were my side effects for 7 days.,Qtpie

7,Cefuroxime,Upper Respiratory Tract Infection,9,Taken for less than 1 month,"December 28, 2014",50,"Ceftin (cefuroxime):I'm currently being treated (with Ceftin) for a chest infection. I had been coughing & try as I might, couldn't bring up all the stuck mucous in my chest & throat. After one pill, the phlegm was loosened & there was a dramatic decrease in my coughing. Plus, I've had ZERO side effects!   : )",Priscilla Dearing
8,Cefuroxime,Upper Respiratory Tract Infection,10,Taken for less than 1 month,"October 22, 2014",28,"Prescribed to me for 14 days for a sinus, throat and lung infection that I was battling for 4 weeks without any relief through natural home remedies. Started to unclog the sinus within 72 hours, and began to be able to clear nose and chest through productive cough and sniffing inward to expel the phlegm. Drink plenty of water and eat/drink plenty of probiotic yogurt to avoid the associated diarrhea and stomach issues that can start. Works great. Found it better than Levaquin and without the severe tendon pain/ripping that was caused in my calves when sleeping. ",The Big Irish Guy
