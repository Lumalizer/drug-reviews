0,Clarithromycin,Upper Respiratory Tract Infection,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"March 18, 2022",0,"I've never written a review on a medication before but felt it was important to share my experience. I was prescribed this despite suffering from anxiety and it was the worst experience of my life. I became agitated, more anxious and had suicidal ideation. I got a second opinion from another GP who said it should not have been prescribed to me and took me off it. I would not recommend this medication for anyone with anxiety and being honest, not for anyone at all. Looking at the other reviews, it has caused psychosis in people who never had mental health issues prior to taking it. There are also clinical papers on this. As somebody else said in another review RUN from this medication.",Lorraine

I hate the taste it leaves in my mouth, tastes like when you throw up but it’s just acid/bile it’s horrible.  Overall after already doing one course of antibiotics (doxycycline) and it didn’t work, clarithromycin is definitely doing its job.",amber
4,Clarithromycin,Upper Respiratory Tract Infection,,Taken for less than 1 month,"July 20, 2021",0,"Part1:Well, after reading all these comments I’m perplexed by the many complaints about this antibiotic’s side effects. Always take them with a full 8 oz glass of water on top of the meal. Also, antibiotics get rid of bacteria, they don’t discriminate against the good gut bacteria, so yes you might get diarrhea.. eat plenty of yogurt ( plain Greek yogurt, no sugars or preserved fruit in the bottom) or have probiotics while taking antibiotics.",LadyR

I know it's all very individual but I have never had such strong side effects for a antibiotic (I avoid taking such in general). It seems to be working, though very slow and perhaps I would have improved without taking it.  However, I have terrible insomnia, waves of nasty feelings of despair, anxiety, dizziness, constant fatigue and needles in my limbs. I think the side effects of this drug are worse than the infection it is supposed to cure. Perhaps it's just me, don't know.",Hans Castorp

Within hours of taking the first tablet I had extreme stomach pain, heartburn and diarrhoea. I figured I need to line my stomach next time and this helped a bit.

I phoned for advice and was told to attend the city hospitals emergency department  (I live in the uk incidentally). By the time I got there and was seen it was a while since my last dose and my symptoms were easing a little. The doctor seemed a little sceptical that they were caused by the clarithromycin but he was kind and prescribed me an alternative which worked well.

18,Clarithromycin,Upper Respiratory Tract Infection,8.0,,"July 18, 2019",16,"I went back to the doctor and she prescribed me ""Clacee"" 500mg which is Clarithromycin for 5 days taking two tablets daily and Prednisone 40mg per day for 5 days, because I had a secondary infection that was caused by the flu. I am now on day 3 of the antibiotics with 5 tablets left to go. I can honestly say I got side effects of the antibiotics such as the bitter taste ( which is not that bad only stays for a few hours), nausea (only in the morning and not as bad) and a loose stool once a day. For me honestly the side effects aren't that bad and it my chest feels better already on the third day. I would rather live with the side effects (which is really not that bad) than get even more sick and end up in hospital. I would also recommend you take probiotics while on the antibiotics a few hours after you have taken the antibiotics and eat yogurt during the day as well as they help restore the ""healthy"" bacteria in your gut as well.

I had to adjust or discontinue 3 other meds while taking this antibiotic, to insure my heart would not race for no reason, and it has not. But I do experience cramps and diarrhea but found Omeprazole handled those horrid side effects ange and citrus juice helps with that greatly with the metallic taste in my mouth.

This medicine will give you a horrible taste in your mouth, will cause nausea even when taking it on a full stomach or feel the nausea to extreme levels/vomit, dizziness, and cause diarrhoea until your course is finished. You will also lose your appetite and will have to take repeated prescriptions of this medication for God knows how long just to get rid of any infection whether simple or complex.

My guess is most people that do not have a problem with this antibiotic do not post.  This is my antibiotic of choice.  I do not get any of the side effects and never had anything but positive results over the years.  Be reasonable - discuss it with your doctor and a pharmacist on what most patient responses are to this drug.  Personally I've never asked because it works great for me.,Asthma-Sufferer

I had diarrhoea for the 1st 2 days and an awful taste in my mouth like shampoo with metal filings in it. I started to take acidophilus lactobacilus on day 2 and that sorted my stomach problem. The taste however was very difficult to mask. I found that chocolate of all things helped to keep it at bay for a good few hours. But feeling ill I didn't really feel like eating chocolate. On the whole is it now day 4 and  I am starting to feel an improvement in my health. So something positive has come out of taking them.

The after taste at the back of your mouth  is extremely vile. I can taste it a few hours after taking it. It's that vile the taste wakes me up..I try to swish it away with water but it's still there. The last tablet I took was 10 hours ago the taste my mouth is still dreadful. Not sure whether this medication is helping as still coughing like a trooper. I was less anxious when I read on this thread that it wasn't  me going crazy and others suffered from heart palpitations, shortness of breath, tight chest and anxiety (I can't break thoughts).  Its a dreadful feeling, have to finish the course but will never be taking this med again- 5 more days to go :-/","Joan chance, U.K."

I don't want to take them again.  I want to have a natural alternative next time, it does feel like a toxic drug, very unpleasant but sorry for those with the other dreadful side effects.",coughingjojo

However, side effects are so debilitating, I'd rather be ill!  Aside from the bitter taste, I'm suffering extreme vertigo and cannot keep any food down at all. I'm going to half the dosage and phone the Dr tomorrow to change to another antibiotic.",Kate17

The only side effect is the taste in my mouth in the morning but that is tolerable.  I am so happy that is worked and that I feel better.,Mungle8

Un steadiness . The worse S/e s were the awful feelings of fear which were out of proportion . I felt as if I was about to faint because of the anxiety . I felt very upset and tearful about half an hour after taking them and the mental symptoms just escalated for a few hours . I will report these side effects to the GP and hopefully there is an alternative if I ever need A/b s again for a severe chest infection .",F77ms

I ended up not having any.  I was prescribed Augmentin first for my upper resp infection/ear infection and it didn't work at all.  I took some advice from a nurse where I work about how to take the Biaxin.  I ate my meal first, then ate about 3 small pieces of dark chocolate and took the pill after that.  Let me tell you the dark chocolate is a miracle worker.  One time I ate chocolate after I took the pill and I got the nasty metal taste.  It is TERRIBLE and you can't get rid of it for hours.  So, remember...DARK chocolate BEFORE the pill.",Anonymous
