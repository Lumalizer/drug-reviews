0,Doxycycline,Upper Respiratory Tract Infection,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"March 29, 2022",0,I have had six chest infections in 9 months and coughed and brought up phlegm for years and years on a daily basis. One course of this medication has somehow managed to stop my coughing and phlegm production almost completely. Side effects were diarrhoea quite bad however to have almost no coughing etc I would say this medication was pretty amazing  Thank you,Cleo

4,Doxycycline,Upper Respiratory Tract Infection,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"September 6, 2021",0,"Doryx is personally my super antibiotic drug. I suffer from upper respiratory infections often, I also suffer from asthma and have difficulty breathing when suffering chest infections. The only antibiotic that works for me is Doryx. I have tried amoxicillin and other penicillin drugs but they do not help with my respiratory condition like Doryx does.I had a flu vaccine a few years ago to prevent myself getting the flu, but instead I got so sick from the flu vaccine I started wheezing, my chest was so tight and I had severe body cramps, I could not walk without losing my breathe. The only drug that saved me was Doryx. Within 3 days of taking Doryx I was feeling much better and my body pains went away. I have never had any bad side effects, only slight nausea if I take it in the morning without food in my stomach and if I take it right before bed I can suffer from heartburn.",Kerrie

Still coughing so hard I'm pulling muscles in my chest, but now I also have to deal with the horrible side effects (crippling anxiety that keeps me awake all night, zapping/twitching throughout my body,  depression, nausea, unable to eat, exhaustion, confusion, racing heart beat). It has been a complete nightmare, I feel like I'm on death's doorstep. I guess I'll have to try something else tomorrow when I'm done this horrible medicine, since it did nothing except make things much much worse.",Sickasadog
6,Doxycycline,Upper Respiratory Tract Infection,8.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"April 7, 2021",5,I have repeated chest infections so I have been  taking these for 5 to 6 weeks  for 18 months.  I get treated for asthma on 3 inhaler get put on antibiotics  amoxisilon  but I realise that never worked. I would be put on doxycycline and they worked but I still get chest infections every 5 to 6 weeks.  It is draining me but I get put on doxycycline and steroids and it helps me at the time. I spoke to GP regarding different antibiotics I said I did notice that doxycycline is definitely the best on for me. Still no answers why I am having repeated chest infection.  It is so wearing me down  any ideas out there I am 63 women,Ziggy
7,Doxycycline,Upper Respiratory Tract Infection,10.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"September 30, 2020",33,Been poorly for 4 weeks I have COPD & usually have a rescue pack containing steroids & doxycycline with all this covid about docs wouldn’t give me rescue pack until I got covid test which came back negative. So it was nearly a week into being poorly I finally got doxycycline but no steroids. They cleared my upper tract infection but days later it came back so docs have now finally given me steroids & more doxycycline but a ten day course instead of seven days. I’m praying I finally get rid of this nasty infection as I feel so drained . Think the moral of my story if I had rescue pack in at the start of infection I wouldn’t have been as poorly as I have been I’ve always had rescue pack at hand for my COPD of steroids & doxcycline & felt better soon after taking them Amoxcillin didn’t help at all,Vonnie

12,Doxycycline,Upper Respiratory Tract Infection,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"January 25, 2020",47,"This doxycycline is the only antibiotic that works almost immediately when I get a sinus infection. I had my first sinus infection about 2 years ago, was prescribed amoxicillin and was absolutely miserable while sick and this didn't even touch it. Went back to the Dr about a week later, still feeling awful with all the normal respiratory symptoms and was then put on doxycycline. It started to work very quickly and I don't remember experiencing any side effects. Fast forward to now when I started experiencing the same symptoms of this last sinus infection from 2 years ago (facial pain, runny nose, headache, sore throat) and immediately made an appointment with my Dr who prescribed doxycycline, as it worked so well before. Again, this started working almost immediately and the symptoms started subsiding. This is a wonder drug in my opinion and I highly recommend!!",Stella

14,Doxycycline,Upper Respiratory Tract Infection,9.0,,"December 7, 2019",54,"doxycycline is a very good antibiotic which is very effective. Was given this for a sinus infection that has failed to clear after amoxicillin. Have had it previously so I am aware of the potential nasty side effects. Can make you extremely nauseous if not taken with an adequate meal and plenty of water. As with other antibiotics can upset your stomach and give you diarrhoea. The cons have to be weighed against the pros though, as ultimately recovering from a bacterial infection is priority. I can handle upset stomach, nausea and headaches if it an antibiotic is effective in treating the infection. You will ultimately recover from those but the infection could be the end of you if left to run its course. No drug is without side effects and this should be taken into consideration. People drink alcohol and look what that does to you",Anonymous

I've taken doxy after tick-bites about 4 times in my 52 years on Earth. 2 of those times were preventative, the other 2 times I already was infected (Erythema migrans was clearly visible).I can't say enough good about this antibiotic. You just have to not take it on an empty stomach. The negative reviews to me seem like whining, and blaming doxy for something it is not even responsible for. I've decided to take it this week (in 2018) when I was coughing for 2 weeks and had flu-like symptoms even after having been vaccinated against flu. This worked wonders. I had only taken 2 x 100 mg doxy, and the entire thing was over the next day. This is an absolute killer antibiotic.
