0,Azithromycin,Upper Respiratory Tract Infection,9.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"February 27, 2022",0,Works great after my virus is gone but I still have heavy lung congestion. If you have thick yellow phlegm it might be time to use zpak. It will cure bacterial phlegm not viral phlegm. I only had it fail one time.... I probably took it too soon and the virus was still in charge and hadn't turned bacterial. Then they gave me Leviquin antibiotic of l last resort for anthrax. That screws up people tendons and knees. Did it to me. Trash,Anonymous

I'm allergic to penicillin, so this is my go-to for this type of sinus stuff. A word of the wise: YOGURT, KEFIR, PROBIOTICS. This will help you avoid all the terrible stomach cramps/diarrhea and potentially C.Diff or yeast infection. If you get yeast infections frequently with antibiotics, ask your doc to throw in a prescription for Diflucan.

This has happened before in the past but I was either prescribed an over-the-counter cough suppressant or I just left it alone until the problem went away by itself (usually took a couple of months). I went to a different doctor this time and she prescribed me the 5 day pack (two pills on the first day, and one pill per day for the next four days). The double dosage gave me the worse stomach cramps and diarrhea for two to three hours, and the single dosages gave me bad stomach cramps and diarrhea for an hour. My cough is still there, but it has gotten a bit better (although this could also be due to time). However, 13 days after I started taking it, I suddenly have a bad rash on the front of my neck.
