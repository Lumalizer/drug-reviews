1,Zithromax,Upper Respiratory Tract Infection,9,Taken for less than 1 month,"September 2, 2019",17,"Waited 10 days to go to the doctor thinking I had bronchitis! I wish I would’ve went to the doctor sooner because I was miserable coughing my head off with phlegm, terrible headaches, fatigue, congestion, and sweats. I ended up having and upper respiratory infection and was given a z pack. After day one I felt soooo much better and was ready to go back to work. I am on day 4 and still coughing up infection, hoping that’s ends soon! Also everyday after I take the pill I get some pretty bad abdominal pain and have to run to the bathroom but only lasting about an hour. I would say the stomach ache is definitely worth it!",Funkmeister

8,Zithromax,Upper Respiratory Tract Infection,10,,"September 8, 2011",75,I have been using Zithromax for the past 6 years to fight off my upper respiratory tract infections.  I have tried almost everything else in the military medical inventory to win against the URI's I get yearly (every Sept/Oct Time frame) but Zithromax wins hands down every time.Does not matter during which stage of the URI you begin to take the medicine.  The first or second night you will start to fight the infection hardcore and you might notice a fever develop as your body fights against the bacteria.  After that its smooth sailing so you feel better by the 3rd day and completely cured by the 5th day.It is definitely a wonder drug and worth the extra money.,Anonymous

11,Zithromax,Upper Respiratory Tract Infection,10,,"May 2, 2010",45,This medicine is the best. I have been using this medicine about once every year for upper respiratory tract infections. It really starts to work by day 2 and continues to work after about a week.  As with any medicine the side effects with me is going to the restroom more than usual.  ,Wolfman627
