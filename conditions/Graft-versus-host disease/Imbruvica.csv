0,Imbruvica,Graft-versus-host disease,7,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"December 7, 2018",1,"Started Ibrutinib (Imbruvica) on 22/10/2018 (7 wks ago) for cGVHD (Chronic graft-versus-host disease) arising from  stemcell transplantation (SCT) (matching female sibling) in 2014 to treat  Mantle cell lymphoma (MCL). cGVHD (skin, eyes, mouth & subcutaneous tissue resistant to front line treatment (Mycrophenolate & predinsoline - ave dose 20mg).  Experienced quite severe diarrhoea after 2 days. Resolved after 5 weeks after taking loperamide, which is no longer required.  Also experienced increased fatigue and maybe slightly more cramping (was already getting some cramps which is common for cGVHD). Immunoglobin levels have dropped will require an infusion. Some early signs that skin symptoms ie scleroderma might be reducing.  However too early to tell effectiveness, suspect will be another 30-60 days before start to see if going to have impact",GGL
1,Imbruvica,Graft-versus-host disease,8,,"January 9, 2018",6,"About me: AML, stem cell transplant survivor with GVHD. How Imbruvica helped:  I started imbruvica in 4/17. Prior to taking it I was completely debilitated. After 4 full months on the drug I noted marked improvement. Now I am able to walk, light lifting, and carry out regular activity with much less fatigue and pain. My skin GVHD is not showing any symptoms. It's been a god send! Side effects: I noticed cramping at about 5 months and back & joint pain at 8 months. The cramping became severe however it is managed well with tonic water. The pain is extreme at times - but so far outweighs the GVHD symptoms.",Mfirmes
