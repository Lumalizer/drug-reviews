0,Zithromax,TonsillitisPharyngitis,9,,"December 3, 2017",19,"This is the only antibiotic that ever works for me. Whenever I have a cold and the Dr claims it is viral, it always goes to my tonsils. This time I waited 7 days suffering fever and a throat so sore I could not swallow, and eventually went to the pharmacist and asked for Zithromax z pak. Within 1 day I was 80 percent healed. No side effects. It works for me everyntime. By day 2, all sinus congestion had gone and I got my first real sleep in two weeks.",Matthm

After the second day, the medication reduced the swelling and throat pain, but began to cause stomach cramping and pain.  By the end of the third day the stomach pain was severe and Doctor recommended to discontinue use.  This is the only antibiotic I have used that has caused an allergic reaction.",scaryfencer
