6,Amoxicillin,TonsillitisPharyngitis,,Taken for less than 1 month,"January 12, 2020",18,I was prescribed amoxicillin 1000 mg tablets to be taken twice daily after meals for acute pharyngitis in my throat. The infection started out on my tonsils and I was initially prescribed a betadine spray. Used the spray every four hours for two weeks with no real effect. Went back to the ENT and was told the infection had moved further down my throat. I’m on my fifth day of a ten day dose of amoxicillin and it’s feeling better finally. I should also mention that I had 35 radiation doses and two chemo infusions a few months ago for base of tongue cancer. The cancer is in remission but my throat is still damaged but slowly healing from the radiation. The ENT doc mentioned that I was more susceptible to infections due to the radiation treatment. I get my throat scoped by an ENT doc every 30 days to monitor healing and make sure the cancer isn’t returning.,Mike

10,Amoxicillin,TonsillitisPharyngitis,3.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"March 9, 2018",6,"My 9 year old took this medicine for tonsilitis, she developed the rash after 5 days. It was the worst and still continues. It has been 3 days since not taking the meds and the rash is still there but at least we now see signs of it going away. I heard the rash develops because it take too much good bacteria out of your system, so I gave her a probiotic smoothie in the morning and also yogurt with fruit. Strawberries, mangoes and oranges are really good.  I also put lavender, rose and blue tansy essential oils on her chest, top of feet and 3rd eye - not a rub just a spot. They are really good for calming. I also made her drink tons of water to flush it out of her system. This was the most difficult experience, I wish there were better antibiotics out there or that I knew beforehand what this drug could do.","got ""the"" rash"

I had tried the z-pak in the past, but it gave me bad side effects so we switched to the amoxicillin. It started working within 24 hours for me. I had experienced slight diarrhea in the past with this antibiotic, but my doctor gave me Align Probiotic Supplements to replace the good bacteria that antibiotics tend to destroy along with the bad bacteria, which is what causes the gut problems. Worked amazing! No diarrhea! The amoxicillin does make me feel a bit sleepy..I napped a lot the first few days.

I have had chronic tonsillitis for few years and each time only this antibiotic can help. The symptom relief comes relatively slowly (after 2-3 days) compared to just 1 day after taking macrolide antibiotics (Clarithomycin, Spiramycin, Azithromycin, etc).
