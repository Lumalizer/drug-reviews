0,Azithromycin,TonsillitisPharyngitis,10.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"February 6, 2022",0,"I have used zpack 250 mg pack (double the dose - first day 500mg). I always make sure to have some carbs before I take it such as crackers or bread as directions mention. I’ve taken it now 3X in my life and never have had any stomach issues with it. I’m only 90 lbs and terrified of vomiting and have an extreme phobia so I had a lot of anxiety before taking it. The stress and anxiety of my throat condition and along with fears of having to take this pill caused me nausea and soft stool, but NOT the actual zpack itself! I prepared by taking a very small dose of Imodium hours before taking my first dose and I will say this probably helped my nerves and tummy to withstand the zpack with ease. Honestly, your conditions may be so severe that the body just embraces the first dose. Every single time I took it, I felt a boost of energy and relieved! Not gonna lie, I felt like a million bucks, like my army was winning! You’ll feel an immediate difference, I promise. Think good thoughts!",not gonna puke

Negative for both. Suffered for 2 more days before going to my regular doctor who promptly put me on a 5-day Azithromycin regimen. I started feeling better the next day and throat pain was pretty much gone by Day 4. I did have some diarrhea which I addressed with partial success by consuming yogurt/probiotics a few hours after taking my dose.

I was prescribed it  by a doctor and I had no qualms about it since I'm also a healthcare professional and I haven't really had any bad encounters with it of my patients complaining about serious side effects of the drug. A day after I had taken it, weird itchy pimple-like rashes started popping out on my T-zone. I stopped the meds when I realized that I was experiencing a delayed hypersensitivity reaction to the drug. I went back to the same doctor who advised me to stop taking the drug and prescribed me an antihistamine. It's been 3 days already and I don't see my skin getting better anytime soon. It's so itchy and scaly. My esteem has dipped since getting this rash on my face because I've always had really clear skin. I would not recommend this drug at all....",Me

Dr prescribed the z-pack. Now I'm on 3rd day and feeling much better - the pain and swelling have reduced significantly.For those who are suffering from viral and getting the throat swab negative, I think they cannot expect positive effect of azithromycin or any other antibiotic, as antibiotics are not for viral infection and in such cases antibiotics may only help in preventing secondary bacterial infection. It may also not show significant improvement for those whose bacteria is azithromycin resistant.I had taken levofloxacin and had adverse side effects - Achilles' tendon problem and peripheral neuropathy.

The next day I took one pill, and had no side effects. I am on my third day and had pains, similar to harsh period cramps and then diarrhea also within two hours.

27,Azithromycin,TonsillitisPharyngitis,8.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"January 20, 2017",5,"The secret of taking any antibiotics is full-stomach.  Meaning, you should eat a full meal even you don't have an appetite.  A bowl of rice, soup, pooridge, noodles, banana, oatmeal, peanut butter sandwich with honey, or anything you can eat. Full stomach before you take the medicine (in fact any kind of medicine even vitamins) is a key to not feel all the side effects.  Also, if you feel too much side effects (nausea, vomiting, dizziness), you may be allergic to one content of the medicine you are taking.  You should check on it!  Like, I usually get Augmentin for my tonsils and ear infection but I constantly getting the same side effects when I take it then I found out I was allergic to pennicilin content.",Tappingfeet
