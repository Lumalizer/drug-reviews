1,Cefuroxime,TonsillitisPharyngitis,9.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"January 7, 2019",10,"I had tonsillitis, sinus and ear infections.  After being sick for a week I could barely swallow or turn my head due to throat pain.  Doctor prescribed Cefuroxime 500mg twice/day for 10 days. I was nervous about all the side effects listed because I usually get them all, however, I had no side effects accept for mild itching from this medication.  My throat and ears started feeling better after a few days and the headache was much improved by 5 days.  I made sure to eat just before taking the pill and always took it with milk.  I have several autoimmune diseases and take a probiotic daily.  Maybe these things helped me not to have the side effects.  I would definitely take this again,  if necessary.",Runnergirl
2,Cefuroxime,TonsillitisPharyngitis,9.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"July 4, 2013",29,"Ceftin (cefuroxime):I have infections in the sinus, throat and upper chest.  My doctor first put me on Augmentin, which caused me to throw up. She changed it to Ceftin, and it is giving me no trouble at all. Also, I am already feeling better in the sinus. I have a horrible cough, but I imagine that's from the bronchitis breaking up. I'm very pleased with how this is working so far.",amberpep
3,Cefuroxime,TonsillitisPharyngitis,9.0,,"June 10, 2011",20,Ceftin (cefuroxime):It quickly helped get rid of the infection in my throat BUT it is very hard to take. The taste of the pill is horrible and sticks around for a long time in the back of your throat. I used flavored yogurt to help counteract the flavor after I swallowed the pill. It also starts dissolving quickly so it tended to get stuck in my throat.,Anonymous
