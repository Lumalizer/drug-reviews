0,Cefdinir,TonsillitisPharyngitis,3,,"July 7, 2021",0,"I had a nasty throat infection and was prescribed this.  It cleared my condition up in a few days but it gave me horrible anxiety/anger episodes.  Plus I could only sleep 3-4 hours a night.  If you have anxiety issues and are allergic to penicillin, please try another antibiotic.  This one is pretty rough.  It also made my legs itch and gave me weird pains in my legs.",DWR
1,Cefdinir,TonsillitisPharyngitis,1,Taken for less than 1 month,"July 30, 2019",8,"Prescribed this drug because of history of MONO with tonsillitis. I was very reluctant to take it, but went ahead anyway. Besides the pill smelling like death, 4 days into it I was better, and expedited extremely bad cramps / diarrhea and bloating. I mistakenly took another dosage and was filled with hives all over. Still dealing with the second day of hives, the ER gave me 5 days of steroids. Iâ€™ve been on tons of antibiotic for recurring strep/tonsillitis and have NEVER experienced something like this.",Chris
2,Cefdinir,TonsillitisPharyngitis,1,Taken for less than 1 month,"February 14, 2019",3,"Side affect still lasting after 10 days off med. Itchy rash, swollen neck, chest, face, tongue, headache, fatigue, on and off diarrhea.  Increased urination. Feel terrible for weeks. Took 2 a day for 10 days.Don't recommend this at all",Banks
3,Cefdinir,TonsillitisPharyngitis,1,Taken for less than 1 month,"May 10, 2018",1,"I regret allowing this to be prescribed for my 17 year old son. He normally takes Zithromax for respiratory infections, but he was seeing a new/different provider. She wanted to give him this. After a total of 4 doses, he was NO better, not even slightly. I understand drugs need time to work, but I almost think he worsened a bit on this. And then, after the 4th dose, he developed diarrhea. This is hard for a busy high school student. I had been carefully giving him probiotics also but that did not help. The dr's office is switching him back to Zithromax.",Oedgar
4,Cefdinir,TonsillitisPharyngitis,2,,"March 2, 2018",0,Our 12 year old was given this for his tonsillitis and he has seen no reprieve whatsoever. He has actually gotten worse. He was checked for strep and two strains of the flu so I'm assuming the doctor gave him the right medicine however he was not checked for the third strain of flu that is going  around.Feeling sad to see my boy feeling worse. Probably need  to go back to the Doc.,Mamashell
5,Cefdinir,TonsillitisPharyngitis,3,,"January 13, 2017",2,"I'll give it credit that it did make me feel better - but the cost was a very upset stomach. I've never had issues with antibiotics upsetting my stomach before, but this medicine gave me really bad diarrhea one day after starting it. Still not over the diarrhea after almost a week off the medicine. Obviously everyone reacts different, but I won't be using this medicine again.",nashtowntn
6,Cefdinir,TonsillitisPharyngitis,1,Taken for less than 1 month,"March 1, 2016",5,"After 3 days of taking this medication I was suffering from constant gastrointestinal issues, which is something I have never experienced on antibiotics before even with probiotics. On day 4 I began with severe itching, burning, and hives and returned to the doctor. This antibiotic also seemed to have little affect on my original illness. I am now on a Z pack and feel much better. Now I have to be on a long course of Prednisone for my allergic reaction which has yet to subside. This by far has been the worst antibiotic I have ever taken in my life. Never ever again!",Anonymous

8,Cefdinir,TonsillitisPharyngitis,10,Taken for less than 1 month,"June 18, 2015",8,Omnicef (cefdinir):I get tonsilitis every year and recently I decided to go to the doctor to get some antibiotics. He prescribed me cefdinir and It worked great my tonsils cleared up but there is only problem. The side effects. I decided to not go the full 10 days and stopped using it after a week. I developed horrible vaginal itching as well as diarrhea which lead to blood in my stool. This medication did the job but I don't think I would ever take it again. Hopefully since I stopped this medication these side effects will go away soon.,Anonymous
