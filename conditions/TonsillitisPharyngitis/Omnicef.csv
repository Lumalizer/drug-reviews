0,Omnicef,TonsillitisPharyngitis,10,Taken for less than 1 month,"June 18, 2015",8,I get tonsilitis every year and recently I decided to go to the doctor to get some antibiotics. He prescribed me cefdinir and It worked great my tonsils cleared up but there is only problem. The side effects. I decided to not go the full 10 days and stopped using it after a week. I developed horrible vaginal itching as well as diarrhea which lead to blood in my stool. This medication did the job but I don't think I would ever take it again. Hopefully since I stopped this medication these side effects will go away soon.,Anonymous
