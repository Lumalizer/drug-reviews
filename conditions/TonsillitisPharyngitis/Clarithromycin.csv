0,Clarithromycin,TonsillitisPharyngitis,3.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"December 8, 2021",0,"I don't recommend this drug, personally. My doctor wouldn't see me, due to COVID and despite my listed symptoms swaying me towards Tonsillitis, my doctor seemed adamant I had an ear infection. So we compromised and I took this, as it treats both. It's a large pill to swallow, you do wake in the night with a dry metallic taste and it upsets your stomach; but my major gripe was that I ended up giving me not one, but two ear infections in the short window of 48 hours. It did get rid of my Tonsillitis and for the shortest five hours I had relief, but that was quickly replaced with an ear infection on the opposing side. Then after spending the night draining my right ear and sitting upright to avoid the pain, I then had to go through that AGAIN on the third night in my left ear, where my tonsillitis had originated. I feel like if my doctor had just seen me to confirm or taken my assumption as more accurate, I'd have been on Amoxicillin and this wouldn't have happened.",Anonymous

It does the job and gets rid of infections and if you're allergic to penicillin, then you don't have much choice!Sure the metallic taste in the mouth is deeply unpleasant, the nausea can be avoided by not taking on an empty stomach (although when it hits..bleurgh), and the insomnia isn't all that fun. But I  only have to take it for a max of 10 days, all of this is manageable and far more bearable than its counterpart Erythromycin which ruined my Christmas dinner and Penicillin which I'm allergic to.500mg x2 per day.",AMUK

3,Clarithromycin,TonsillitisPharyngitis,9.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"July 4, 2021",3,"Allergic to penicillin so was given Clarithromycin 500mg for tonsillitis, I was given 5 day course.  After first couple of tabs throat eased and I never slept as much. Horrible taste in my mouth which nothing would get rid of, I was very windy, diarrhea, feeling hungry even after eating a meal, feeling hot a lot and headache at the back of my head. However the last day of taking these and I couldn't get to sleep.  The pain I was in with the tonsillitis  was unbearable so the side effects are a small price to pay. Hopefully the bad taste won't take long to go away",Fletch
4,Clarithromycin,TonsillitisPharyngitis,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"February 5, 2021",0,"This was my 3rd antibiotic after having completed amoxicillin twice and the infection didn’t want to go away. With this tab I only took 1 tablet out of the 7 day course, it was that bad! I started shaking after 30 mins of having this tablet and then later the symptoms kicked in- bad headaches, nausea, weird stomach aches, bitter taste in my mouth, heavy breathing. That evening my heart started to beating quiet fast but luckily it didn’t last long and through out the night the symptoms settled. Also I couldn’t much sleep that night, I was extremely tired my eyes were closing but my body didn’t want to sleep. When I woke up the next day I felt slight heavy breathing, then through out the day I felt the reaction had stopped and the symptoms of the infection started. I called up the doc and they told me I had a reaction and it’s good that I stopped. Now I’ve been given co amoxiclav.",Yaz

Sore throat resolved with the first 1 -2 doses. But the side effects so far on Day 2 are harrowing. Constant bad (metallic) taste in my mouth, constant burning in stomach, and now horrendous stomach cramps that make me curl up in a ball.

He said I must take it for 7 days. Everything was fine up until day 5 when the side effects kicked in,  just after taking my evening dose. When I went to bed, I started feeling weird, I was randomly jumpy, seeing a flash of light but when I rubbed my eyes it went, I had insomnia, feeling like a panic attack will start, and when I got up out of the bed I felt dizzy. Luckily it started towards the end of my course so I didn’t have to go through that for too long. It was horrible!!

Being a hypochondriac, I started them yesterday but I only took half a pill though I was supposed to take a full one- no side affects. Today, I took a full pill as directed & it has now been almost 7 hours and I still have absolutely no side affects! The only thing I’ve notified even the slightest is a very, very mild headache that doesn’t even last long. I see some people said it wasn’t bad until day 3 but we will see. Regardless, don’t believe the things you see until you try it for yourself! It is scary and you never know with new medicines but the benefit of the medicine is I’m sure far better than dealing with the pain of whatever you have going on. Take the medicine; GET BETTER.

I did experience the metallic taste after each dose and I would wake up feeling lethargic the first few days. However, after day 3 I started getting bad heart palpitations that would keep me up at night - I didn’t sleep for 2 days! Day 4 I was a mess, my anxiety sky rocketed and I was very and paranoid and still had the heart palpitations. After calling 111 I was advised to stop taking the drug and to never take it again. I visited an OOH Dr the next day and I was put on 2 different antibiotics. Dr said my tonsils and glands were still so swollen and irritated despite being on Clarithromcyin for 4 days. The side effects wore off 1-2 days after stopping Clarithromcyin. Please speak to a doctor ASAP if you have any sort of bad reaction to this drug as it is a very strong and harsh antibiotic.

I was given the liquid form of two 5ml doses a day. After just two days I can swallow pain free, breathe and my tonsills and swelling have significantly reduced. Which is amazing considering I was hospitalised just two days before! My body feels completely fine. The only side effects I get are the horrible after taste (which kinda taste like you filled a metal bath with bleach and deodorant, washed it out with dish washer soap then licked the whole bath rim) - which only lasts around half an hour max, which I always mask with a fruity ice pop (not sure why it just seems to work!) I've also vomited a few times but that could also be down to the phlegm which makes me gag ( . I also gave up smoking so double as phlegmy these days) and force feeding myself.

I'm terrified of the long list of sides effects on most medicines, but I've had this 3 times before for various conditions and it hasn't killed me. It works really well but it's so important that you keep taking it for the full duration. It usually starts working in  2- 3 days. As for side effects, I always get the metallic taste (I don't know why they list this as an uncommon side effect instead of common) as well as stomach pains and nausea. Never had diarrhea from it. My advice would be to take food with it or 30 mins before, and sit/stand for the next few hours. When you lie down, the symptoms are much worse, especially the nausea, cramps & metallic taste.",Jim247
