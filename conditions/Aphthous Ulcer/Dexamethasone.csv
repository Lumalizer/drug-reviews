0,Dexamethasone,Aphthous Ulcer,9,,"April 4, 2010",7,"Really did a great job in reducing inflammation caused by mouth sores, but had  significant difficulties sleeping. Was given 10 mg IV weekly during chemo session, and took 4 mg twice daily afterward, for about one month. Stopped taking on a Wednesday (cold turkey) and by Saturday was experiencing edginess, some depression. Took until Sunday evening to really get back into a positive attitude. Probably should have told doctor that I wanted to phase out. It really works, but be watchful of mood swings.",stlouisjoe
