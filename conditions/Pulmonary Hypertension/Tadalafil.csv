0,Tadalafil,Pulmonary Hypertension,10,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"February 8, 2022",0,"Tadalafil over Sildenafil when teamed up with Ambrisentan. Sildenafil was the first med they prescribed for my PAH. My test results and the way I was feeling just wasn't cutting it. So I got switched to Tadalafil and things improved after a couple weeks. Now I'm 40 year's old at the time. High blood pressure, heart failure, low EF, PAH and Heart disease. Heart problems run in my family. I couldn't walk up a flight of steps before Tadalafil without fainting when I got to the top. Also Metoprolol, Lasix, Spironolactone, Lisinopril, omeprazole and daily vitamins. So I have some issues but thanks to Tadalafil I no longer have to sleep in my basement when I forget why I went down there in the first place.",R. Daddy
1,Tadalafil,Pulmonary Hypertension,9,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"August 27, 2021",0,Adcirca (tadalafil):Take adcirca and Opsumit for PAH for 18 months now. Pressures have decreased substantially and heart function dramatically improved. Can't take two drugs at the same time and adcirca must be taken with food and infrequently makes me a little nauseated. Have zofran on hand. Rarely a little light-headed especially during summer heat.,Happy camper
2,Tadalafil,Pulmonary Hypertension,1,Taken for less than 1 month,"March 29, 2019",9,"My experience was not good. Took my first dose on a Friday night and 2 hours later my heart raced and felt shaky for about 4 hours. Saturday night, same thing. Decided to try taking it in the morning instead so waited till Monday morning. Two hours later my throat closed off, was gasping and shaking uncontrollably, almost passed out. Lasted a couple of minutes and subsided and then went the full cycle again. Suffered at least a dozen of those episodes in 4 hours and was hospitalized. I will never take it again as I feel I was lucky to be able to come out of the reaction as well as I have",Pah patient

4,Tadalafil,Pulmonary Hypertension,5,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"February 17, 2015",11,"Adcirca (tadalafil):When I started taking Adcirca for pulmonary hypertension I experienced hallucinations and intense exhaustion. I stayed sleepy; I hardly spent any time awake the first two weeks I took this medication. After the first two weeks of taking Adcirca, the hallucinations and intense sleepiness went away. However, approximately a week after I started taking this medication I began having vivid nightmares and disorientation. I have been taking Adcirca for about two years and still suffer from the nightmares and disorientation. I have also experienced some of the more common side effects, such as; Flushing, Muscle Aches and Dizziness.As for the Pulmonary Hypertension, I have not experienced any noticeable changes.",chemical_88
5,Tadalafil,Pulmonary Hypertension,1,,"January 28, 2015",18,"Adcirca (tadalafil):No change in pulmonary function tests after 3 months, plus severe edema, so I also had to take a strong diuretic that had to be planned so I would not be stranded without a bathroom, lots of peeing for 6 hours.",xenarulz
