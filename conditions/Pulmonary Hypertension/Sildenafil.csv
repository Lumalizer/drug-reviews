1,Sildenafil,Pulmonary Hypertension,10.0,Taken for 5 to 10 years,"July 1, 2020",15,"Revatio (sildenafil):Revatio was prescribed by my Pulmonary doctor for PAH.A miracle drug that helped me breathe better, I was able to exercise and felt great. After changing insurance carriers I am no longer able to get Revatio and I can tell how my body feels lethargic and I have spells of hard to breathe all day long now. Sad but health care and insurance don't go hand in hand to help us that actually need this med as it is extremely expensive. My 90 day supply of 10mg 3 times a day med cost almost 3,000.00 but my co pay was only 60.00. Since I lost that insurance I can no longer get Revatio.",Anonymous
2,Sildenafil,Pulmonary Hypertension,,Taken for 10 years or more,"December 18, 2018",9,"I took Sildenafil (Revatio) for nine years and believe it kept me alive and breathing all that time. My pulmonologist retired in 2015, the new pulmonologist prescribed Adcirca due to it staying in the blood system longer. Now I have been switched to generic Sildenafil, taking one 20MG tab three times a day. I will be checking to see if there is a generic Adcirca.",Peggy
