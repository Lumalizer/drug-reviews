1,Doxycycline,Lyme Disease Neurologic,1,Taken for less than 1 month,"January 7, 2018",4,It was prescribed when my doctor confirmed on 2 tests from the 2 hospitals that I went to for my symptoms. I was prescribed 90 days. I couldn't even keep water down. I threw up several times a day. I was losing more liquid that taking in. I had to stop after 2 weeks of taking it.  Leading me unfortunately to irreversible damage most likely.  My heart palpitates. My joints swell like a 60+ year old (I'm 33) Especially when the temp is very low or the barometric pressure is high.  I have chronic fatigue and many memory issues...,Jill v
2,Doxycycline,Lyme Disease Neurologic,7,,"January 13, 2013",13,"Taking for 3 weeks now for long term Lyme disease. I've gotten nausea 3 times now. When I didn't have food in my stomach is when this has happened.  Also last year I took it in summer and got blisters on my hands and fingers from being out in the sun. I was wearing 75 sunblock on my hands and it didn't help. A week after taking it this year all my lymph nodes got very swollen and it hurt to put my right arm down from armpit lymph node. Also had a headache every day when lymph nodes are swollen. But this is a good sign that my body is trying to kill, flush out the bacteria and toxins.",Justin03
3,Doxycycline,Lyme Disease Neurologic,9,Taken for 5 to 10 years,"October 17, 2012",17,"Doxy 100 (doxycycline):I was on Doxy for over 5 years because ever time I stopped it which you have to periodically, I felt so sick, confusion got worse, memory loss was HORRIBLE & all Lyme symptoms returned immediately. After 5 years my doctor said she could no longer give this to me due to the length I have been on it. It did help me while I was on it.I saw someone ask about a resurgence of Lyme symptoms that her daughter had, YES-ABSOLUTELY---the very first time I was placed on this the same issues happened to me & also if I was off it for more than 3 months to give my body a break it all started up again. I am still experienceing Lyme symptoms & always will, I was told I am at the best I will ever get. I am just grateful that I am no longer in a wheelchair...",msciccone
4,Doxycycline,Lyme Disease Neurologic,10,,"October 14, 2009",12,"I have gotten a tick bite but the ring wasn't distinct enough for the doctor to verify it as Lyme, he prescribed doxycycline for me. It works rather well actually, considering I had an ""possibly incurable"" skin infection in my hands, this drug was the only thing that worked against it. So in the end, it seems that I didn't have Lyme, but all my other infections were cured.",almost had it
5,Doxycycline,Lyme Disease Neurologic,8,,"July 25, 2009",14,Doxy 200 (doxycycline):Had lots of Herxheimer reaction with this drug.,blimy lymey
6,Doxycycline,Lyme Disease Neurologic,5,,"July 20, 2009",13,Doryx (doxycycline):My daughter (16) was prescribed Doryx 150 mg 2 x day for Lyme disease after exhausting all other antibiotics and her symptoms returned. After two doses she started to experience paranoia and anxiety. Could this be herxheimer's reaction meaning it is working (resurgence or original symptoms of Lyme disease) or is this a severe adverse reaction? ,lyme mom
7,Doxycycline,Lyme Disease Neurologic,9,,"May 29, 2009",11,Doryx (doxycycline):Doryx 150mg tablets very well tolerated - minimal gastrointestinal disturbance which could be alleviated by taking a good pro-biotic.,Anonymous
