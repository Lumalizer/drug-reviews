0,Rocephin,Lyme Disease Neurologic,8.0,,"January 15, 2021",3,"Like others I was misdiagnosed, for me it was 25 years!  I started slowly with other antibiotics and anti malaria for babesia , TBRF and Lyme When I finally started injecting Rocephin. I felt amazing afterwards.   Some days not so much... but like other comments it’s made a big difference.  My stomach feels amazing and my joints stopped throbbing (in AM... still tired at the end of the day).  And neck was looser and bones feel better    I already removed my GB ..hoping to get rid of an odd side pain , so that’s not an issue for me.   Hoping the effects last.  May switch over to disulfiram eventually.  Good luck all..we can get better step by step hopefully!  With nothing but love for my fellow sufferers!",JJ two times
1,Rocephin,Lyme Disease Neurologic,8.0,,"October 12, 2017",14,"I had Lyme disease, misdiagnosed and untreated, for 12 years.  By the time the wise doctor sent me out for a blood test, I was basically a vegetable.  I have gone from a high-performing, athletic lifestyle, and having a very sharp wit, to being unable to care for myself, unable to read, to sit up, even to watch a TV show.  I have been on IV Rocephin now for 4 1/2 months.  I take 2 g, every 12 hours, four days in a row each week.  In addition, I take IV clindamycin, 900 mg , Six days in a row each month.  I also take ursodiol to prevent gallbladder failure from rocephin.  I have gone from completely bedridden, and suffering unendurable agony, to being semi-functional, able to care for myself, and  almost able to Work.",Eric with Lyme
2,Rocephin,Lyme Disease Neurologic,1.0,,"April 8, 2016",2,"After 4 weeks PICC line daily I needed Gallbladder removal. I was supposed to do 8 weeks treatment. I ended up stopping at 4. Never completed treatment. I never felt better I felt terrible everyday I was sick vomiting, headache, body aches, weak. But most of that is normal other than vomiting and gallbladder. It was also a little inconvenient. But no Lyme is great. I never feel good at all I'm in a wheelchair now I'm not well anymore I don't know that I'll be well until I get remission and lot of physical therapy between now and then.",Dying4aCure
