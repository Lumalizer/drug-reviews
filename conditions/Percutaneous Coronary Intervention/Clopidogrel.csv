0,Clopidogrel,Percutaneous Coronary Intervention,4,Taken for less than 1 month,"June 27, 2019",12,I have been taking the generic for Plavix.  I was taking the pill APO CL75 manufactured by Apotex with our any problem.  My druggist on my last prescription filled my generic for Plavix with the pill R 196 manufactured by Dr. Reddy's Laboratory.  After the switch I have experienced ankle swelling.  I do not know but highly suspect that this last pill is causing the swelling and wonder if this pill is the same.  Interesting!,SH
