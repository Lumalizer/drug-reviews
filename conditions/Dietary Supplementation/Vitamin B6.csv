0,Vitamin B6,Dietary Supplementation,10,Taken for less than 1 month,"August 5, 2020",4,"I’m taking 100 mg of vitamin B-6 pyridoxine for Edema of ankles, two or three times a week once daily with a light snack and plenty of water. Gradually, over three weeks, I am seeing a reduction in swollen ankles. Take it early n the day because it produced lucid dreams and lots of running to the toilet if taken at night. I’ve had swollen ankles since recovering from Covid 19. Increasing exercise, lowering sodium in foods also helps. Elevate your feet a few times each day.",Jeannie
