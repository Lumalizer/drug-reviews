0,Acetylcysteine,Dietary Supplementation,9,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"April 17, 2021",5,"NAC is scientifically proven to raise glutathione levels and that's why I take it, for liver support. I take a low dose as recommend by my doctor he say most people take way too much. I does have some side effects one is an acidic stomach the other is that it makes me tired. I've switched my dose to night time with food. He said it will take months for it to work so stick with it so I am. Good science behind this supplement!",Stubie
1,Acetylcysteine,Dietary Supplementation,10,Taken for less than 1 month,"July 1, 2020",6,I was struggling to breathe with COPD and using inhalers continually.  Doctor prescribed these tablets - 1 to be taken 4 times daily.  Almost immediate relief.  I cannot believe how much they improved my breathing by clearing mucus from my lungs.  Fantastic!!,Mary
