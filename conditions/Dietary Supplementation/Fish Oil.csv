0,Fish Oil,Dietary Supplementation,,Taken for less than 1 month,"March 20, 2022",0,"I have severe neuropathy and my Dr prescribed gabapentin. In 3 months I gained 30 lbs and it really didn't do anything for my pain. So, when I went to my cardiologist and told him about my weight gain. He told me it was the gabapentin. He instructed me to wean off of them. Then as I was talking about the pain and he told I had blockages he told me I could try fish oil but I would have to take a lot. He had look on his face which didn't seem too convinced or so I thought. I asked him about how much. He told me 10000 a day. I figured I try it. Since my pain was severe I'd try anything. I wish I hadn't. Took it for two weeks and every time I sweat from anywhere there is a foul fish odor. It's been about a year. It's finally starting to decrease but only by about half. My next hope is activated charcoal to see if it can help. I hadn't been willing to try it because of my medications. So now spring is here and I can get off of some of my pain medications. The cold weather makes it worse.",Betty

2,Fish Oil,Dietary Supplementation,4.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"April 3, 2018",15,"I have to take flax seed oil instead of fish oils. I know it sounds weird, and I've never heard of it, but fish oil capsules cause bright blue splotches on my skin! I don't mean the dark bluish bruise color, but bright. No, I'm not allergic to shell fish, don't have a bleeding problem or on blood thinners, my cholesterol numbers are great, I don't bruise easily, was on no medications at the time I tried it, my sugar level runs about 79-80 normally, and I have a good diet free of processed or refined foods-no pop, rarely any fried food, sugars except naturally occurring.",Shiloh
3,Fish Oil,Dietary Supplementation,2.0,,"May 18, 2014",50,"It was suggested that I supplement my diet with fish oil, don't remember if it was for my high blood pressure or arthritis, but she was a nurse and I said yes. Three weeks later, my stomach will not settle, everything I eat makes me feel ""too full"", gassy, and nauseous, and there is nothing but (please pardon me) liquid for stools. As of today I am discontinuing use to see if that is my problem. I hope this helps someone suffering in the same manner I am.",KANG- Ra
