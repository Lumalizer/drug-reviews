0,Omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids,Dietary Supplementation,,Taken for less than 1 month,"March 20, 2022",0,"Fish Oil (omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids):I have severe neuropathy and my Dr prescribed gabapentin. In 3 months I gained 30 lbs and it really didn't do anything for my pain. So, when I went to my cardiologist and told him about my weight gain. He told me it was the gabapentin. He instructed me to wean off of them. Then as I was talking about the pain and he told I had blockages he told me I could try fish oil but I would have to take a lot. He had look on his face which didn't seem too convinced or so I thought. I asked him about how much. He told me 10000 a day. I figured I try it. Since my pain was severe I'd try anything. I wish I hadn't. Took it for two weeks and every time I sweat from anywhere there is a foul fish odor. It's been about a year. It's finally starting to decrease but only by about half. My next hope is activated charcoal to see if it can help. I hadn't been willing to try it because of my medications. So now spring is here and I can get off of some of my pain medications. The cold weather makes it worse.",Betty

2,Omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids,Dietary Supplementation,5.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"July 15, 2021",0,"For the reviewer who had this experience:  thought I had pancreatitis. Stomach acid high, no ulcer. Now, I have a liver cyst. Read side effects before taking.I had the exact same experience with pancreatitis before taking the fish oil. The liver cyst and high alkaline acids were a metastasis of breast cancer that spread to the liver. I'm not suggesting you have cancer, but the the other symptoms were present before the oil. Perhaps your liver test was a matter of bad timing, because they should have tested it as soon as you had a pancreatitis attack  and performed an MRI/ultrasound.",Anonymous
3,Omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids,Dietary Supplementation,,,"January 17, 2020",2,"I have Gout for more than 10 years and been advised that omega 3 fish oil is good/ no harm for people like me. Be careful, I looked at my omega 3 bottle today which made of anchovy, mackerel, sardine - fish. These are the worst for gout patients. That is why my gout kept coming back for the last 10 years despite any strictly diets and treatments. People with Gout, please stay away from omega 3 fish oil by my experience.",Tommy

5,Omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids,Dietary Supplementation,,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"February 21, 2019",6,TheraTears Nutrition (omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids):Recommended by eye doctor.  Took 3 pills a day for one and a half months.  My pulse rate soared and stayed about 114-132 for the entire time I took the vitamin.  Stopped taking the supplement and right back to normal. Seeing a cardiologist to make sure but feel I'm possibly allergic to something in this supplement. Check before taking or if you take stop if you start feeling strange.  It's an awful feeling to have your pulse racing.  Hope this helps someone. Hard to imagine vitamins could cause this.,JPH
6,Omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids,Dietary Supplementation,4.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"April 3, 2018",15,"Fish Oil (omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids):I have to take flax seed oil instead of fish oils. I know it sounds weird, and I've never heard of it, but fish oil capsules cause bright blue splotches on my skin! I don't mean the dark bluish bruise color, but bright. No, I'm not allergic to shell fish, don't have a bleeding problem or on blood thinners, my cholesterol numbers are great, I don't bruise easily, was on no medications at the time I tried it, my sugar level runs about 79-80 normally, and I have a good diet free of processed or refined foods-no pop, rarely any fried food, sugars except naturally occurring.",Shiloh
7,Omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids,Dietary Supplementation,9.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"July 23, 2016",11,"Started taking this at the suggestion of a doctor. Not really for anything in particular but just for general health. Around this same time I was very overweight (over 300 lbs) and had very high blood pressure, systolic 150-160, diastolic 100-110 (I had to be put on blood pressure medication). After a year of being on Omega-3 I had lost 75 lbs (I wasn't even really trying, didn't exercise or anything) and my blood pressure was greatly improved, systolic 102-125, diastolic 70-85. I would totally recommend Omega-3 to anyone not only for hearth health but just general well being. Not everyone will experience such a dramatic improvement I would think but Omega-3 is great for the heart and the brain.",Jwright7784

Three weeks later, my stomach will not settle, everything I eat makes me feel ""too full"", gassy, and nauseous, and there is nothing but (please pardon me) liquid for stools.
