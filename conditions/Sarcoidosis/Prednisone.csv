0,Prednisone,Sarcoidosis,,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"August 20, 2021",0,"I went to the hospital in December 2020 with pains in my lungs. The Dr said it was muscles then did a chest xray. Then told me it was pneumonia.  In January had a lung biopsy found out it was sarcoidsis.  Was in the hospital  for 4 days with a tube through my ribs into my lung because my lung collapsed. I have been on prednisone 6 months the sarcoids got a little better. But I have scarring.  I was off the prednisone for 2 weeks my lungs started to hurt again. So the dr put me back on. So I have been on prednisone for 7 out of the 8 months. They have me on a bone pill, magnesium, calcium and vitamin D. Because of cramping in my hands feet and legs. I bruise really easy. People stare at my arms when then talk to me. My immune system is weak so I get infections. I feel like rubbish every day.",Bc1976
1,Prednisone,Sarcoidosis,7.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"March 5, 2016",15,"Taking prednisone for 6 weeks starting 60mg daily. After first week it significantly reduced chest pain. In week 5, dosage was already at 40mg, started feeling anxiety, tremors, increased blood pressure and heart beat 114-125, blurry vision, diahrrea, low potassium, decreased thyroid function, increased glucoze, and muscle weakness in legs. Dr reduced dosage to 20mg and prescribed potassium supplement. K came back to normal within a week. Now still on 20mg prednisone. So far my inflammation in mediastinal lymph nodes did NOT shrink and still having chest pain. Working on the right dosage and length of treatment.",GiMysz

Med after 7p keeps me awake at least 4 hr although I feel tired. Only been on for 1 month for new sarcoidosis   Breathing much better!  Chest tightness better! Energy level better !",ralphetta01
3,Prednisone,Sarcoidosis,9.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"December 16, 2012",26,I was graduated from initial 40mg to 2.5mg. This was found to be ineffective as I was always in and out of hospital with cough and other symptoms of sarcoidosis. I was later put on 20mg and all symptoms disappeared. My doctor is considering reducing it to 10mg.,thankful soul
4,Prednisone,Sarcoidosis,5.0,,"May 29, 2009",51,"This is the only drug doctors recommend for sarcoidosis. The side-effects of other heavy-duty immune suppressant drugs are considered worse than the sarcoidosis symptoms. It's a dual edged sword. It does reduce inflammation and makes breathing easier but it also has permanent effects. For me it permanently reduced thyroid function, increased puffiness in face, overall weight gain, insomnia and overall muscle stiffness to the point of spasms. ",horsecrab
