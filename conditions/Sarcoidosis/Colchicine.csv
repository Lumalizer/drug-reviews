0,Colchicine,Sarcoidosis,10,,"April 4, 2019",6,"I'm 39 years old and was in a car accident when I was 16 resulting in 16 surgeries. I didn't have anything specific happen to my heart but I had a lot of damage to that area (broken ribs, bleeding liver and kidneys, and collapsed lungs.) Within a few months I started having severe pain in my heart and after several trips to the ER I was diagnosed with pericarditis. It's inflammation of the sack that holds the heart and feels like a heart attack 24-7. My treatment over the years has been 800 mg ibuprofen every 4 hours and colchicine. Within 12 hours my flareup begins to get a little better and by day three of taking the medication I'm almost back to normal. I haven't had any upset stomach issues or weird side effects. My toes are a little tingly but I can handle that... can't handle the feeling of having knives going into my neck and chest with an elephant sitting on my chest. I only take this medication when I have a flare up every 6-12 months.",NK
