0,Junel,Menstrual Disorders,5.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"January 17, 2021",0,"I was on Junel FE 1/20 for a month and it was so awful. I had the worst headaches, I was super emotional, and my period was the worst it had been in years. I was switched to Larin FE 1/20 and the water weight had dropped down, in fact, I seem to be losing weight quite significantly but the acne did come back. I can’t necessarily attribute the acne to the BC cuz it was there before—so it’s most likely stress related. Junel helped with acne but sucked in every other department. Larin does seem to have any weird side effects other than the occasional headache so we’ll see how it fixes my horrible period cramps once the pack is done... Junel gets a 1, Larin gets a 5 until further notice",Anonymous

2,Junel,Menstrual Disorders,9.0,,"November 6, 2020",0,I was struggling with excruciating period pains for about a year. When I finally went to my OBGYN he prescribed me this birth control. I  tried a lot of different oral contraceptives and most of the time I had pretty bad experiences but this one worked the best for me. I didn't have any side effects except from lite headaches and breast tenderness. My periods got SO much lighter and almost pain-free.,Typog
3,Junel,Menstrual Disorders,1.0,,"April 26, 2019",7,"I'm finishing up my second month of these pills now, and I'm miserable. I have no energy, I had chest pain up until about a week ago, I'm depressed and extremely anxious, and I'm constantly between diarrhea and constipation. I'm nauseous daily, usually right before I take my pill and for the next few HOURS afterward. My face, my chest, and the back of my shoulders have been broken out. The breakouts on my chest and shoulders are something I've never experienced prior to taking this. The same goes for the spotting I experience about half way through the pack, and for the severe period symptoms I've been experiencing.I was trying to wait this medication out, since experts say it takes 3 months for your body to fully adjust to new hormones, but I'm going to quit this once I finish this month. I got on this to get my period regulated but the side effects are NOT worth it. I wouldn't recommend these pills to anyone.",kingsaerein
4,Junel,Menstrual Disorders,9.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"September 18, 2018",2,"I was hesitant to take birth control. I tried it twice between the ages of 17 and 20 and both times didn't like it. It made my acne worse and periods still were heavy. I guess my new doctor at age 26 actually listened to my problems and prescribed me with this. She said I was experiencing bad PMS. Nearly half my cycle my breasts hurt, I always seemed to struggle with acne no mater what product I used. I was over weight. My hair was brittle, heavy periods with painful cramps. This pill (Blisovi FE 1/20) fixed all of that!! My breasts are no longer tender, and I lost some weight. Been on it just over a year. Only reason I didn't give 10 stars is because I skip the placebo and still have some breakthrough bleeding and like two pimples each month.",LL

But it has been working great for me so far. I have been taking it for almost 3 months and I have had no side effects except a mild headache on and off and a little spotting. I’m sure that stuff will start to work itself out once my body gets used to it. and none of that is anything compared to what I was dealing with before hand. I would definitely recommend trying it out.,Anonymous
8,Junel,Menstrual Disorders,,,"November 8, 2017",5,"I was prescribed this for migraine prevention as I do not have a risk for pregnancy (I’m gay). For 8 months I took it at continuous doses, skipping the placebo period, as prescribed by the doctor. It didn’t seem to help my migraines but I kept thinking I needed to give it more time — I did enjoy the lack of cramps and periods. However, a few months ago I was diagnosed with stage 2 grade 3 IDC (breast cancer). I’m only 32 and genetic testing has revealed no mutations, which leaves this drug as the main culprit. Please, have a breast exam before starting this, do them on yourself, and pay attention to ANY breast changes. Mine presented as an indentation not a lump.

When it didn't (it actually got worse), my Doctor switched me to Loestrin 24 and my period was really light and I had almost no cramps at all. The only complaint I have is on YAZ I gained 7-10 lbs and I was hoping after switching to another birth control I would lose those extra pounds but so far it hasn't happened.",aly2010

The first birth control I used was YAZ. YAZ got me moody, I was gaining weight in the first month and was on my period everyday. The ads on TV scared my dad and told me I had to change. That's when the doctor prescribed Loestrin. I LOVE LOESTRIN! I lost weight on the pill, not moody, and I HAVE SLIM TO NONE PERIOD. I'm on the brown pill now and I'm not on my period (just a little spotting). Everybody is different so you got to find what's best for you and Loestrin was GREAT for me.!",T.B
133,Junel,Menstrual Disorders,7.0,,"April 12, 2010",5,"Loestrin 24 Fe (ethinyl estradiol / norethindrone):I'm on my 2nd month of taking Loestrin 24. I went to my doctor 2 months ago because I had not had a period during the 5 months prior to the visit. She prescribed to me from what I can recall oxyprogesterone, she told me it should start my period within 2-3 days. It didn't come until 2 weeks later so then I finally started taking Loestrin 24. That WHOLE first month I bled, some days it was just average bleeding, some light, and just a handful of days bad cramping and heavy. Now being on my 2nd month of this pill I'm on the 3rd week row of the pill pack and I'm already starting my period early. The only side effects I've noticed from taking this pill is my breasts have grown half a cup size, no nausea or weight gain so far.",ChelsieBelle
134,Junel,Menstrual Disorders,,,"April 8, 2010",15,"Loestrin 24 Fe (ethinyl estradiol / norethindrone):I'm 22 and have only been on Loestrin 24 for 5 months.  I started taking it because I was having severely irregular periods, and the first two months this pill did not help change that.  My doctor told me to wait it out through month 3, which I did, and I'm so glad about it.  I absolutely LOVE this pill.   I'm more emotional, but like most things in life, I do have some control over how my reactions are, so I can't blame everything on the pill. I have cyclical depression, but this pill has no real effect on it or my anxiety, so I'm lucky.  No acne, no weight gain but I did get a little (though not needed haha!) boost in cup size. Over all, I recommend this pill to all my friends and everyone who's looking for good birth control.",MamaBlew

In the beginning, I did experience some nausea for about the first month but once I got over that hurdle everything has gone well.  NO bloating, NO nausea, NO mood swings, and MOST IMPORTANTLY A VERY SHORT CYCLE! My cycle has always been irregular; having about one a year. So with me getting older my doctor said it would be best for my health to try and regulate my cycle.  Well it worked!  If I must have a cycle each month (after not having to for the past 20 yrs) its nice to have one only for a few days and without any PMS symptoms!",Ms_Kai

I was given this pill because I have a small fibroid. My doctor just said let's try this and see if this works. Even though the fibroid is small it is very painful at times. I have been on this pill for about two months and boy does it have me going crazy. I haven't gained weight or had any acne problems but I have had so many extra cycles and I'm not talking about spotting. It's like when I take this pill I start my cycle all over again everyday. I have also been VERY depressed and moody which is usually not me at all. And last but certainly not least my blood pressure has been through the roof! I have decided today I am going to stop.,Nymian

While obviously the general intent of the pill has been great, sex with the boyfriend and no pregnancy scares, otherwise I am not a fan of this pill. Every month since beginning, I have had two periods a month. Also, I am twenty four and had finally gotten out of the bad acne scene of my life, and this pill has brought it back. I have gained weight, but I know that is due to the fact that my boyfriend is deployed and I have found comfort in donuts. I am depressed, but again, I don't know if that's the pill, or the boyfriend gone issue.",Anonymous

I was on it for severe cramping and while it slightly dulled the cramps, its side effects made things worse than they were to begin with.  For the 4 months that I was on it, I had 2 periods a month, one half way through the pack and one at the end.  Both had bad cramps.  After the first month, my skin started to break out like crazy. Not only that, but this pill made me really moody, to the point that I would cry over nothing and get really upset at people. ",Anonymous
