Not only is it an effective birth control but it has helped keep my endometriosis at bay. Another plus is I haven’t had a real period since starting it, I’ve had a few days of light spotting here and there but nothing major. Fabulous birth control!",JOs
1,Yaz 28,Menstrual Disorders,5.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"May 16, 2020",0,I have been on this pill for a few days now. I switched from Lo Loestrin Fe because it was making me break out. I went on accutane awhile go. So getting acne again was the worst thing ever for me because I thought my fight was over. I got off for a month then started this new drug. Everything is going good expect that I am very nauseous. I even woke up last night throwing up. I hope this goes away very fast because  don’t know if I can keep doing this.,syd
2,Yaz 28,Menstrual Disorders,9.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"November 29, 2019",1,"I started taking generic Yaz for anxiety (including social anxiety), acne, heavy bleeding, and depression. I'm in the middle of month three and here are the results- slight positive effect on acne, reduces bleeding but I'm still getting a seven day period (still better than it was!), and has helped A LOT with anxiety/depression. After taking Yaz for a few days my anxiety completely disappeared. I think my anxiety was caused by hormonal imbalance, and Yaz corrects this. There was a one week period where I didn't have Yaz and I slipped into a depression. Started back on the next pack and the depression disappeared.        Lower libido and pretty bad heartburn are the only side effects I have noticed. But I can live with this since my mental/emotional state is so much improved and so stable.        Overall, I would definitely recommend this birth control pill for treating anxiety.",Leyla
3,Yaz 28,Menstrual Disorders,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"July 2, 2018",3,"My periods have gotten longer over the last year. My doctor suggested mirena or the pill. I figured it would help balance my hormones and shorten my 7-8 day periods.I started taking Gianvi and not long after taking it, I felt severely depressed. I had nausea, vomiting, fatigue, was lightheaded, stomach pains, and heavy bleeding w/ blood clots. I bled through clothes and constantly had to use the bathroom. After 10 days of bleeding along the other miserable symptoms, I called my Gyn. She told me to go to the ER if I felt lightheaded. I decided to go and discovered I had small fibroids. Even though the ER doc told me to finish the pack, I decided not to (I was 15 days in). I did some research on Yaz and found a lot of women suffering with the same symptoms. It’s crazy that taking a pill for only 15 day can wreak such havoc on your body. I’m going on day 17 of bleeding and it’s finally getting lighter. Worst experience ever!",Sunny

Gianvi has been amazing for me! The first month, my period was light and my cramps were way less. I typically had 2 days of very heavy cramping and heavy bleeding for 3-5 days. After the first month, the periods kept getting lighter and lighter. I’m at month 6 now and haven’t had a period in 2 months! The first month I broke out a bit, but now my skin is completely clear! I love this pill and hope they never stop making it. If you’re just starting Gianvi, I suggest giving it a few months before throwing in the towel. I’m so glad I did.",MamaB

The doctor told me I can skip placebo weeks for up to 3 months. So I did that and started spotting so I took it down to 2 months. Things were ok for a year but coming into 2018 I started spotting in between periods. Like non stop pink discharge. And I don’t know if I’ve always had them but I noticed tiny spider veins in my leg. I’m tan so you can barely see them but I notice them. I went to the doctor and told him my issues and he said to keep doing what I’m doing. So I said hell no, transferred all my records to an OBGYN office and hopefully getting an IUD on Monday. But I’ve heard horrible side effects on this pill. It has both estrogen and progesterone which can really cause issues but here’s what I experienced: weight loss, clearer skin, much higher sex drive. Literally the only issue is my spotting and the one spider vein. I’m so sorry for everyone who has apparently been through hell on this. I had great side effects",Berry

I have been on a few different BC pills for 20 years, but I don't quite remember this feeling. Looking down at something I'm reading or doing downward dog pose repeatedly or for longer durations makes me feel dizzy and nauseous.

No cramping or spotting or any weight gain. My bra size went from a 32B to a 32D, can't complain about that. I have endometriosis, and my periods without this pill were a painful nightmare. I was fainting due to the severity of my cramps, I was also vomiting due to the pain. I became anemic due to it too, but since going on this pill it is a breeze. I usually skip the inactive pills and just not have a period, but when I do it is about 3-4 days long with moderate cramping. Not as bad as before. I have no complaints or problems.",MayBrynn

Now I have basically no period pain at all and have to take zero pain relief medication...such a difference! My period was always pretty light but now it’s almost nothing! First month I had lots of break through bleeding but now nothing. In terms of my skin, I can definitely see a big improvement. It’s working much slower for his however (I’ve been on it 3 months).

I knew it would take around 3 months for my body to get used to this pill and I ended up taking it for 4. I really wanted this pill to work for me. However, the first 2-3 months were an extreme emotional roller coaster. My appetite increased dramatically and I gained a few pounds.
