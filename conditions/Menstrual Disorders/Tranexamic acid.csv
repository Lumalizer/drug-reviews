0,Tranexamic acid,Menstrual Disorders,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"March 5, 2022",1,"Lysteda (tranexamic acid):After my first two doses of Lysteda I got very sick to my stomach, horrible abdominal pain and vomiting and a very bad headache. I also feel very stiff in my joints and I'm a very active person so that is not common for me because I stretch regularly. Neck pain, elbow, and knee pain. I'm also very light headed and dizzy. I only took 4 total doses and I have been so sick for two days, and my bleeding did not reduce nor did the cramps like my doctor said they would. I ended up dealing with my typical horrible period pains/frustrations, as well as new side effects and pain from being so sick. I missed two days of work. I know this drug works well for a lot of people but absolutely not for me.",Anonymous
1,Tranexamic acid,Menstrual Disorders,5.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"February 27, 2022",0,"Since Oct 2021 I've had heavy menstrual bleeding due to uterine fibroids after having an internal ultrasound to confirm this. My periods have always been regular and at a normal flow which lasts about 4-5 days so I'm finding it quite hard to suddenly have to deal with this. I'm 44 and have been referred to a gynaecologist which could take up to 16 weeks for an appointment (I'm in the UK) These pills worked really fast the first time I took it, and I initially only took 1 pill 3 times a day and by day 3 the bleeding had stopped. However I've had to increase to 2 pills, 3 times a day and would take well over a week for the bleeding to stop. I've become anaemic, tired and rely on ferrous fumarate to up my iron levels which can be hard on the stomach at times. A few days later there would be spotting and the bleeding gets heavier again. I feel like I'm on a never-ending period and have to make sure I have enough pads and tampons at work. It's really getting me down.",Millasan
2,Tranexamic acid,Menstrual Disorders,1.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"December 21, 2021",2,"I'm 50 years old. Was put on for heavy periods, which I've had most of my life. I've had a recent ultrasound and exam. Healthy uterus, just a heavy cycle. The first month it did nothing to change my flow.  However I developed severe anxiety that had me in tears. I felt better after I stopped the medication. Read that anxiety was a rare side effect. Dr office said try it another month. Really wish I hadn't. Anxiety wasn't bad, but I am now on day 10 of my period. The last four days have been been lighter, but still using ultra tampons.   I've gone through an entire 45 count box (normally use about 30).  I've also gone through a package of pads. I'm exhausted and I've had to start a higher dose of iron because I've lost so much blood. I regret ever trying this and have decided to go the natural route with herbs and supplements.  Can't be worse than this!  I want my old period back!!",Krystal

I had a sizeable endometrial polyp removed, which didn't change super heavy periods (easily used 18 Ultra Tampons in 24 hours). So I was prescribed this. WOW. Life saver. Two cycles on it so far. Pros: -Period same time every month-On heavy days, I am left alone for 4-6 hrs at a time-I can sleep through the night without an accident-I don't have to be afraid to go out anymoreCons: -Unless this GoodRX coupon works $78/month (almost $960 a year) for a 5 day supply. W/o ins. it's $144/mo-Didn't help cramps (but I don't know if it's supposed to)-Both cycles on Day 4, a huge amount randomly comes out in one burst at some point in the day, then abruptly tapers off and ends for the month. Dunno why, but guessing thick lining has to do with it (I mean it can't just stay there every month). But one big outburst is WAY better than what I was living with.

Tranex has has done one key thing-I am no longer on house arrest for my entire period.I now take  a progestin only mini pill and Tranex. The efficacy of tranex seems to be related to quickly getting it into my system and taking it for the full 5 days. After  3 days I feel like I can venture away from the house.  I am often crampy, achy, and my stomach hurts. I feel full of pressure and need to pee. I have headaches and my energy level sucks. Since I felt like rubbish before tranex, I can’t assume my problems are related. There are two things that I think are related to the meds - my heart seems to beat faster after taking the pills  and I have weird joint twinges.What concerns me most is the frequency I take it.  My period often returns a few days after stopping tranex-when this occurs, I start another 5 day cycle. This overuse scares me but I feel the positives currently out weigh the negatives.",Freedom

The bleeding and clotting sending me to the bathroom every 30-45 mins has stopped, no more getting up in the middle of the night or changing the sheets at 4am and I've been very lucky with no side effects. 6 pills a day is a lot but considering the alternative of unstoppable bleeding, I happily take them.  It's not a total miracle, I still have ""heavy"" days those would've been a good day for me in the past.  It's worth it, I'm very happy with it.",Anonymous

I really don't want surgery so my GYN but me on Lysteda. I loved it for the first couple of months-- After the 2nd month, my cycle started occurring every 2-3 weeks. One month it did not happen at all. Then the last 2 cycles seemed to be normal - until the end, then they started all over again with clots and heavy bleeding. Back to my gyn.  Looks like I may have to have the surgery afterall.",g-ma in cali

But the fourth month I started having horrible lower back pain, the cramps came back but the flow was still light.  However, the last two months, my cycle came within 2 weeks and I have my cycle again.  According to the dosage and usage, I am unsure if taking it more than 5 days is recommended.  I had my cycle for 5 days, it stopped for 1 day and started back up.  Tried contacting my GYN but couldn't.",Anonymous

I feel better and did not feel it caused headaches and I do get PMS migraines as before.  I would recommend it.  I had a DNC to help with my problem 3 months ago and last month I started clotting and heavy bleeding again.  My doctor told me to try this, as birth control did not do anything positive and made me feel like I am pregnant and gain weight. I am grateful this works as on the heavy bleeding clotting days I would feel emotionally slipping into real depression. I am not depressed but the bleeding seems to bring erratic mood swings. This did help as the doctor said it should. I am not worried about blood clots as I do not smoke.",Anonymous

The bleeding was lighter but still lasted 7 plus days.  One major concern I had was in regard to passing clots.  While normally heavy, I passed two extremely huge (much much larger than normal) clots.  Hoping a result of just first time using.",Anonymous
101,Tranexamic acid,Menstrual Disorders,10.0,,"January 7, 2010",42,This is a terrific medication for me. I take it for excessively heavy monthly periods. Normally they are so heavy I can't leave the house for a day or two. This really has helped me to deal with the problem without taking hormones or having to have a hysterectomy. I have had no side effects whatsoever and find it very tolerable.,Anonymous
