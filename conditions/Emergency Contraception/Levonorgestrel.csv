0,Levonorgestrel,Emergency Contraception,10.0,,"April 1, 2022",0,"First of all pill really does his job!!! We had accident our condom broke and he finished in me. So I took pill after 1-2 hours. I was scared and cried all morning, I was concerned because I’m underweight and pill could have not worked. After 2 days my boobs started to hurt and they were swollen. After 1 week I started spotting, and for the first day of spotting my stomach was hurting like during my period, I spotted till my actual period started, it was crazy, I bleed ( spotted) for about 18 days. My boyfriend was so helpful, he was so caring and was trying to get my attention from the accident. Some days were so hard emotionally and physically… yoga helped so much, I was practicing yoga for hormonal balance about 2 week’s and my period started one day before my actual date of period. So girl’s don’t worry, be safe and everything will be alright. I will be happy if my experience will help someone. This pill has side affect’s but don’t be scared.",Foff
1,Levonorgestrel,Emergency Contraception,,,"April 1, 2022",3,"Plan B (levonorgestrel):I promised I would come back and right a review after I knew it worked since everyone else’s reviews helped me not lose my mind. I had completely unprotected sex after a few too many drinks on March 20th. Little did I know that it was the day I was ovulating. I went and got the plan b about 12 hours after the deed. I was terrified because I read that it doesn’t work if you are already ovulating but I figured it wouldn’t hurt to try. I also read that it doesn’t work if you are over 155lbs and I am almost 200lbs. The first day I just had a little bit of an upset stomach but nothing major, 5 days later I started having cramping and nausea and sore breasts. I thought for sure I was pregnant because I had all of the same symptoms with my pregnancy with my son. Needless to say I was freaking out!! Well fast forward to the 31st of March I started spotting which I thought for sure was implantation bleeding but today is the 1st of April and I have my actual period. It works ladies!",MLL
2,Levonorgestrel,Emergency Contraception,9.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"March 31, 2022",2,"Plan B (levonorgestrel):Plan B served it's purpose and worked for me when I had sex with no protection during my fertile window. However, the lack of information regarding the side effects it's really concerning. In many credible websites it is stated that the side effects last at maximum one week. Well, that certainly wasn't the case for me, and as I can assume by reading the reviews here, not the case for many people. After the first few days of taking the pill I experienced no side effects. Only after 4/5 days of taking it i started experienced spotting, similar to my similar period, but that only lasted for about 3 days. After that I experienced severe headaches, nausea, really drastic mood swings for the rest of the month. It's an incredible high dosage of hormones and it can mess up with you body and make you go through a pretty tough time for way longer than one week. I got my period exactly one week late of when I expected, so I can't really complain in that regard because it does work.",Anonymous
3,Levonorgestrel,Emergency Contraception,10.0,,"March 28, 2022",1,"Plan B (levonorgestrel):For anyone worrying and stressing, you’ll be fine. This is my second time taking Plan B and the first time is always rough. Put trust in the pill. The first time I was anxious, stressed, and googling every pregnancy symptom because I’m 18 and can’t have a kid yet. I took the pill Jan 26 and got my period a day later than usual (Feb 16). I had to take it again on March 23rd because semen had gotten on me but not in me so my boyfriend and I rushed to the nearest CVS and I took the pill and I got my period five days later (March 28)!!! I'm two weeks early for my usual period date but I’m sure that’s the effects of the pill! distract yourself and trust that it worked (definitely works better the sooner you take it).",Anonymous

5,Levonorgestrel,Emergency Contraception,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"March 27, 2022",0,Take Action (levonorgestrel):So I taken this tablet about a month ago. I'm a 42 year old woman and been married for twelve years. Really with the way the world is going right now I do not want to have kids and we had a scare. I went to Rite Aid and purchased this for around $30 almost immediately after the mess up happen. It has been over a month. I am extremely still bloated and look 6 months pregnant. I have not got my monthly cycle I am extremely late and I've taken 6 pregnancy tests and they are all negative. I would not advise anybody to this pill. Since I've taken it I have been fatigued to the point where I can't get up out of bed. This one pill completely messes up your hormones. I feel like I'm going to die every day since I took it that one day.,Nicole
6,Levonorgestrel,Emergency Contraception,4.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"March 26, 2022",0,"Take Action (levonorgestrel):I had sex February 18 and February 20 I have taken two pills for both of my incidents and I have yet to have a period and usually start in the middle of the month   so I’m not sure what’s going on. I have all the pregnancy symptoms (breast tenderness and blue veins, very very bloated that won’t go away), I’ve had these symptoms for about 2 weeks I’d say. I also thought I started my period on March 15 but it turns out it only lasted one day. But I’m just keep thinking that I’ve taken a large dosage and it’s probably been messing my body up right now but will be taking a test soon. I am very one unlucky gal so it wouldn’t surprise me if It’s not good news to me. I’ve taken this pill before and it worked so hope for some good news.",cass
7,Levonorgestrel,Emergency Contraception,,,"March 26, 2022",0,"I promised myself I'll write a review if my auntie flo came thru. So babe and I had the deed on 9th February and according to my flo app it was my first day into the fertile window so I took the plan B 5 hours later.  On 18th of February I have this unusual feeling in my body,,,stomach was so bloaty, boobs were so tender and swollen, frequency in urination, temperature was high and nausea ...Googling this directed me to PREGNANCY ..I panicked!!!!! I did a Prego test and it turned out negative I was still not sure, were it not of this platform of reviews I don't know what I would have done.  The following week on Thursday I find a pink discharge so I was convinced I was Prego because to me it was implantation bleeding.  The pink spotting turns to pale red and goes for 3 days.  I had a Prego test that Thursday and it turns negative again.  On the third of the spotting that was on Sunday, I had the third Prego test and it turns out negative....Mind you the symptoms persisted ..",Aika

It’s $50 for a reason. My period is pretty brutal, but it is better than an unwanted pregnancy. Stay safe ladies and relax",relax!
9,Levonorgestrel,Emergency Contraception,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"March 24, 2022",2,"Plan B (levonorgestrel):So I told myself I wouldn't say jack until the stuff worked lol. I was scared, I saw reviews that should calm me but I was still scared. Probably because mine was quite different. March 4th and 5th I had unprotected sex with my Boyfriend at least 5 times. He did not cum inside me, but we never can tell. I used post pill on the 5th. That was when it hit me few hours later that I was ovulating, NO!! I started searching online and I saw where ""pills don't work during ovulation"". Everything went blank lmao. I'd say don't even try researching and buying lots of PT tests, but some of us can't help it even though the truth is right on our faces lol. So for the benefit of doubts. You can try. But I wouldn't advice it, it's waste of money. The pills work 100%. I saw some spotting 2 days after I used the pill. Some people here said 5 days mostly. Mine was Day 2. Everything was happening to me, nausea, bloating, hardened nipples and I was so miserable lol. Got my period March 21. So Relax Girl! Kisses",Senora

The official pages will talk about mild cramps for the first few days it’s been it’s been over a week for me I’m technically supposed to start my period in a couple of days but I’m less worried about it being late now because of all of you.

11,Levonorgestrel,Emergency Contraception,8.0,,"March 24, 2022",0,"Aftera (levonorgestrel):Okay, so I’m writing this review because I’ve used Aftera and Plan B before with varying levels of success and different scenarios each time. Typically, I take EC after my spouse and I make a mistake and he ejaculates inside during a fertile window. I’ve had 2 pregnancies, both times I’d taken EC within 24 hours but I was likely ovulating already and thus, it didn’t work because the deed was already done. On countless other times we would be 4-5 days pre ovulation and everything works out just fine.",Anonymous

14,Levonorgestrel,Emergency Contraception,,,"March 23, 2022",0,"Aftera (levonorgestrel):Hi ladies, I just wanna say I have no idea if this works but do not stress! My boyfriend and I did the deed while I was on low chance of pregnancy. We used protection and it broke after about 10 minutes, so there’s possibly pre-ejaculation inside of me. Once we realized, he went to CVS and had to get me Aftera because there was no Plan-B. I have very bad anxiety, so of course I’m overthinking it and searching up things 24/7 for answers. DO NOT LOOK ANYTHING UP! GOOGLE WILL GIVE YOU DIFFERENT ANSWERS ALL THE TIME! Just wait it out and put positive energy behind it.  I’ll update sooner than later hopefully, since I take my test on Sunday. I have yet to receive any side effects other than a bit of stomach pain, headache, and back pain + my period is 2-3 days late. I am worried of course but everything will be ok! I do weigh about 160-165 so let’s hope it works! :) I’ll update soon!",anon

She started bleeding dark brown for 2 days followed by thick discharges for 3 days, 10 days after taking the pill and since then nothing. The due date for her period came and nothing, waited more days because was expecting it late due to the pill, then 10 days late and still nothing.  We started to get paranoid. She was bloated, having insane appetite and few times was nauseated. 28 days late and still nothing, then after being 35 days late, her period finally arrived. Was having anxiety attacks for 2 whole months. The stressed was not worth it. I'm sure the pill works with few failed cases, but in our case, I think the chances of pregnancy was already minimal with the withdrawal method and the days of her cycle we had unprotected sex.

I was freaking out because this was my first time this happened. Around 3:30 pm I took the Plan B pill so within 12/13 hours. The next week I was feeling nauseated, EXTREMELY bloated, had weird discharge. 4 days after my expected ovulation date, I was spotting pink & light brown & I swore it was implantation bleeding. At that point I was fully convinced I was pregnant. I took a few pregnancy test ( 12 days ) after I had unprotected sex  & it came up negative but that wasn't enough for me considering my body literally felt like it was early pregnancy symptoms.

This pill has caused me to have ovarian cyst and the list goes on. Every one has different experiences. I ended up taking this pill in The beginning of October 2021 and didn’t end up having a cycle until February 2022 I took several pregnancy test and they were all negative. I found out I had an ovarian cyst after rushing myself to the hospital and finding out I also had a UTI urinary tract. Doctors also told me to get my colon check and still until this day I’ve been having bad abdominal pain. Never had this happen to me until I took this pill.

My period was late 6 days so I was definitely getting concerned and worried I was expecting. My period had finally came! I also used some manifesting or what not but in the end everything worked out to my favor. I wanna let y’all know everything is gonna be okay… seriously.

I was in your shoes once, and I'm telling you now you're going to be fine. I had unprotected sex a day before my ovulation day (according to flow app), and took the morning after the next day (almost hours later). Exactly 10 days later I started bleeding what looked like implantation bleeding. I was so scared and shocked. I watched video after video, did tons of research and all that just made me feel worse. The bleeding went on for about 5 days and was dark red. After that I wasted my money and took 3 home pregnancy tests, two pee tests and one blood test where I had to stab myself. All were negative. Two days ago, 8 days after my expected period date, my period started. I will NEVER have unprotected sex ever again!

If that's what you're thinking about just go pay it, it's worth the cost. Abortion is far more expensive and far worse of an experience. And having a baby of course is even more expensive. But more than anything your regret and anxiety is even worse! You will thank yourself later that you took it. I was skeptical if I got pregnant from that one time but all it takes is one time, so my logic finally kicked in and I ran to go get it. I had sex on Friday and didn't go until Monday morning to get Plan B and still got my period about 14 days later. It worked. I got it at my local Ralph's and you have to ask a store clerk to open their glass display case where it's locked up to give it to you. Just try to do nice meditations and breathing exercises and relax and trust that this pill does what it's supposed to. There are so many reviews here as proof.

Here is my story: I had unprotected sex on February 11 (he ejaculated in me twice). My period was on February 1 so I had sex in my absolute most fertile time and took Plan B during ovulation. Online tells you it won't work during ovulation. Take it anyway, it still works! I'm proof.

I took a plan B because the condom slipped off inside me, and he was sure that he didn’t ejaculate yet but I saw so many posts and articles saying that precum can still get you pregnant. So, I took plan B 40 minutes after the sex. I didn’t really get any side effects from taking it. A week after taking it, I started getting brown discharge which was very similar to implantation bleeding and I was freaking out so much. It was too early to take a pregnancy test, so I waited a week to take one. I’m so glad I waited because I finally got my period ! this pill really does work and it’s really helpful to stay off of google and doing all the research about it.",anonymous

So I got a take action pill instead. I took it around an hour after we had sex. My period was suppose to come on January the 12th but it didn’t. So I assumed the pill was going to cause me to be a few days late just like a Plan B would but nooo. This pill stressed me out!!!!! I was scared to take a pregnancy test because I didn’t want to know the answer but days kept on going by without my period but still I just waited it out. Then my period came on!…..BUT IT WAS 11 DAYS LATE! My periods are regular so I’ve never been so scared. It works but depending on your body you have to give it time. I also started my birth control the same day I took the take action pill. I also weigh over 230lbs and it worked for me. I hope this helps!,Nikki

This was my first time and I took it last Dec 10, had some bleeding 7 days later - not sure if it was period but I think its just bleeding from the pill since it was not as long as my regular period. I took a pregnancy test a week after that and came out negative. I was suppose to get my period on the 27th but it didn’t come. 4 weeks later, I still don’t have my period. Because of the stress, I’ve been taking weekly pregnancy tests which were all negative results. I didn't get the worse symptoms but I did notice my breast got swollen, my stomach was bloated, and slight cramps. Thankfully, yesterday (Jan 23, 11pm), I got my period! I waited until today to make sure if it's my period and not just bleeding. The flow is very different and event the color of blood. So yeah, I do recommend but if you are sexually active, highly recommended to have a birth control plan. For anyone reading this, hopefully, you'll be fine!",lns9491

So I had my last period on the 27th Sep which was 7 days late cos I had taken Levonelle that month. I had sex on the 9th (within my fertile window) and I was supposed to ovulate on the 13th Sep. He didn't finish in me, but when I went to the toilet I saw that eggwhite clear discharge and started panicking that I was ovulating  so took Levonelle again a few hours later. I didn't have any symptoms but sore boobs for like 7 days after around 10 days of taking the pill. My next period was due on the 27th Oct, it never came. I waited and waited... I did 6 urine tests and 1 blood test, everything was coming back negative. Finally, today, I've got bleeding. My period was 50 DAYS LATE. The pill messes up your body and your chemical balance.

Till this date I have taken the pill 3 times. The first time my period was delayed by 4 days. Next time, I had no delay. And the third time, which was very recent, scared the pants off  me. I have always had a 28 days cycle. And it strictly stays that way. This September I took the pill on 8th day of my cycle. After 10 days I spotted a little. I didn't get my period in October. In November first week, I again spotted for 5 days but still there was no sign of normal period. I decided to consult a gynae. I explained everything to her. And she told me that it is pretty normal. As the pill has a very high level of progesterone, it makes the body's natural hormonal levels derail and it takes a bit time and maybe sometimes longer for the levels to go back to normal.

I then had light cramping, lower back pains, light, thin watery discharge. 3 days before my expected period I did another LH check, as I read it could detect early preg.

Also, the brand name of emergency contraceptive does NOT matter as long as it contains levonorgestrel and always take it as early as you can! Two weeks later, I’ve never been more grateful for my period cramps. Stay sane ladies, and stay off the Internet!",notamama21

He also got an off brand that I never used before ( I've taken it 2 times prior). I waited way past my missed period because I had taken Plan B before and it caused me to have a period almost a month late. But I felt off and took a test and sure enough, I was pregnant. I feel if maybe I had taken it sooner, it may have been affective, but it wasn't or it may have been the off brand as well. I honestly don't fault the pill, I fault myself and waiting for so long before I took it. I've taken the pill before while ovulating and took it right away and it worked for me.

On the 5th day of my period, unfortunately the condom broke and I had the pill within an hour. I didn’t have any major side effects except for acne all over my body and terrible mood swings . One week later, I had brown spotting that lasted for about 3 days. For the next few weeks, I stressed myself so much and that I convinced myself that I am pregnant. Sore breasts, Abdominal cramps, back ache, frequent urination. This is because the pill can mimic pregnancy symptoms so DO NOT PANIC. I finally got my periods 4 days after my expected date. I WAS RELIEVED .Soon after taking the pill, most women experience a withdrawal bleed (brown spotting) after about 1 week. However it is not a mandate, many women do not experience withdrawal bleed and it is completely normal. That doesn’t mean you are pregnant. Don’t compare yourself with others.

Was extremely anxious and the thought of being pregnant was terrifying. 5 days later I had spotting which turned the next day into heavy blood and cramps I never experienced before and lasted for 5 days. I was sure it wasn't my period because I just got my period the week before. Took a pregnancy blood test 14 days after intercourse and came back negative but I wasn't feeling sure yet as it might have been a false negative and too early to check. Then on 11 July (my expected period date) it didn't come so I came back to read the reviews everyday until 10 days later I decided to take a blood test again and it came back negative. So I decided to wait for another 2 weeks to test again. Finally few days later on 24 I got my period today and I've never been happy to see my period like today!!!!

I bled for another two days and then stopped. I saw on this website that some spotting was normal. The next week or so I was very anxious. Then my expected period date came around and NOTHING. I told myself not to freak out until it was 1 week late. So a week late....and no period. I was so scared. I took a pregnancy test on May 23rd. My period was 10 days late, but the test came back negative. Flash forward one day later, I swear I’ve felt cramps all day and finally A PERIOD! Trust this!",Brookm

Everything happened really fast so I wasn't sure if any of it got inside me but it was really messy. I was freaking out because my expected ovulation date was the next day and I read that plan B doesn't work if you take it a day before ovulating. We got a plan B like an hour later and waited. My expected period date was June 1st, and I got my period yesterday, may 20th. I don't think I had ovulated because I usually can tell by checking if my discharge is white and gooey like egg whites. Bottom line is that the pill works. If you guys are going through the same thing I did, please stay offline.

He pulled out both times. And I did not plan B this one because I just didn’t think 2 back to back was smart. literally 12 days later I started getting brown discharge. So fast forward, a week of brown spotting and light bleeding and picnicking because I just swore it was implantation bleeding.

Since I took this the first day of my period, I can’t say if anything I felt was the pill OR my regular period symptoms. I did end up bleeding for 9 full days instead of my usual 4/5. I figured it was stress that made it longer. Looking back, I’m certain it was the pill making me bleed. Fast forward to today, 03/20 and my period is 3 days late. Usually my period arrives a day EARLY. I’ve had period symptoms all week. I took a pregnancy test and it came back negative. I’ll take a second one in a week, but have my fingers crossed that my period comes soon. I DO NOT recommend this brand to anyone. Pay the extra cash for Plan B if you can.

I knew it wasn't implementation bleeding, but I also knew that it was not my period. The days passed and I waited for my actual period. I was so freaked out, because I googled so much. While I waited for my period I felt like a zombie. On the 35 day of my cycle I took a pregnancy test which came out negative. Took the second one on the 38 day (period was already 9 days late at that time). It too was negative but I worried so much. In the end my period came 15 DAYS LATE!! Don't freak out ladies.

The day after my period ended my man finished all the way inside me. I took Plan B the next day and started spotting the next day. For 2 1/2 weeks after I spotted and bled off and on. I was so worried it was too much bleeding since I just had gotten off of my period. Google had me worried it was implantation bleeding. A few days before the 3 week mark I began to spot less and the pregnancy test I took was negative. I was so relieved!! A few days after I tested again to be sure and that test was negative.

Nausea, severe bloating, sensitive bleeding gums, cramps, mood swings, fatigue, even breast changes. Every woman’s body is different in how it will react to the huge dose of hormones. PMS, Plan B, and pregnancy symptoms can be very similar so just breathe and know you’re not alone. Also, if you’re scared/ nervous, don’t take a pregnancy test alone. It’s going to be ok.

Took the pill one hour after, and asked different pharmacists/nurses and doctors whether it would still work and they literally rolled their eyes saying ""Girl, of course it does"". My period arrived 4 days early with no particular complications (it hurt more than usual, but well). The pill not only can delay ovulation, it also stops a fertilized egg to attach to the uterus.

I’ve been reading these reviews and I tried to convince myself that even though my period was late, I wasn’t pregnant. I did have sex during day 9 of my cycle and suspected my boyfriend didn’t pull out on time. Took it within 24 hours. We had sex again on day 16 or my cycle without protection because I though I had ovulated already and that there was no danger. Just to be sure, I took another pill within 12 hours. On around day 25, my nipples got HUGE and sore. I discarded it as PMS and the pill’s side effects. Today I’m a week late, and making an appointment with planned parenthood. Now I’m reading abortion stories instead of planB’s. Didn’t work, every though I took it TWICE. Please be careful ladies! If your man finishes inside you, the IUD is a better option for emergency contraception. Lesson learned.",Sarah

Took this right after my partner and I got carried away and had him finish without a condom, and then realizing it was the day of my ovulation! I fell into a rabbit hole of looking up pregnancy symptoms and not believing in 3 negative tests that I delayed my period till day 45 (when I'm usually on a 30 day cycle), so I strongly advise against trying to convince yourself of a pregnancy that won't happen :) Your body has a very small window of getting pregnant each month, and even then it has to have everything ready in perfect timing to do so- which is still hard for people that are actually trying to conceive! So relax, and believe in that negative pregnancy test after 2 weeks. Definitely consider the use of contraceptives each time you have sex no matter what if you want to be stress free in the future.",Allie

I started heavily bleeding on January 18th for about 7 days, with blood clots, cramps, breast tenderness, headaches and dizziness, which is very normal for my period. This also would've been a second period for January, which was very annoying. I am currently waiting for my February period, which may be late, this is absolutely normal.

I experienced no major side affects that I can relate to Plan B specifically. I will say that restless sleep and night sweats did occur for a week or 2 after taking it but that could also be related to being back on the pill which I always kind of struggle with anyway. Also was very fatigued, nauseous & experienced more headaches than usual but that could all also be stress-induced.

Take the pregnancy test if you’re late take 5 if you want if they all come back the same trust it. My period was almost a month late, 3 weeks and 5 days. Stress and the hormonal imbalance from the pill WILL DELAY YOUR PERIOD. Do not freak out, stop googling everything. It’s okay if you spotted a week after taking a pill, it’s normal to spot more than once, it’s normal to feel cramps at random times. I felt cramps 4 days before having my period and I usually feel them a day before having my period. Take the pregnancy test. Find an online gynecologist and tell them if you feel symptoms of anything but it is most likely plan b if your pregnancy test comes back negative. It affects women differently but discharge is also normal, take it easy honey, find some birth control if you can’t afford the mistake. I can’t and I learned my lesson.

786,Levonorgestrel,Emergency Contraception,9.0,,"September 28, 2020",4,So I came on this forum a few days ago because I had unprotected sex and although I used this emergency contraception tablet could not help but worry that I could become pregnant!!!All I can say is that I was worrying for nothing and this does not help the matter.  I took the emergency pill on the 19th Sept approximately 12 hours after I had unprotected sex and my period was due 22nd. Panicking panicking but thanking God my period had come on the 25th!!! Now I will still take a pregnancy test and the end of the week to be sure but I'm certain I'm not.  Girls don't panic try not to stress and rest assured that this does work. What I will say is that I had bad cramps a few days ago but I usually do with my periods anyway so not concerned. Just wanted to share my experience and never having unprotected again unless I want a baby. X,Flower b

No symptoms from this except sore breasts but everybody’s body is different. My period was 3 days late & finally came this morning, I cried. I'm not sure if pill is what prevented the pregnancy or if i just got lucky, but I'm thankful I'm not pregnant.

I took Plan B about a week before my period was scheduled to come. *Note: I did not know Plan B is likely to be much less effective after ovulation - its primary function is to delay ovulation.* My first period came right on time, and I thought I was in the clear. Boy was I in for a ride. My cycle is usually around 25-26 days, and my cycle *after* my first period post-plan B was 44 days. So I took Plan B, had my first period on time, but my second period was almost 3 weeks late. During that time I experienced a whole array of symptoms: ice cold hands and feet, nausea, really horrible headaches, crazy moods and generally being very anxious. I’ve never experienced anything like it. Thankfully not pregnant - just know that Plan B throws your body totally out of whack and it may take a few cycles to return to normal.",Aj

Estimated Ovulation: Jan 14 Conception: Jan 15 (took pill within 30min-1hr that night) Period: Jan 29. Even after ovulation this pill CAN STILL WORK! I had no symptoms until a week after I took the pill. I started spotting brownish/reddish discharge (lasted for a week on & off). Freaked out bc I thought this was implantation bleeding. Continued spotting and started having sore breasts, back pain, fatigue. All side effects of the pill. A couple days leading up to my period I had diarrhea, gas, back pain, and leukorrhea. After 2 weeks of stress my period arrived, 1 day late. My advice: take the pill ASAP, don’t research your symptoms (Plan B side effects are extremely similar to early pregnancy symptoms), and stress can cause your period to be late so don’t worry if you’ve missed your period, it’s more than likely gonna be late if you take the pill after ovulation.",Aunt Flo

I found out recently that most women only ovulate for 8 hours so there is a small window for it to happen. Although sperm can live up to 72 hours. So if they’re hanging out when you begin to ovulate, you may become pregnant. Watch the new Netflix special about sex education, specifically the episodes about fertility and pregnancy. They were a huge eye opener for me. Also, I have the Clue App to keep track of my period. Clue has taught me more than school ever did about my period, ovulation, and the like.",Miranda

First off accidents happen but it’s best to learn from them and take something away from them. If you take the plan b one step within 72 hours it will work - and the earlier you take it the better! Trust the pill. It’s possible you will get side effects don’t stress, plan b makes you act like you are pregnant. Exactly like you are pregnant. I have taken plan b more than once and it has not failed me. I also advice to NOT take plan b as a regular contraceptive. Get on birth control it’s always available especially at Planned parenthood. Use condoms! Make sure they are stored somewhere safe and not at risk of being ripped. Wallets, glove boxes and pockets is not a good idea! Keep it in like a drawer or cabinet for safe keeping.

I had gotten off my period the day before so I wasn’t super worried I figured I'd get it on time and then I didn’t. I also was scared because about a week laterI started looking online and realized I was over the weight limit by a few pounds so I was freaking out even more. But I missed an entire month and just got it today so I’m writing to say that you may be freaking out so much because I was convinced that I was pregnant I took 6 pregnancy tests all negative but still felt so many pregnancy symptoms. I had no weird symptoms from plan b at all except sore boobs about a week after so ladies if you are worrying stop! if you took the pill on time and the right way you will be ok just give it time!,marie

994,Levonorgestrel,Emergency Contraception,10.0,,"January 4, 2020",10,"Plan B (levonorgestrel):My boyfriend and I had unprotected sex....apparently right as I had ovulated. Took the pill 6 hours later and ended up pregnant. I love my little girl to death and she is absolutely amazing, so I’m glad it all happened. But, please be advised that if you have already ovulated, the pill does not necessarily work. You must take the pill pre-ovulation for it to work. It does not stop ovulation from happening, but delays the process of releasing an egg. Therefore, if you’ve ovulated, you’re too late. There are a lot of misconceptions out there about this being a magic pill that works every time. Although it works 95% of the time, there is still that 5% chance of getting pregnant. Get on some regular birth control or use condoms, because plan b is never a guarantee!",B

I took plan b the first day of my period (I had unprotected sex with my bf the day before). I experienced no symptoms for about 2 weeks after taking the pill. But the next 2 weeks were some of the most excruciating days of my life. I experienced headaches, nausea, and insomnia at record highs. I was beyond nervous that i was pregnant even though my ovulation timeline didn’t line up. I was supposed to get my period on January 1, 2020. Instead I got it just one day later. So for anyone reading this, relax. Stress and anxiety fill your head with doubt and can make symptoms more daunting than they really are. This pill worked for me but I had to give it less than a 10 review because of my symptoms. Going forward, stay protected and have a little faith.",Anonymous

Afterwards, I spotted brown blood and felt bloated for about a week. I was also moody and got the feeling that I had to throw up. But don’t worry, this is a completely normal side effect. Symptoms of plan b and pregnancy are the exact same since the hormone used in plan b is the one that is produced when a women is pregnant. Today, I got my period after about a week and half of nail biting. I was worried since I read that it doesn’t work during ovulation, but its almost impossible to know if u are ovulating since there is no way of knowing.

He bought me PlanB, and I took it within an hour. He was super supportive, but me being me I psyched myself out. I read way into every symptom and convinced myself I was pregnant. The day before I got my period (11/15) I took a pregnancy test. It came back negative. That still didn’t convince me. I researched about abortion without parents finding out. I knew I wouldn’t be able to tell my parents and I was so scared. But thankfully I got my period (5 days late though). My advice to anyone stressing right now is to relax and trust the pill.

I would recommend Plan B for an accident maybe once or twice in your lifetime, but definitely not as standard contraception. use birth control/condoms/whatever, as they are cheaper and easier contraception methods, and more effective than this. it is called emergency contraception for a reason.

1184,Levonorgestrel,Emergency Contraception,10.0,,"October 14, 2019",14,Plan B One-Step (levonorgestrel):1. Plan B works by stopping the process of ovulation so if you have taken it after ovulation the chances of it working are lowered 2. If taken on ovulation/after ovulation plan b will slow the egg that’s traveling to your Fallopian tubes trying to make it late for the sperm; if the egg is already in your tubes waiting for sperm plan B will try to slow down the sperm3. Sperm lives in your vagina for 5 days 7 at MOST4. Sperm will only live that long if your cervical fluid is clear and slimey- if any other discharge is coming out of you sperm will most likely die within the first few hours5. Sperm can’t survive in an acidic environment so TEST YOUR VAGINA!6. Precum CAN get you pregnant- the chances are extremely low but there IS sperm in it and urinating  afterwardsDOES NOT wash it out7. I wish you all the best babes and I hope everything turns out in your favor <3 If you DO end up getting pregnant you are not alone!,sammy

Try to remember that the pill gives you a ton of the same side effects as pregnancy, and that you’re not going to become pregnant if the timing isn’t right. If your period is late, take a test to give you some peace of mind, but remember that this pill delays ovulation so it’s very common for it to screw with your cycle as well.

I was under a lot of stress I knew it wouldn't be on time. I took plan b within a half hour of taking  it with food & water. The next morning I had diarrhea & I was nauseated all day. I never vomited. I was careful with what I ate & drank. The day after that (Monday) I felt so dizzy. I had a severe headache & cramping & was more nauseous than before & constipated. I did have the slightest amount of discharge I thought I was imagining it. The day after my stomach issues were better. I barely had anymore cramps & my headache was almost gone. Later on that day I had some spotting that was dark brown & overnight into Wednesday I had a lot of reddish brown discharge. When I woke up I had more & got my period later. My period feels slightly more crampy than usual & a little heavier. Such a relief though. As hard as it is  - try  not to stress. The pill did work for me it'll work for you too.

These reviews really helped ease my mind, as well as staying distracted as not to stress myself out anymore, because we all know stress can delay your period. I had sex on the 29th and got my period 3 days earlier than expected. All of the odds were against me, but I still turned out ok. Trust the pill ladies, it does work while ovulating.

Okay, so I’ve used both Aftera and Plan B (Aftera more times than Plan B) and I’m mainly posting this comment because of something I was incredibly worried about. Apparently, if you are over 160 pounds (I can’t remember the exact weight), levonorgestrel is less likely to work as an emergency pill. Or so that’s what the internet says. This made me feel crazy worried. I thought for sure I was going to end up pregnant.  I had unprotected sex where my boyfriend finished inside of me twice within a couple of hours and I haven’t been on any type of birth control in 5 years including condoms. I took the Aftera pill almost exactly 12 hours later. I had some spotting, and then started my period on the 28th day almost like clockwork. This pill has worked in my experience.",Anonymous

In the mist of all this panic I read the reviews and they calmed me down. Which is why I am writing this. I took the pill 5 hours after unprotected sex, while ovulating and thanks to this pill, I am not pregnant but also learned my lesson.

We couldn’t even remember if he had finished or not! I knew my ovulation was either that day or the next because I track my cycle, so we went and got plan B within an hour. I took one and threw up due to drinking, so we went back and I took another one. The next few weeks were very hellish, only because I had terrible side effects. Nausea, queeziness, fatigue, and the worst depression!! Probably due to taking 2 because I suspected the first didn’t work.

I panicked. After drinking 2 pills I immediately had mild cramps, very tender breasts and a low-key nausea that lasted all the way up to 2 weeks later. No spotting or the like. Very similar to pregnancy symptoms, and needless to say I broke down multiple times crying because of the crazy hormone war inside me. However, my period actually came on time, which was VERY RARE for me because there's always at least several days of difference between each period, or no period at all for 1-2 months. The bleeding wasn't heavy, but I can really feel the cramps this time around, unlike my usual cramps that almost felt like nothing. I feel like the side effects for each pill REALLY VARY for every woman. As for me, it works beautifully, but needless to say the side effects really scared me for a while there lmao",Jamie

I took plan B on May 22nd the day after I had unprotected sex and in the 24 hour time frame. Morning of the 23rd I woke up feeling very nauseous and sick. I even threw up!! Next couple days after that I barely had any appetite and just ate very little. I would have to say that on Saturday 25th I felt the worst I’ve ever felt. (Flu like symptoms) Sunday the 26th  I had a withdrawal bleed that lasted 3 days with some brown spotting. Next several weeks to follow I had cramps just felt very off. I seriously thought I was pregnant.  June 11th I was supposed to get my period but it never came. I prayed about this and I asked god for help. So I went to planned parenthood and they gave me a pregnancy test and reassured me that I was not pregnant. What a relief. I learned a lesson here and now I will be taking regular birth control pills and using condoms. Also my period came today June 19th so it was delayed by 8 days.,Suzanne13

So I had an oops about 6 days after my period had ended so about 30 minutes after the incident I took a Plan B. I didn’t get any of the nauseousness or tiredness I felt totally fine. About 5 days after taking the pill I had spotting that started pinkish into a full heavy bleeding almost like a period for about 3-4 days. I assume this was breakthrough bleeding from the pill which was a common side effect. May 24th was supposed to be my period but that came and went. Finally after weeks of stress yesterday which would be the 10th of June very heavy and aches period began. For all those who take it and are nervous about it it seems that late periods and early periods are a common side-effect.

Ladies... this drug is the SAME EXACT thing as Plan B. All of the ingredients are exactly the same and the only reason it cost less is because generic meds are funded and advertised differently. In fact, I am sure many of you are on generic birth control pills or have been prescribed generic antibiotics in the past and they all work just the same. We also don't know the details of the comment poster's sex life, meaning if they are having regular sex, they could have fallen pregnant either before of after taking emergency contraception and blame the unintended pregnancy on the pill not working.

Don't remember side effects the first time, but that was years ago so who knows. This time, I had sex a day after my period started and popped the Plan B pill early the next morning. It's been 5 days and I hate it and myself. I'm moody, and I started a second period yesterday. I feel like it makes me smell bad - I feel  others can smell it, even after I've showered. I feel like the smell is coming out of my pores almost. I'm crampy and had a hell of a headache yesterday. I'm tired, occassionally feel something that is not quite what I would call dizzy, and have a lack of appetite which is extremely odd for me. I'm getting sterilized so I don't have to take this rubbish ever again. Pro side, I doubt I'm pregnant and it did save me some panic attacks. Others recommend not reading online, but it's helped reassure me a lot. Google the $10 coupon to at least save a bit.",Munin

From my past experience I have always had irregular periods and plus I was on birth control 4 years ago which were the Depo Shot and the ring. After taking Plan B from my last experiences my period always came 3-4 days after but this recent time it took 6 days. I learned that depression and stress can really delay your period from coming. I  recommend to do something to distract your mind and relax like a hike because that made my period come. Me and my boyfriend  where really nervous and what also helped us was calling the help line with Plan B because you can speak with a physician which helped us relax. I did not get many side effects from the pills the first few days but my most common side effect was headaches and some stomach ache.",Lyn
1482,Levonorgestrel,Emergency Contraception,10.0,,"May 8, 2019",8,"Plan B (levonorgestrel):Plan B really is a good option for anyone that needs it for an emergency. It isn’t a 100% and I’m not going to tell you it is but the failures are a small percentage and increase the later you take it- it works best in the first 12 hours.  I went to and Ob/Gyn let me tell you they know what they are talking about a lot more than the internet, I urge you to talk to one if you’re nervous about pregnancy. My story was very hectic and scary I took a Plan B the day after unprotected sex, he didn’t ejaculate inside me but I was still scared because I was fertile. About 5 days after the pill I had bad mood swings and a three day period. Right after that I got sick with strep throat and a sinus infection, and I didn’t end up getting a true period for a month and a half. So trust in the pill and you can always get an IUD for emergency contraception  as well if you were fertile or it is longer than the first couple of days as that is even more effective and better chance of working.

I did not sleep for one minute all night because my anxiety was so severe. This lasted for about 5 days and it was only through medication and family/friend support that I was able to even cope. It was awful. The doctors said it probably wasn’t the contraceptive but I’m sensitive to hormones and there is no way it didn’t play a part in what happened.

This happened about 9 days after ovulation so I already had something going for me. I continued to freak out for 5 days. My symptoms were along the lines of fatigue, some nausea, pretty intense lower back aches, mild cramping and bloating. My family and friends told me I would be fine but I didn’t believe them! It wasn’t until today that I started spotting, and I’m only 2 days late. As the day went on, it gradually became a light flow!  I am currently still experiencing the back pain and pretty harsh cramps (not abnormal for me as I have PCOS and endometriosis).

Next thing you know I am just frantically going to Walgreens and taking the pill 30-40 minutes later. I didn’t know when I ovulate because I stopped breastfeeding and no period since birth. First day went fine but the second day I suffered depression for weeks. And the symptoms are like pregnancy symptoms.  I started to feel woozy some days (like morning sickness) felt back pains.  And the symptoms don’t last just a week or couple of days it’s been 4 weeks my period came 7 days after taking the pill. I still didn’t believe it thinking it could just be the symptoms why?

We were in the heat of the moment and had ran out of condoms.. So we ended up having sex anyway. He used the pull out method but the next day we were kind of nervous only to find out I was ovulating so he went to cvs and bought aftera. I’ve used plan b before and these side affects that I had with aftera were way different. I’ve never experienced this in my life. I don’t ever cramp and this abdominal pain was the worst I can take pain but this was the worst pain ever!! I told myself I would never use this again! I ended up getting the period it makes you get which was on December 22nd 2018 it lasted 4days. Which is normal for me but it now February 13th 2019 and I still have yet to get my period again since taking the pill..

The  Jan 7-10 I had unexpected bleeding. I had some cramps but they were light and the flow was not as heavy as my period. After this I had clear white discharge the entire time. My breasts were sore for 17 days. They usually get sore 8 days before my period. But never for this long and the soreness was way more intense than usual.

I thought it was the side effects from the plan B as I turns out I was pregnant! It was the best thing to ever happen to us! We were both excited and now we love playing with our nearly two year old.

I had unprotected sex with a man I wasn't serious with at the time and I really needed to be sure I wouldn't get pregnant. In the 30 days following the pill, I bled pretty heavily for a total of 20 days--4 days, then a break, 4 days, another break, and then 3 days. In that time, I read a research article that stated that the pill might be less effective for anyone who is overweight and I was overweight at the time (so that made me feel great about spending 50 bucks). Over the last 12 months since then, I have only had three periods. At most, prior to the pill, I had only ever missed one month at a time. I obviously did not get pregnant, which was the goal, but I would NOT do it again and I would only recommend it to a friend if she was truly desperate and understood all the information regarding the potential effectiveness and side effects.",someone else

I was so ashamed about this but I now feel powerful exercising my reproductive rights (seriously, science is awesome and I'm so gratetful to have access to such a pill).

I then started my cycle about 15 days earlier than usual which I assumed was normal because I think it says it can either make your period early or late. Anyway my period has lasted about 9 days now (and counting!!). This seems insane to me considering my periods usually don’t even last the full 5 days. I have also had breast tenderness  since I even took the pill and got really bad cramps during the first few days of my period. In the end I guess it got the job done because I’m not pregnant.

There is only a 5% failure rate if taken in those first 24 hours. Other reasons why there are stories where females get pregnant and saying that the pill ''doesn't work'' can be if they have taken it too late or  not many of them know this, but if you're overweight 165> the pill will be less effective, you may need to take a double dose (discuss this with Dr or Pharmacist)",Jay

I was sure I was pregnant and scared. I really got early pregnancy symptoms just like my first and only pregnancy.

So me and a friend hooked up one weekend, unprotected, he did not ejaculate inside me but he did finish on top of my vagina and he did precum a lot and I got nervous because I thought maybe it had got inside me. So about 24 hours later I took a Plan B One Step. I came here to look at real comments because I kept seeing negativity reviews  on Youtube and it actually caused me not to stress at all. I had an irregular period as well and about 3 weeks before taking the pill I had been on my period . But exactly 5 days after I took the pill I finally came on my period! I did not have any symptoms but the first day I was excessively  eating but after that I was completely normal! The one thing about this pill is you cannot stress! Give it time and read all the steps. Also if you do not want to get pregnant or have any scares, just use protection ladies - lesson learned by me ! Good luck.",Ladybuglizzy

After my period being 10 days late it finally came today and it’s such a relief. Please if you took Plan B and are scared don’t be. It’s a large dose of hormones which will cause pregnant like symptoms but changes are there is a 99% chance you aren’t pregnant. DO NOT STRESS it prolongs your period. Keep your mind off it.

After so many hours of thinking I took plan b just to be in the safe side about 12 hours later, according to an app it said that my ovulation day was in 5 days and I wasn’t sure if I already ovulated or not, anyway I took it and prevented myself from having sex and here I am after taking plan b with 14 days I received my period, 6 days earlier than expected! I want you all to calm down and let the pill do its work! Its pretty effective when taken within 24 hrs and mostly better within 12 hours of incident!",PlanBworks!

I decided to hop on the bandwagon and write a review if I got my period. Thankfully, here I am, writing this review. I am 18 years old. My boyfriend and I waited 3 years of our relationship to have sex in case a contraceptive fail happened. After having been together for a full 3 years, we had sex! We have been having occasional sex for a while after that and it has been going fine. However, last time, one of our biggest fears came true. The condom broke. At 18 years old, the last thing I want to be is a mom. Him and I have a whole bright future ahead of us. He has gotten many scholarships and has been accepted into a nice college.

2172,Levonorgestrel,Emergency Contraception,9.0,,"June 6, 2017",240,"Plan B One-Step (levonorgestrel):Okay ladies, I have decided to share my experience with Plan B One Step to hopefully help ease even just a few minds, because I know just how bad this situation sucks and how you are searching high and low for some honest feedback. No matter what I say here, you will still be freaking out for a while and overthinking every little thing you feel within your body. Just try your best to be positive and keep busy. Alright, so here goes the story: On Apr. 9 I had sex with a male partner and the condom broke. We didn't notice until the deed was done. Immediately I thought ""omg we are screwed"". I had finished my last period on Apr. 4 (I was now dangerously close to ovulation). The next morning (approx 6-7 hrs later) we went to the pharmacy to get emergency contraception. I took the pill immediately WITH FOOD. The food part is very important. The pill can make you nauseous and if you vomit soon after taking it, it obviously will not work. The pill contains very high levels of Levonorgestrel, a synthetic version of the hormone Progestin (aka the pregnancy hormone). When you become pregnant, your body produces high levels of Progestin, which prevents your ovaries from releasing an egg (because you wouldn't want your body to be ovulating while you are already pregnant). So, in a sense, the pill tricks your body into thinking it is pregnant and therefore your ovaries do not release an egg for the sperm that is now inside of you to fertilize. The effectiveness of this all comes down to timing. The pill's job is to temporarily stop ovulation, so if you have already ovulated, the chances of it working are lowered. This doesn't mean you are totally screwed! There isn't much conclusive evidence (that I have been able to find) but it is said that even shortly after ovulation, the pill can help prevent a newly fertilized egg from implanting in the uterine wall. It is important to follow the advice to take the pill within 72hrs of the incident because sperm can live inside of you for approx 5 days and the longer you let it go, the closer you get to ovulating and the better chance those little suckers have of locating your egg! Back to the fact that the pill temporarily stops ovulation. This means that Plan B is NOT an abortion pill! So whether you are worried to take it because you are pro-life or you are thinking it will terminate an established pregnancy, it WILL NOT DO THIS! The pill's job is to take action before the sperm and egg ever meet.Now onto the stuff that will literally exhaust you... The side effects. I'm going to be honest here and tell you that looking up your side effects is going to make you think you are pregnant for sure. Almost every possible side effect of Plan B mimics the signs of pregnancy. You could experience: nausea, abdominal cramping, fatigue, headaches, dizziness, vomiting, and spotting. If you are concerned about any of these side effects contact your doctor. They will be your best source of support through this. I experienced mild abdominal cramping (like period cramps) the next couple of days after taking the pill and ""spotting"" about a week later. The spotting was what concerned me. When I read that you ""may experience some spotting"" I thought a light little speck here and there, however for me it was almost exactly like one of my periods. My periods are generally quite light (lucky, I know) and my ""spotting"" was almost the exact same, just slightly lighter and lasted about 3-4 days. It started out fairly bright red and then by the last day turned to a darker red, almost brownish colour. I later found out that this is quite normal.Throughout the duration of my worrisome experience, I took 3 home pregnancy tests to help ease my mind a bit. I took one 21 days after the incident, another 6 days later, and then one like 4 weeks after that (just because I was feeling particularly worried that day). All 3 read negative. This helped settle my mind somewhat.Also, a little info that may be a bit TMI, but about 2 weeks after taking the pill I got a yeast infection (see, TMI). On top of worrying about everything else, I now had a painful and embarrassing infection to add to my list! I was freaking out because I wasn't sure what it was at first (painful urination, labia painful to the touch). Upon +++ research on my own, I found out that this is another possible side effect of the pill. The increased hormones in the pill can cause your body to produce an excessive amount of natural yeast. The same thing can happen to women during pregnancy due to the same reason. So if this happens to you, it's uncommon but not unheard of. The biggest worry I had throughout this entire experience was when in the world was I going to get my period?! The pill can and probably will mess with your cycle. It definitely did for me! I'm not sure if it had anything to do with my size, but I'm thinking that it might have. I am fairly petite (115lbs) and the pill is the same dosage for everyone. I ended up missing an entire period! Talk about going out of mind! Everywhere I read said that the pill could delay your period by a week or so, but nowhere could I find anything about it making you skip an entire period! Just as I was mustering up the plan to make a doctor's appointment, my period arrived! Exactly one month late. Again, I can't stress enough to talk to your doctor if something doesn't seem right!I really hope you found some kind of relief in reading this. There is no sure shot way to know Plan B has worked unless you get a blood test from your doctor or are graced with your Aunt Flo so do your absolute best not to worry yourself sick. Remember, stress can have an effect on your cycle as well. I found it most helpful to confide what I was going through in one really good, trustworthy friend who helped bring me back to reality when my worry was spinning me out of control. I hope everything works out for you, and you share your experiences with others going through the same, terrifying experience. Good luck and think positive!",K.M.555

It was my first month off birth control so I was very nervous. I ended up taking the pill 4-6 hours after the incident. We did a lot of research on it and I experienced a few symptoms within the next couple days such as nausea, a little bit of cramping, and I had an induced period from the pill a week later. It was like a regular period except it last roughly four days(short for me). Then the waiting began. I had nearly forgotten about it until I realized it was a past my normal expected period date. I began to panic, even though off my regular pill my periods are irregular. I read too many message boards about taking plan B and still getting pregnant and I had a lot of cry sessions because the only person I could talk to was my boyfriend. I then realized I hadn't been counting from the induced period date and having a normal cycle after that period. I was right on the edge of it being seven days past what my new expected date was and I started to panic again. Let me tell you, it was the most welcomed pain in the world when I finally got it eight days past the expected date a month after the induced period. I had bad cramping for a week leading up to it and really painful cramps the day of. I think stress played a huge role in delaying my period also because I was thinking about it every second of every day.

Here'/ my experience. My boyfriend and I decided to have sex for the first time, and I thought he was wearing a condom but he told me he took it off before he did it. He did not tell me this until after we had sex. I also stupidly did this on my most fertile day (DOUBLE BAD IDEA) I panicked and made him go to Walmart after he was done at the gym to buy Plan B even though he claimed he pulled out in time. I took the pill 2 hours after the event. I had nausea, headaches, mood swings, and cramps. I got my period today after a week of taking the pill. The pill does work!

After I took it I looked at the reviews about it on here and I was feeling more calm about knowing it worked on people. So all I could really do is wait till my period came. I was so devastated the pill didn't work because 3 days later I felt like I was ovulating since I got a lot of discharge. But I had to wait since my period was to come December 8. I had no symptoms at all except a lot of discharge. After 2 weeks my period came 1 day early on December 7. So I was relieved that Plan b one step WORKS!
