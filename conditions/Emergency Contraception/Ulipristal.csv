This is the updated review and I just want to tell you that it worked!! 10 days after taking the pill I finally got my period & I’m not pregnant :)!!

1,Ulipristal,Emergency Contraception,8.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"April 1, 2022",0,"Ella (ulipristal):Had UPS on 9th Feb 3 times in the same 24 hours, took Ella around 17 hours later. Not sure if I was ovulating at the time. I’ve had the worst PMS/pregnancy symptoms from then. I’ve only just got my period today 31st March, so I’ve missed February period. Very scary time but just glad it’s worked.",Emzibobs56
2,Ulipristal,Emergency Contraception,9.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"March 31, 2022",0,"Ella (ulipristal):I had sex just about a week after I got my last period (so around the 3rd or 4th of March) but had to take Ella one because the condom broke (it was my first time taking it). When I took it I didn’t had any symptoms at all but started having them just when I was supposed to get my period. I really thought I might be pregnant due to all of the symptoms I was having: morning sickness symptoms, nausea, horrible headaches, bloating, mood swings, sore breasts, and even discharge. Even one of those days when I was getting back home after playing tennis, I had to find a bench to sit since I was so nauseous and dizzy I felt I was going to faint. Then I found this site and read a lot of other girls’ experiences and it was extremely reassuring and felt more calm. I stopped stressing about and really started to trust the process and finally after 5 days being late, just when I was about to take a pregnancy test, I got my period. The drug WILL mess with your hormones.",S.G
3,Ulipristal,Emergency Contraception,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"March 30, 2022",0,Ella (ulipristal):So I took Ella one 2 days after UPS and stupidly then had UPS a week later and took another. This messed up my period. I had a very heavy period 3 days after for just 2 days then a week later had medium bleeding for 1 week then a week later had serious cramping and spotting. Then fast forward a month my period was late and I got so worried did a pregnancy test and was negative. Then my period came 1 week later than it usually does and was the most horrific pain and heavy bleeding. would never use this again!,dani8989000

5,Ulipristal,Emergency Contraception,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"March 27, 2022",0,"Ella (ulipristal):I took ellaone one day before my ovulation, around 12 hours after unprotected sex. On the day of taking it I didn't have any symptoms but after 4 days I started to have cramps in my lower belly, couple of days later my breast started to be sensitive, next I was feeling nausea. I never have symptoms like that when I'm having PMS so I started to panicking. Everything was pointing on pregnancy. I took maybe 5-6 tests, that was 3 days before period, day of expected period, then every day when period was late. All negative but when I was reading all the opinions that tests might not show it early I was devastated.Finally I got my period 5 days late. Didn't start as normal, but slowly flow was bigger.It did work for me in the end but I think it should be written on the leaflet how it might mess up your hormones. Everywhere is only information that symptoms shows only for couple of days which from all those comments seems like not true. Tablet works most of the time though",Anna

I took the next one the next day (24 hours after UPS and kept it down fine no symptoms! I had no issues until a few days ago period was due and I felt really bad PMS symptoms (nausea, stomach pains, headaches, shivering - I was sure I was pregnant and panicked, period was four / five days late and had two negative tests ! On day 4 light pink spotting which Googling wasn’t a good idea as it said implantation bleeding ! However the next day I got my period it came very slow and first and now seems ok !

7,Ulipristal,Emergency Contraception,,,"March 23, 2022",0,Ella (ulipristal):I had an abortion March 8th and after two weeks I had UPS March 21st. I started taking my birth control pills again 3 days prior having sex but it takes a while for birth control to actually become effective. So I didn’t rely on my birth control. I started to freaking out and ordered Ella online. I took the pill the next day around 11 a.m after picking it up. I’ve experienced some cramping but I’m not sure if it’s from my abortion (which you can experience cramping even after 2 weeks of having one) or it’s it’s from the pill. I will write another review and let y’all know if it worked or not!! Fingers crossed.,Anonymous

My period was late, but started spotting brown discharge 2 days after my period was due. I was spotting for 6 days, before my actual period came!

I bled more than usual & it gave me stronger mood swings & irritability. I didn’t have a bad reaction like many of the other girls did in the reviews, so I would recommend it to anybody that has had UPS.

It was 6 days before my ovulation. Read online that sperm stays in the body for 6 days and was a lil paranoid however, I kinda trusted Ella as it’s my second time taking. Period was supposed to come on the 2nd of March but I expected it to be late a day or 2. However it didn’t come and on day 5, I was stressed already. As the days passed, I tried finding remedies online like consuming vitamin C, parsley, cinnamon but then came day 7 and it was not here. I started full on panicking, praying at every chance I had and I started to search up on abortion procedures. Decided to take a test on day 9 and it was negative. I felt a bit better but worried it was a false negative. However, my period finally came on Day 10 and I was elated. I hope the pill works for everyone reading this and stay safe!!",Ana

Last period before UPS was 24th of Jan. I had UPS 5th of Feb and according to my Flo app I would’ve been ovulating during that time. I took Ella about 38 hours later (7th if Feb). I had a terrible headache, insomnia and some mood swings the week after. The anxiety I had was through the roof while waiting for my period to come. I had finally gotten my period 21st of Feb, normal period but maybe a day shorter than usual. Today, 14th of March, I had the copper IUD placed in me.

Was going to schedule in a doctors appointment but luckily my period arrived today weeks later. The PMS was bad, the bloating, the cramps, the mood swings tender breasts was really bad.

I just wanted to share my experience and get your opinions as I am so anxious at the moment. I had protected sex near my ovulation date (according to Flo) but the condom broke, so just for extra security I took an Ella one pill 15 hours later. My period was due in 3 weeks after taking the pill, but my period never came, few days go by, no period, not even spotting and no pregnancy signs, 2 weeks go by and still no period, so my anxiety was sky high as I obviously don’t wanna be pregnant right now haha! So I decided to take a pregnancy test and it was negative. I’m now 18 days late! No signs of pregnancy, no signs of a period, I’m about to take my 2nd pregnancy test. I absolutely don't taking Ella One for this reason. It always makes me incredibly anxious as it messes the cycle up and my hormones too,  I hope you guys aren’t going through anything like this, but any advice would be so appreciated!

19,Ulipristal,Emergency Contraception,9.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"February 15, 2022",1,"Ella (ulipristal):Worked for me indeed, but it definitely made my whole month feel insane. I had terrible PMS symptoms that seemed to get worse around the timing of the period. It got quite crazy and depressive in the sense that the paranoia is amplified as well as the rest of the symptoms that come with it - anxiety, fatigue, random nausea and dizziness, irritability, cramps, bloating, headaches. Yes, you will feel it until you get your period, that's the only downside to this pill but it has my trust, it works if you use it within the right time frame. During that time, ensure you drink heaps of water, get loads of love and support and giggles from your friends, exercise PLEASE as it curbs so many of the side effects that you will get. Most of all, stay safe xx",Meel

I took Ella approximately 48 hours later. (Had ups 3-5am Sunday morning and again at 7-8am Sunday morning, took pill on Tuesday morning around 3pm in the afternoon for context)I had some symptoms (headache, nausea, but found out later I also had a UTI so these could’ve been symptoms from that I’m not sure but I felt horrible after taking Ella for about 2-3 days) then it went away and no other symptoms at all. Period came on the day the period app predicted as usual. Will take a pregnancy test anyway after my period goes off just to be sure but this seems like a regular period so I’m pretty sure I’m not pregnant. Would definitely recommend this pill!! Especially if you had UPS on or close to ovulation. Even with minor side effects that you’re likely to experience if you are pregnant and even worse symptoms actually, it’s definitely worth it.",Ashley

I had worried a lot because my girlfriend according to the flo app was due to ovulate in two days, and reading reviews online says it loses it’s effectiveness around time of ovulation. My girlfriend took the pill less that 15 hours after, but my concern was what if the app was wrong and she had already ovulated. Her period came today after a week delay, apart from that she had no side effects.Just breathe and take it easy.

As you all could imagine, I was TERRIFIED. I didn't think Plan B would be strong enough due to my weight+the ovulation period. I was able to order it through a random website and I was able to pick it up at my pharmacy the same day I ordered it.Side effects: about 2 hours after taking it, I felt dizzy, loopy, and zoned out.

Ladies, I know the stress can be overwhelming. But you took the responsible action and we have to accept that we all make mistakes sometimes. Just remember that this drug does not protect you against STDs and it's not a regular contraception method. But don't panic and blame yourself for your actions. Remember, you are a responsible person and you took emergency contraception so there is no cause for blaming yourself.  Trust the drug, it works most of the time.",cherry

Got my period a few days before the 3 week mark, and since it came late (although I'm irregular, it was on the later side of my ""normal"") I went through the little mental panic that a lot of users have described. Even when my period came, I first questioned if it was implantation bleeding (but it was too red and heavy to be that, as I soon learned). Thankfully, other reviews put me more at ease and I'm glad I was able to access the medication when I did.

Took EllaOne less than an hour after broken condom. Going by my Flo app this was ovulation day.

My period came slightly earlier than predicted by Flo app and so far much heavier than normal but this is a small price that I am more than willing to pay!!

Reading this thread calmed me so much so I just wanted to share my experience in the hope that it would help someone else. My last period began on 22nd Oct and I had UPS on 5th Nov. Typically I have a (very regular) 31 day cycle so 5th Nov was potentially the day of ovulation according to the Flo app. I took EllaOne within 12hrs of having UPS. A few days before my expected period I started to experience bloating along with dull pain in my back and pelvis. However my period did not arrive and after a couple of negative pregnancy tests it has now started 9 days late. In terms of side effects it has basically felt like extreme PMS for the past few weeks (the back/pelvis pain continued intermittently until my period began and I’ve also experienced major mood swings along with headaches and fatigue). To summarise, don’t let the fact that you may have been ovulating deter you from taking the pill and do not panic if your period is late! Good luck x",Anonymous

I had UPS on 26th September and took Ella 19 hours after as I was paranoid about precum. Fast forward I finally have my period! I could have cried with happiness as I was convinced I was pregnant. Ladies do not stress Ella works but it will definitely delay your period (I did not have my period in October so definitely late!) and you will have the worst PMS - it’s a learning curve but definitely will not want to go through this again. Your body knows when it is stressing and that only delays your period more. Moral of this - Ella works you just have to be patient.

We decided to take a pill 7 hours after it happened. I didn’t have almost any symptoms, except for mild headache.

But then I found this group and read other experiences and realized I’m not the only one going through this hell. I was sure my period is going to be late because of pill and stress but luckily I got it yesterday, exactly when I was supposed to. This was 11 days after UPS.

Thankfully my period came 6 days early, because this pill had me crying with terrible mood swings. I will never take this pill again. If you are reading this, and have ups and need a back up, please consider the Copper IUD as your emergency contraception. You can use it up to 5 days after ups at any time of your menstrual cycle. It works even if have ovulated. It will stop implantation right in it's tracks. If you cannot get into your OBGYN within 5 days, go to Planned Parenthood and they will squeeze you in as an emergency.

I was so sure I was pregnant, I started crying a lot, not sleeping, not even eating, I also took a pregnancy test but it came out negative. After reading all of these comments I calmed down a bit. After 5 days I got brownish discharge I thought it was implantation bleeding but no, I got my period the day after, 3 days early before my supposedly cycle.

Just like other girls I promised myself I'd let everyone know my experience once I either got my period back or confirmed a pregnancy. Context is that my boyfriend was supposed to be away for 6 months and I decided to use that time to test being off hormonal birth control - he unexpectedly came back early. My last period finished around March 12. He came back and we had UPS  a few times around April 3, a few days before my period was supposed to start. He did pull out but I got paranoid so we got Ella. Fully missed my April period and just now got my May period on May 13. I think if you take this pill after ovulation/close to your period it will make you fully skip it like mine!

I only later realised that I had been two days away from ovulating so then I started to panic about whether the pill would work, since some people say is isn't effective if you have already ovulated.

I was experiencing some lower abdomen pain and I was a little scared and not sure if pill had worked. To make it worse.  I even missed the next cycle which was due in Jan. I finally got my periods on 17th Feb. My advice is the pill really messed up with your cycle but works. Take home pregnancy test if you miss your periods after taking the pill   it will help you with the stress. I know how it feels when you miss two periods in a row   .My take is trust the pill.

I could only wait 15 days for my period which I didn't get at that date so I took a blood test but the doctor said there is a chance for it to be wrong; so I waited more and it was so stressful and the only thing kept me calm a bit was reading this site's comments so I promised myself to share my experience after the stressful days come to an end.  I got my period 5 days later (was lighter than usual) and honestly I don't know if it was the drug or me stressing too much for more than 2 weeks.

I also experienced twinges in my lower belly, and breast pain/swelling which lasted for eleven days. I experienced constipation, and didn’t experience the usual painful cramps that precede my period. In the end, my period arrived only one day late, but it was lighter than usual. I took three pregnancy tests - all turned out negative.

The app said I was at 1dpo, but apps CANNOT be trusted with predicting ovulation accurately. Condom slippage happened during withdrawal, and a few drops leaked inside of me. Within 40mins I took EllaOne, had some pain in the ovary from which I usually ovulate. Note: It's very possible I was actually GOING TO ovulate, I had all the symptoms. I thought I already ovulated and I was going to get pregnant anyway. I get your anxiety! I'm lucky for such a supportive boyfriend. A pregnancy would ruin any chance of me getting into medical school. Turned out my period was 3 days late. To anyone going through anxiety and stress because of this: THIS PILL IS THE MOST EFFECTIVE ON THE MARKET, but take it ASAP. Don't waste time. If you already ovulated, it thickens cervical mucus and thins the endometrium so pregnancy is unlikely. I believe women who become pregnant even on the pill most likely do for waiting too much.

The leaflet said it will stop conception if taken in 5 days and that it wouldn't work if you are already pregnant. And if pregnant it will not affect the pregnancy. I turned out pregnant. And I accepted the fact that I got pregnant within 2 hours and was ready to face it . But I suffered a miscarriage at week 7. I have had a normal pregnancy before and no history of miscarriages. I took prenatal vitamins  As soon as I started pregnancy symptoms even be4 i tested positive, and took good care of myself in every possible way. Still had a miscarriage. It may be due to some other reason, may not be just the tablet. But the guilt and hurt feeling after having a miscarriage for first time its really hard to take. My advice is to keep track of ur ovulation and never take Ellaone if u might have ovulated.

I had UPS with my boyfriend and realised my Flo app said it was ovulation day! Absolutely panicked and took Ella 12 hours after tho I was still so worried as I read it you have ovulated Ella won’t work. I’ve read up a lot about this and it actually has 2 other functions if passed ovulation 1. Thickens cervical mucus to stop sperm getting to egg 2. Makes it difficult for a fertilised egg to implant. Over the weeks had cramps, lots of discharge and mood swings. Took a negative test at 16dpo (days after ovulation) and then eventually 10 days late my period arrived! Also just a note to be careful at calculating ovulation dates. Websites like clear  blue gave me completely different dates.

Took an ovulation strip to ensure I’m not ovulating, my strip showed negative. I had no spotting, no nausea. I was due on my period around June 24th, I spotted ever so lightly on the 1st of July, just pink. I stupidly googled it and implantation bleeding came up. I got an ovulation test kit (mostly because it came with lots of pregnancy tests) the pregnancy test was negative. This then got me questioning why my period never came. Idk if anyone has ever done this but I decided to monitor my LH levels the whole month that I had Ellaone. PEAK positive on 4th of July. I know you can’t ovulate when pregnant so I waited. I started spotting on the 16th and have only started bleeding properly since the night of the 19th. Stay safe. It’s not worth it. Ellaone needs to be clear, it’s not a delay by a few days",2020Mama

I've been using the pull out method, but over New year's, I had several nights unprotected encounters. I was able to get Ella on Monday. I was scared that I had passed the time frame for Ella to work. My period due date was January 16th. I thought I was pregnant for sure! My breasts were really full and tender, I was a little nauseous and I was salivating like I did when I was pregnant with my last 2 kids. The other experiences said don't stress, but they had all been in the 24-36 hour time frame. I was trying to decide when I should start thinking about getting a pregnancy test, I was sure I had missed the opportunity with Ella. I was stressing a lot!!! But yesterday the 14th, 2 days before I was due to have my period; I started! Thank you Ella!! It's true what they say, try not to stress about the symptoms you are having. It will work!!!

Within about 36 hours, I met with a doctor who could prescribe some form of emergency contraception (EC). Where I live, these are not so readily available so please do your research as soon as possible if you think you're interested in using EC. For me, it was simple, I would rather be safe than sorry. You have the right to protect yourself. Symptoms-wise, the second day I was extremely dizzy, fatigued. On the fourth day, I had developed a serious yeast infection. It's unclear whether I developed a yeast infection as an after effect of the sexual encounter or as a result of hormonal changes in part due to the EC. Fast forward to today, I'm on day 36 of my cycle and just trying to patiently wait. I am super anxious and will be getting a home pregnancy test to use tomorrow, but will report back again.",Tango

My period didn't arrive on time & after 5 days, I began to worry that Ella had failed. At 7 days late I tested, which was negative. I was advised by a pharmacist to take another test in 7 days if my period had not arrived by then. I did this and had a second negative test. Now 16 days after the date my period was due, I have FINALLY come on. Although it is much heavier and painful.Thankfully Ella worked so 10/10 for that. But for the additional worry, the extreme lateness of my period & feeling out of sorts its 5/10I have taken different brands of ECP occasionally in the past & they have never affected my cycle like Ella did. The main thing is that it did the job - just be aware that it can change your cycle.",Danielle

It was more painful than usual but the sigh of relief I had was greater than any of that pain. So don't worry. If you have taken the pill within 5 days of your accident, YOU ARE NOT LIKELY  PREGNANT. You might experience a lot more PMS than usual and stressing more will delay your period further. Although it did the job, I would not recommend this pill.

I just could only  think of the worst as it would be the end of the world for me, I took a test and came out negative but I was still suspicious I was always sick until the period came normally so just to say that this was the worst thing I've ever been through.

My period ended on a Wednesday and I had unprotected sex on Saturday and since I wasn't on any birth control for over a year I thought I would be better safe than sorry and took Ella on Sunday morning. The 1st week I just felt a little light headed and tired, 2nd week  I started to get some weird stabbing pain on my left side, 3rd week my breasts were painfully sore and doubled a size and I started to bloat (it looked like I was already 3 months pregnant) and all my lower stomach hurt, i was gassy, and the stabbing pain continued but by now it was spreading also to the right side. By this time I was also feeling nauseous from all the anxiety. After two negative pregnancy tests my period finally arrived a week late!!!

The condom broke and my boyfriend came inside of me on my ovulation day. My periods are pretty regular and the chances are big that the ovulation app Flo was right and there was a high chance of getting pregnant. Anyway, we saw what happened and ran to the pharmacy to get EC and bought Ellaone - they said this one works better than plan B if you are ovulating. I took it like one hour after our contraception failure. There were no symptoms during the first day. The next day I felt cramps and urinary burning, overall fatigue and my breasts were extremely sore. For the next 2 weeks I was stressing out so much, losing sleep and reading about all kinds of scenarios.  I got really bad acne rushes and my breasts are still aching, but today I got my period!!!

377,Ulipristal,Emergency Contraception,,Taken for less than 1 month,"July 10, 2019",6,Ella (ulipristal):Just want to comment to those using the pull out method that seems to be really popular. Please do not do this! Pre ejaculate is  potent and can get you pregnant just like the ejaculation itself. A lot of men also seem to forget to pull out. There is absolutely nothing to lose for males and there are a lot of awful men who only care about themselves and their pleasure. The pull out method is not effective and you’re the only one who has anything to lose. These side effects aren’t worth it and you should not take emergency contraception too often because it becomes less effective. Please use a condom and consider other methods to back it up. There are male hormonal contraceptives in production that'll wreck less havoc on a male’s body than what the hormonal pills do to women.,SaraJ

387,Ulipristal,Emergency Contraception,9.0,,"June 15, 2019",32,"Ella (ulipristal):EllaOne is a hormonal pill. By taking this drug you are putting hormones into your body to delay ovulation or prevent an egg from implanting. Any drug that is strong enough to do that is strong enough to mess with nature's natural way of regulating a healthy menstrual cycle, so ladies, if your period is late its fine! Especially if the pill has worked & your ovulation has been delayed, its only logical for your period to be late. Even if you find your period is early after taking the pill and the next one is very late, again remember what I said about the hormones, that too is normal. By the second week after I took the pill, I was surer than sure that I was carrying. I had the sore boobs, back ache,  nausea, my period was late I was moody and most of all, I was fatigued.

When I had sex it was day 13 of my cycle so most fertile time. Took it on the 14th April and was due on my period the 23rd. Very common side affect is that it makes your period late so this is what I was expecting however it got to around the 30th and still no period - took a pregnancy test and it came back negative.  Decided to take another pregnancy test on the 5th May and again it came back negative- I was very confused as to what had happened to my cycle and if the test results were false. However a week later on the 11th my period finally came! So in total I was around 19 days late-  Stressing out as well will delay it and I think that may have been what also caused mine to arrive late.

I was also told that this pill could cause my period to be up to five days late and if it is any longer I should take a pregnancy test.

I had unprotected sex which was foolish in itself and then later realised that I had it on my predicted day of ovulation. Cue panic. Got ellaone about twelve hours later, it was pricey (35 euro) but I was desperate and had major anxiety about the whole thing. The side effects became apparent almost immediately for me, and they weren’t fun. I had nausea, extreme fatigue, back pain, cramps, bloating , the lot. These lasted for about four days.  I hadn’t felt sick like I had on ellaone for a long time but fast forward two weeks and it has all been worth it. My period came today, late by four days but it’s here and I have such relief. Ellaone will compromise your cycle, and I think this period is worse than my more recent ones but ellaone has got your back.",Notter

I also had nausea & 5 days before period was due I took a pregnancy test which came back positive. I refused to believe it so waited until period was late & tested again- again it was positive. I then started to accept it & planned with my partner who was very excited. I made my first midwife appointment & took the last test I had left just for fun. It was negative.

Straight after taking it I'm feeling a bit sore and a bit tired with headaches and some mood swings - but I've been reading that this is totally normal and I don't worry too much. HOWEVER - I'm quite regular with my cycles and I have never ever felt different when ovulating, I literally experience no symptoms at all usually but after taking this pill I can feel a pinching cramp on the left side of my stomach roughly around 7 days after the accident and feeling light headed and sometimes sick.

I took EllaOne on day 10 on my cycle, 6 hours after the condom broke, I was petrified that it's too late to take and that my ovulation happened in the meantime as my cycles are very regular, of 26 days. But I took EllaOne because I read some reports that it is more effective than Levonorgestrel especially close to actual ovulation. I took Plan B in the past but this was my first experience with EllaOne and the side effects hard not to notice. For the first few days I felt really sleepy, I had cramps here and there like before my period. Then about a week after the pill my breasts got so swollen and sore, I had real discomfort wearing a bra and was still dealing with cramps. Throughout this time I also had some mood swings and later on pretty much regular PMS symptoms. And finally today, on day 28 my period came!!!

The only other two times I had unprotected sex, and didn't take ella, I fell pregnant!There is some dispute whether ella still works if you have just ovulated before taking it, as ella's main function is to delay ovulation to give the sperm time to die. However, I am reliably informed by my doctors that ella does also create an inhospitable environment in the womb, which can prevent implantation, although this isn't as reliable as delaying ovulation.In my most recent case, I took ella just before I ovulated. I was worried it might be too late to delay ovulation but I took LH tests daily and, sure enough, I ovulated several days later than expected.

I believe it has such horrible side effects because it is comprised of the same chemical structure as the abortion pill, it just acts on your ovaries instead of the endometrium. My ovaries HURT. I felt a pulling sensation on my uterus the entire time which made it extremely hard to sleep. I got all of the same symptoms that I did when I was pregnant last year- fatigue, nausea, aversion to smells, loss of appetite, sore boobs, v painful uterus, numbness in legs and feet, dizziness. I also kept missing turns and exits while driving, which I never do- especially in my own town.I felt like I was dying with the flu the whole time the medication was active in my system, and then suddenly, at 2am on day 6, all of my symptoms spontaneously ended in an instant.

I absolutely know what it feels like to be worried and stressed so please try your best to stay calm. So anyway, I had unprotected sex and the next morning I took the morning after pill, EllaOne (after 13-14 hours). I was probably ovulating at the time I had sex so I was freaking out so much, you have no idea. I started smoking a lot and eating so little due to stress and every time I got a cramp here and and there I thought to myself ""OMG I must be pregnant"". Got the ClearBlue pregnancy test and tested 6 days before my expected period. Negative! Done a second test 4 days before my expected period. Negative! After doing my second pregnancy test I happened to get my period a few hours later that day! So of course, relieve! The stress was gone! So anyway I was expecting my second period to come but it didn't and I started googling so much things. Every hour of the day and I was absolutely going psycho, I used to hide and cry, smoke too much again, eat nothing and the stress was making me sick. Of course, I googled pregnancy symptoms: lower back pain, cramps, so I went psycho and thought oh my god I must be pregnant. But calm, the exact same symptoms are also due to stress and anxiety! I then went and done another pregnancy test. Negative! (It would've been about a month and a bit after I had unprotected sex). I was stress free for a day then again, Google screwed with my head and told me that I was basically pregnant when I wasn't! Was still waiting for my period and it wasn't coming and then I started getting discharge. It was different textures every day: crumbly, egg white etc. and then this followed by brown discharge. I absolutely freaked out and Google told me that if I had brown discharge I could be pregnant. I went and done another pregnancy test (negative), but this wasn't enough for me because I was already gone psycho so I spoke to the pharmacist and broke down in tears and told her I was so scared. She said to me that the morning after pill had so much hormones that can delay or make your period come early. The brown discharge is basically dried blood that couldn't come out. It's because of the morning after pill playing with your hormones. Two days later, psycho me, I had a doctors appointment, told her about my story she done a pregnancy test (negative) and ensured me that I was not pregnant and told me the same things that the pharmacist had told me, the brown discharge is due to the pill and that my period could be irregular for a few months. I was calm for a day. Got home, started googling so much stuff and I freaked out again so I had to return to her for a blood test because that is 100% accurate. So anyway I got my results today and I am not pregnant! Now I'm going to patiently wait for my next period to arrive!So to the girls out there that don't want to get pregnant and have taken the morning after pill within the necessary time.
