0,Bevacizumab,Glioblastoma Multiforme,4,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"June 28, 2020",12,"Avastin (bevacizumab):My husband did not respond to chemo and radiation for the brain tumor.  He was put on Avastin every 2 weeks. At first he had no side effects and the brain tumor was shrinking but I did not see any improvements in his functioning. Around his seventh dose, he threw up once. The 8th dose, he threw up blood and could not even take a sip of water without vomiting. He was hospitalized and passed away the next day. The doctor could not say if it was due to the treatment. My husband was already very ill. This was a chance we had to take.",Anonymous

Practically dragging himself with my support across the room to use the bathroom. After the first dose of Avastin we seen he felt a dramatic change. Within two and a half days he was able to walk by himself. Second treatment day after we will see how my honey does!,CL
2,Bevacizumab,Glioblastoma Multiforme,10,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"September 12, 2015",7,"I had stage 4 gliosarcoma in March and wasn't supposed to make it very long. After surgery, aggressive radiation and 3 rounds of 400mg Temidar (pardon the spelling), my first MRI showed the tumor was growing back. My oncologist put me on bi-monthly drips of Avastin to go with the Temidar. My second MRI showed a 30% decrease in the size of my tumor. My legs are weak, but I'll take it!! Thank God for Avastin and the oncologist. I am the first person I know of that was given Avastin for Gliosarcoma.",RickyL

In just two months I've seen dramatic improvements with minimal side effects (constipation, nose bleeds and mouth sores) all of which have responded to simple remedies) My last brain scan was a large improvement over the prior one and I've reduced my Dexamethasone dose substantially! I highly recommend!",djdg

After four treatments, the tumor has shrunk by 65%!! My mom is very tired though, that is the main side effect she is experiencing. She takes several naps everyday but is otherwise completely fine. We are currently seven months from her diagnosis.",Anonymous

7,Bevacizumab,Glioblastoma Multiforme,6,,"February 2, 2010",90,"Avastin (bevacizumab):I started Avastin in November of 2009 after my spinal cord tumor started growing again. I was diagnosed with brain cancer in February 2009. The tumor is in my spinal cord, not in my brain. It effects my right leg. Makes it weak. I had surgery and went through radiation and chemo in April. The tumor was shrinking all summer and then started to grow again. In November 2009, I started Avastin as an addition to the existing Chemo called Temodar. As soon as I started Avastin, the tumor started to shrink, but my symptoms got way worse. So, I have a shrinking tumor, but side effects that are worse. ",Brad1234
