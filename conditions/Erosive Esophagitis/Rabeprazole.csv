1,Rabeprazole,Erosive Esophagitis,10.0,Taken for 5 to 10 years,"May 14, 2012",14,"I tried a number of over the counter medicines and Prevacid, but found no relief.

3,Rabeprazole,Erosive Esophagitis,,,"August 10, 2009",24,Aciphex (rabeprazole):Was relieved to see that someone else has used this drug even longer than I have. I've been on it for 9 years with erosive esophagitis. I've rarely had any symtoms and can eat anything. I haven't been able to find any studies of long time use.,Cherypd
4,Rabeprazole,Erosive Esophagitis,10.0,,"August 30, 2008",13,"Aciphex (rabeprazole):In my experience Aciphex proved far superior to the generic brand I was given. I don't know the technical difference, but  Aciphex (taken once in AM & once in PM) alleviated the painful burnings in my stomach and up to my throat within a few days. The generic form seemed not to work as well or quickly and I suspected as a possible cause of simultaneous depression (which may or may not have been related...)",Anonymous

6,Rabeprazole,Erosive Esophagitis,10.0,,"April 5, 2008",45,Aciphex (rabeprazole):I was on other proton pump inhibitors but had a constant headache while using them. Aciphex relieves my symptoms with no percieved side effects. Great drug and I've been on it for over 10 years. I have no evidence of further esophageal erosion and have been diagnosed by biopsy of having Barrett's esophagus. I can eat anything now.,Gastroenterology nurse
