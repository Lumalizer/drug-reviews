0,Ranitidine,Erosive Esophagitis,1,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"May 28, 2021",1,"Zantac (ranitidine):Famotidine has never helped with erosive esophagitis, I was on Ranitidine for over 20 years which was fast acting and did take care of my problems. The  VA tried Famotidine on me various times but it would not help me, then they went with pantoprazole which has kept my condition at bay.",Pepecorote
1,Ranitidine,Erosive Esophagitis,10,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"December 1, 2018",7,"For years I have suffered with burning acid attacks that are severely painful.  When I take this medication, all of my symptoms are quickly eradicated. It also works well as a preventative measure. Ratinidine is not only the most effective medication when it comes to mediating my pain/symptoms, but it is in fact the most consistently reliable and effective drug I have ever taken.",Donny
