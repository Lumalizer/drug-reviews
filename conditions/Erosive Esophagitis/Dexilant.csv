1,Dexilant,Erosive Esophagitis,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"September 18, 2020",4,"I have terrible pain between my shoulder blades and my chest. I had my gallbladder removed, a year ago, but still feel those same symptoms. With a recent scope, the doctor said I have a very inflamed stomach, took two biopsies (results still unknown) and then prescribed Dexilant 60mg once per day.They make me very sick and dizzy feeling. I did however feel less swelling pain so continued to struggle through taking them during week one. The dizziness has not stop, so since last night, I will take it before bed. I'm not sure if the dosage is too high. I am very tiny so perhaps its too strong for me, but they come in capsules, so I do not know how I could take half a dose, like someone here said they do.",Kimberley
2,Dexilant,Erosive Esophagitis,10.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"April 13, 2020",13,"I was on omeprazole for several years and developed crippling joint problems and my legs swelled up because it was affecting my kidneys so the Dr. took me off. I now have stage 3 kidney failure. The joints got better and I'm back to normal but what I call acid reflux (burning gas in my throat) came back. The Dr tried Zantac and that didn't work so he put me on Dexilent. It works fabulously. It works so well that I take only 1/2 capsule about once a week. (15mg) If I let it go too long and have lots of belching gas, I take the half dose and it calms down in about 5 hours.",Randy
3,Dexilant,Erosive Esophagitis,3.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"August 24, 2019",11,"20 years ago I had a nissan wrap (a type of GERD surgery).  Some dr. said I should not have had it and just taken the meds for control of acid. Since then I have taken different proton pump type meds with good effect. In Jan of this year my specialist who scopes me told me to get off pantprazole, which wasn't easy. In May I went for my Veterans physical and the dr said my throat was red and I might be having some reflux. I started taking pantprazole 20 mg once a day and then up to twice a day 30 mg. I kept getting worse. Now they have me on dexilant 60 mg and I'm having trouble at nights with reflux??????",cliff

7,Dexilant,Erosive Esophagitis,10.0,,"June 27, 2014",50,"I've been taking Dexilant 60 mg. for 10 days now.  It was given to me because I felt like something was stuck in my throat.....esophagitis.  Well it worked taking care of that problem, thank goodness.  After taking for 5 days, I started getting really tired, then headaches.  This week the headaches got worse and couldn't sleep at night.  Also chest, ears, and scalp itching like crazy.  Then today I started having very bad stomach pain.  I thought about all these symptoms on the way home from work and it all added up.  I remembered that each evening I took the pill, about 30 minutes later the itching began and it was terrible.  I didn't take tonight, so hopefully the itching, stomach pain and headache will go away.",julieladybug

9,Dexilant,Erosive Esophagitis,10.0,,"February 3, 2014",41,"I've had acid reflux for 4 years. My doctor recommended Prilosec, etc. None of the over the counter medicines worked. Some mornings, I would wake up with a mouthful of acid. My voice was becoming more horse. On some days I could barely speak and thought I would lose my voice entirely. My latest Doc prescribed Dexilant after giving me some free samples.Within a few days, my throat was better. I've been taking it for 1 month and my voice is almost back to normal. So far, I've had no side effects, but will taper off the medicine so I don't get weakened bones due to lower calcium intake. The doc gave me a discount card, and insurance covers all but $20.00.",SummarDrummer
10,Dexilant,Erosive Esophagitis,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"October 24, 2012",57,"For 10 years, I have had heartburn which I was self-treating with anything I could find (not good).  Five years ago, I saw a Doctor and was prescribed every medicine on the market. The latest was Prilosec, which I have been taking for 2 years and was helping but the past year the dosages kept going up and the medicine no longer worked. I was literally drinking massive amounts of Maalox each day.  The chest pains, coughing, hoarseness and heartburn is not bad that I can't stand it.  I will be having reflux surgery on November 15th but my GI Doctor prescribed Dexilant and told me to give it a try. Dexilant is the miracle I was waiting for. It produced a bronchial cough but I was willing to put up with that. I still need surgery but highlyrecommend Dexilant.",barb369
11,Dexilant,Erosive Esophagitis,8.0,,"September 12, 2011",33,Dexilant was prescribed to replace my previous combination of omeprazole and rantidine. After 60 days is seems to be providing better GERD relief.,Anonymous

14,Dexilant,Erosive Esophagitis,10.0,,"August 22, 2010",77,Was given a sample and within two days symptoms cleared up.  Insurance denied giving me full prescription so had to go with Protonix.  Within 3 days of taking the Protonix all symptoms returned.  Don't know what the difference is but the Dexilant works.,Anonymous
