0,Omeprazole,Erosive Esophagitis,5,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"August 8, 2021",4,"After taking this medication on & off for 4 & a half years (but more recently on a higher dose) it had given me pain in the kidney so I decided to lower it again & stop it all together. After only 4 days off it, I realise the depression I have been experiencing in the last few months could possibly have been the omeprazole as well. I am starting to feel like my old self again. I would rather try a bland diet & drink just water than go back on this medication. Iâ€™ll see how that goes!",Tjay
1,Omeprazole,Erosive Esophagitis,10,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"July 20, 2021",0,This medication always stops my GERD in one day or less. 40MG/day is a bit much but use it for at least one month+ to get the most benefit from it. I've switched to Protonix and I will use this up before I stop the meds all together. The doctors have you on omeprazole for a month then see you in their office and prescribe one more month after the GERD comes back. I buy OTC Nexium and double it up to 40mg/day if 20mg/day doesn't work. But don't take it for ever. Stop using it to see if the GERD has gone away. You don't want esophageal cancer is why you take for more than two weeks (as recommended on the OTC bottle).,Gerdy Gerdy Man
2,Omeprazole,Erosive Esophagitis,10,Taken for 5 to 10 years,"August 29, 2020",26,Sorry to read how this drug omeprazole has cause many people on here problems. My nickname for this is my wonder drug. Had reflux problems most of my adult life. Got to the stage food was getting stuck in my esophagus. It was a miserable time ending up with me being hospitalised. Got diagnosed with eosinophilic esophagitis and a hiatus hernia . Scarring on my esophagus from the acid reflux  caused narrowing. Was put on this omeprazole. A week in to it was eating normally. Had a procedure to fix the narrowing. Was told I'd have to be on this drug 20mg daily for life. Long term it may give side effects that I've yet to experience but what ever they are I'm still grateful I can now eat and drink what I enjoy again. Good luck to all.,Ardesal
3,Omeprazole,Erosive Esophagitis,10,Taken for 10 years or more,"November 24, 2016",23,"I had food stuck in my esophagus and it was very painful.  The gastroenterologist did the procedure to stretch the opening and that has to be done again every 2 - 8 years.  Then she placed me on one 40 mg of omeprazole capsule every morning. It works like a charm. Then I will suddenly lose the ability to swallow smoothly again.  I will go have the procedure again.  Then the omeprazole will work again very well until I do something stupid with my diet. I mess myself up with my diet or try to eat too fast.  As long as I am careful about the method of which I chew my food and swallow it safely and not in such a dumb rush, I do okay.  And the omeprazole works plus doesn't cause any side effects.  Mornings B4 U eat is best but don't miss a dose.",Southerngirl2
4,Omeprazole,Erosive Esophagitis,8,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"November 2, 2016",18,With having discomfort for years after i had been to the doctors  and they weren't quite sure what was wrong with me and diagnosed me with ibs. After years of not getting better they decided to do a endoscopy and it showed I had esophagitis.  They started me of on 20mg for 2 weeks then increased to 40mg I must say I had no side effects and not one bellyache or chest pain or heartburn since I am overall happy with this drug.,Rattlebox84
5,Omeprazole,Erosive Esophagitis,7,,"September 26, 2015",27,I was getting food stuck n my throat ended up n the hospital they put a balloon down n my chest stretched it open a little & put me on 40 omeprazole it really helps with no side affects that I can tell but if I go over 4 or 5 days without taking it I'll get choked on food but I read u should only take this med for 14 days @ a time.  I have taken 1 for 2 years every morning if I miss for a few days I start getting choked on food again should I keep on taking it? I guess either that or choke to death,calvanator
6,Omeprazole,Erosive Esophagitis,10,,"July 9, 2014",55,Prilosec (omeprazole):I have taken Prilosec or omeprazole for years and in increasing doses over time it has given me perfect control over my reflux and heart burn problem. Nexium made me so sick after 5 days of use that I could not get out of bed. Nothing else has ever worked so extremely well than this medicine.,hannahleila
7,Omeprazole,Erosive Esophagitis,10,,"November 5, 2011",18,I found this medicine very helpful. Took away the discomfort I had in my stomach and chest area. The only negative I had was a dry mouth and a few mild headaches.,Anonymous
8,Omeprazole,Erosive Esophagitis,8,,"April 21, 2011",46,Prilosec (omeprazole):Got control of the condition with Prevacid 30mg for a few months (felt sick most of the time on it) and then switched to Prilosec OTC after a mild relapse. I loved this medication and it worked like a charm for quite a few years. (3-4) Then gradually it became less effective and I had to go from 10 mg to 20 mg. Overall I am pleased with the product.,Anonymous
