1,Pantoprazole,Erosive Esophagitis,,Taken for less than 1 month,"January 26, 2022",2,"After an endoscopy revealed mild erosive esophagitis I was prescribed this pill I was told it was silent reflux. My only symptoms was severe GI gas and bloat I have been on it 2 weeks today I was taking 40 mg once a day every morning before meals. This only made my condition much worse, originallt I had bloat and dry mouth and this medication made it worse. I'm giving up my coffee and making sure I don't eat foods that will cause the esophagitis. This medication only made my bloat worse with bad back pain and constipation since I'm only on it 2 weeks. I'm taking it every other day for a few days and coming off of it. I am going to try natural ways to help. I believe my problem is from my hernia. I will make sure to eat small meals and replace my morning cup of coffee with chamomile tea. I'm sorry for the people who have had side effects as I have when you take a medication and the side effects are not worth it especially it made the existing gas and bloating worse and caused constipation. What do I do?",Anonymous

The taste in my mouth is driving me crazy. I am extremely concerned this drug gave me GERD and I have no idea what to do. I have talked to three doctors and none of them know how to help me. They all deny the drug can do this, but what else could have caused it? I have been anxious and depressed and terrified this drug did permanent damage to me.",Jordan
