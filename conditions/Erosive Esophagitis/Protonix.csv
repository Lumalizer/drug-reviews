1,Protonix,Erosive Esophagitis,9,,"October 7, 2016",33,"this is literally my 2nd day on protonix, and I am very happy. I will say I have experienced dizziness for about the first 2/3 minutes upon taking. I can deal with that; I am not experiencing acid reflux!!!! I have literally taken Prilosec for 6 years. I had the gastric sleeve which brings upon extreme heartburn",Tracnicky

4,Protonix,Erosive Esophagitis,9,,"March 31, 2008",115,"Started off with the ""Purple Pill"" effective but very expensive. Physician switched me to ""Pantoprazole"" (Protonix) - just as effective, a fraction of the price. My diet slipped back to pre-med carelessness (spicy food, garlic, onions, curries &c and STILL no problems. I did go back to sensible eating at the urging of my daughter!",Releived
