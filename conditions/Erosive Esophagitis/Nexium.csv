0,Nexium,Erosive Esophagitis,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"March 12, 2021",3,"WORST MEDICINE EVER!! I took this for gastritis for 6 days as prescribed by my medical specialist and only felt worse. I had a very mild discomfort in my upper abdomen before and after taking it, I felt as if my entire abdomen was tight and knotted and in pain. But the WORST part of it was that it made me feel DEPRESSED and had really dark suicidal thoughts and that feeling I can never forget. It scared me to the core. And then I realised it was this medicine that made me so mentally upset as well as physically in pain. I would not recommend this to anyone. Please use something else but not this.",Shocked
1,Nexium,Erosive Esophagitis,2.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"October 15, 2020",6,"I was given Nexium 40mg two years ago after a diagnosis of a mild esophagitis. Since then I've been taking it on and off when symptoms return (mainly at the turn of the season). Sure it does help with the acid, but at what price!! I'm just 27 and have always been a sporty guy, but since taking the drug I have developed a chronic back pain, shoulder pain and various tendinitis that are taking ages to heal. I don't know if the PPI has caused all these issues or if it the gastritis, but after doing some research I believe there is a connection with the drug. In addition I'm getting constantly sick (flue, sore throat, cold) like my immune system has gone crazy...",Mister F

6,Nexium,Erosive Esophagitis,9.0,,"August 7, 2015",26,"I was on Aciphex for 4-5 yrs. but the expense of it shifted me over to Nexium. I have now been taking 20 mg. Nexium 4 yrs. & have not had a GERD attack in years. My concerns are now that you can buy it OTC, I am concerned it will not be strong enough? And secondly, why is it that most nutritionists & holistic doctors insist that these acid controlling pills are the worse thing to take for your body?  I tried not taking it for 2 mos. & immediately had an attack which is horrible. Can someone answer my concerns please.",BK
