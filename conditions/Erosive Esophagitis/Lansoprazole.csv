0,Lansoprazole,Erosive Esophagitis,8,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"September 2, 2021",0,It's kind of alright. It was more effective when I first started taking it. It still works alright for me throughout the day. I take it for acid reflux. Acid reflux goes away quicker if I lay down on my left side. It's not a huge problem. Just that it could affect me in public if it starts not working properly. I think I might need to start taking two though. As it isn't as effective on me as it used to be. Just glad I can still live my life without it affecting me.,Sarah
1,Lansoprazole,Erosive Esophagitis,3,Taken for 10 years or more,"February 9, 2021",2,"I’ve been on Pepcid for like 20 years. It has always worked perfectly for my severe acid reflux disease. However, recently the previous black/pink capsules have been changed to white/blue ones. Could care less about the color, but these do not work for me. A few times a week, I have to take over the counter acid reducers or take another lansoprazole.",A Marie

3,Lansoprazole,Erosive Esophagitis,4,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"December 18, 2018",5,"I have been taking Lansoprazole 30mg twice a day for a little over a year ago getting great relief for my erosive esphagitis and GERD. My pharmacists switched to this manufacturer and did not work as well as the other manufacturer. Therefore, I am taking this plus filling in with Pepcid at least once a day. Am now looking for another pharmacy so I can go back to the other manufacturer product. Very disappointing.",Granny

5,Lansoprazole,Erosive Esophagitis,9,,"February 19, 2018",12,Lansoprazole has eliminated pain from gastritis for 6 years.  Downsides are that I become anemic due to reduced ability to absorb B vitamins from food. Taking Sublingual B complex vitamins (1 mg X twice daily) has raised my energy level considerably.,Pablo525
