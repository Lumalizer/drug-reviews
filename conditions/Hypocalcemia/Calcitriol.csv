0,Calcitriol,Hypocalcemia,10,Taken for 10 years or more,"August 20, 2017",9,"Rocaltrol (calcitriol):I too take Rocaltrol, but the generic form which is Calcitriol.  I had thyroid cancer and my parathyroid was messed up during the removal of the thyroid.  Without this medication my body would go numb and I would have facial spasms.  I will have to take this medication the rest of my life, but I'm thankful I can get it and insurance does pay for it.",Spatter24
1,Calcitriol,Hypocalcemia,10,Taken for 10 years or more,"January 9, 2016",2,"Rocaltrol (calcitriol):As a result of thyroid/parathyroid cancer, I have a hypocalcaemic and hypoparathyroid condition. Therefore I must take rocaltrol to maintain adequate calcium levels and to lower TSH levels to prevent the return of cancer.  The supplier to my pharmacy no longer has any rocaltrol in stock , and I am in desperate need.  Can you help?","Shirley Hanshaw, 662-519-3416"
2,Calcitriol,Hypocalcemia,5,,"November 8, 2009",7,"I have also been on Calcitriol 0.5 mcg x 2 twice daily in addition to 5400 mg (total) calcium and 756 mg magnesium (total) daily.  Still experiencing sever symptoms of hypocalcemia - tingling, chills, muscle spasm, light headedness, etc.   Also, had papillary cancer with all thyroid removed - surgeon likely removed all parathyroids as 2 were found in pathology and no parathyroid hormone detected in subsequent lab tests.",Anonymous
3,Calcitriol,Hypocalcemia,6,,"November 3, 2009",9,"I have been taking Calcitriol for just about 2 months. After 1 month I felt great, my DR reduced my dosage from 0.50 to 0.25mcgs. About a week later I had slight symptoms and at 1 1/2 weeks I was headed to the ER taking 4500mg of calcium every 6 hours. Since increasing the dosage of Calcitriol back to 0.50mcgs I have noticed some of the symptoms and definitely their severity going away, but it has been a SLOW process. My condition was a result of complications from a Thyroidectomy due to Papillary Carcinoma (Cancer), in which I believe my Parathyroids (all) were put into shock and possibly destroyed.",hypocalcemia/hypoparathyroidism
