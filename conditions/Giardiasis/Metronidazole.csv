0,Metronidazole,Giardiasis,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"November 6, 2021",0,It didn't take long for me to figure out I had giardia.  Drank some sketchy looking water while on a hunting trip and just over a week later my dog started barking at my belly making noises.  Took forever and a day for tests to come back so I had to wait to start treatment.  I'm on day 2 and I feel fine and my bowels feel normal for the first time in a month.,Dave
1,Metronidazole,Giardiasis,8.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"November 2, 2021",0,"I was really scared to use this based on reviews but am experiencing very minor side effects. I’m taking 500 mg 3/day for 7 days for giardia. Side effects are very manageable and not severe at all: headache, fatigue, mild stomach upset. I take with food, wash the pill down with lemon flavored water (helps a lot with the taste) and drink lots of fluids throughout the day.  Side effects are nothing compared to the fatigue/stomach issues I have from giardia. Efficacy tbd.",Seventy Seven

Stool samples done nothing remarkable . Though I do believe it depends on the laboratory.Flagyl is my only relief . I want to take it for ever. No serious side effects . I had a gastroscope and biopsies taken, 4 days later felt like I was dying . Living on the toilet and a fever . Had to just about get on my knees for dr to give me Flagyl . It was magic so I’m trying to find out if I can take it permanently.",Squeakywheel

4,Metronidazole,Giardiasis,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"January 31, 2021",1,"I am a 19 year old female. I began taking this drug because I had a parasite that was causing me terrible symptoms. When I started metronidazole, the first 2 days I slept for a total of 36 of 48 hours. Then every morning I began feeling so nauseous and vomit. This happened like clockwork every morning at around 5:45am. It made me not feel like myself anymore. I couldn't finish the last 2 doses because of the severity of the side effects. And even worse, to top it all off, it did not get rid of my parasite. So now I am trying new antibiotics, hoping they won't make me as sick. Metronidazole is the WORST medication I have ever taken, if there is another option for you, take it.",Cfowler
5,Metronidazole,Giardiasis,6.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"November 14, 2020",0,"I got giardia from my cat, who was diagnosed with it a few days after bringing him home.I have now completed this metronidazole prescription. I took it 2x daily for 7 days, and do not feel much better.It got much worse the first half of the week, and now it is better in terms of nausea and cramping. Still having excessive diarrhea. I guess it’s time to go back to my doctor and see what my options are.Moral of the story: if you get this med it’s gonna suck real bad for a while, but it at least gets somewhat better.",Marie
6,Metronidazole,Giardiasis,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"September 25, 2020",5,Caught Giardia traveling. Had severe stomach cramps and raging diarrhea for 5 days. Flagyl quickly cured my symptoms. Took 500mg (I weigh 110lbs) 2 times daily. Would recommend this drug. Only side effect was a metallic taste on day 4. Took meds with food.,Al
7,Metronidazole,Giardiasis,4.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"July 24, 2020",4,"Caught giardia from our new kitten that was spreading her feces everywhere. Vet lab confirmed she had it, so my case is so far presumptive. Socialized health care in Canada means I won't get the actual results of my stool sample for up to 5 days. I'm on day 4 of 7 of metronidazole(500 mg x2 / day) of metronidazole and feeling a little better I suppose... definitely got worse before getting better. Still, I'm having mental fog, no energy and tired, headaches, very nauseous, and depressed. Still having diarrhea, but it's not explosive like when my symptoms started. It's an awful drug. I really hope it's working.",Super Sayan
8,Metronidazole,Giardiasis,9.0,,"June 29, 2020",14,"Took Flagyl for 7 days because the doctor said I had a parasite in my stomach after taking a stool test.Read the reviews and freaked out about having horrible symptoms.The only symptoms I’ve experienced while taking it was some abdominal pain and change in urine colour. Other than that, It didn’t feel like I was taking a new medication.Pros: I felt better after the medication. So I noticed that I have less trapped gas, bloating, stomach noises when laying down.Cons: Remembering to take 3 pills a day with meals. So taking the pill every 8 hours. It’s important to take probiotics everyday! Some doctors fail to mention that.AND to take the medicine after EATING FOOD. DON'T TAKE IT ON AN EMPTY STOMACH- doctor told me this.",Lilly123
9,Metronidazole,Giardiasis,1.0,,"June 15, 2020",4,metronidazole  has not worked for me and I’ve taken two courses of it. I’ve had Giardiasis now for three months and cannot shift it.,Tiger

They did the test, blood, crypto and Guardia. This is the second time, same hospital.Looks like I am going back to get the right treatment.I'm sick and tired of being sick!!Thanks Dr",Slippers

13,Metronidazole,Giardiasis,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"May 20, 2019",4,"For me metronidazole is simply does not work  for the treatment of Giardia. I was prescribed 400mg x 3 per day for 5 days. The drug also has some nasty side effects, tight achilles heels, mental confusion and I was off balance whilst walking.",Russell
14,Metronidazole,Giardiasis,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"December 5, 2018",6,Flagyl (metronidazole):After 2 weeks of severe diarrhea just surviving on electrolyte drinks doctors were suggesting surgery. Flagyl was suggested by an experienced traveller a total of two 400mg tablets taken 4 hours apart completely cleared it up. That was 25 years ago. Since found it useful for acid reflux. It is a strong drug so  still use after other options have been excluded.,Steve
15,Metronidazole,Giardiasis,9.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"September 4, 2018",5,"I am in the middle of a 5 day, 3x250 mg treatment for giardiasis. I don't know yet if I have got rid of the bugs for good, but metronidazole has been a life saver for me so far as my stomach cramps used to keep me awake at night. I also want to thank my doctor for listening to me and having me tested for parasites even though she did not think that it would be useful! I did have a headache on the first  day, and I still feel the metallic taste in my mouth, but I will take that any day compared to what I was going through before taking the medication (I am taking a relatively low dosage though which may explain why the side effects are mild).",Lizzie
16,Metronidazole,Giardiasis,,,"August 12, 2018",1,"Got a stomach bug and my dr prescribed me this Flagyl. 500mg 3 times a day for 7 days. My experience so far is a lot of nausea but no vomiting. Headaches come and go. I have lost weight , urine is a weird color  stomach pain and had diarrhea.  Pretty much all the side effects. Lucky me!  Just stopped taking the pills yesterday and hope these symptoms go away.",Global
17,Metronidazole,Giardiasis,2.0,,"July 12, 2018",11,"I'm taking 5 400mg Flagyl tablets daily with a meal and I feel worse now than I did with Giardia. I've lost my appetite entirely, I've been stuck in bed for a week and now off work. I had been going to work with the Giardia because I thought it was IBS. But since I have been taking this poison (and it does feel exactly like I'm being poisoned), I barely get out of bed I am so fatigued. I am finding it hard to concentrate, my mouth tastes like I have been chewing on aluminum foil. I feel nauseous constantly, constipated and no matter how much water I drink I feel dehydrated. My urine is a dark colour with a strange smell.I have read this drug is an antagonist of vitamin B1 so I will start taking B1 and Magnesium supplements to hopefully improve these horrible side effects. Good luck to anyone reading this. The only reason I have given it a GENEROUS two stars because so far it has worked to reduce my giardia symptoms but once I finish this course, I will NEVER touch this stuff again.",Blu
18,Metronidazole,Giardiasis,9.0,,"September 18, 2017",18,"I've had this for 4 years.  I've seen many doctors and have lived very miserably and confused.  My mother ignored me and kept calling me a hypochondriac but I wanted answers.  Last week they figured it out.  I'm on 500mg Metronidazole 2x daily for 7 days.  Today is the 7th day.  I have never in my life been so terrified of being unhealthy forever.  I want to heal.  On Tuesday, they will be testing my stool to see if I have rid myself of this infection.  If I do not get rid of this stupid bug, I will be soo disappointed.  And the metronidazole feels highly toxic.  My tongue is yellow from all of the yeast in my body from my gut flora being annihilated.  Someone comfort me. ",parkersean75yahoo.com
19,Metronidazole,Giardiasis,9.0,,"August 28, 2017",12,"I was on 250 mg 3X a day for one week to treat a giardia infection I have likely had for years without detection.  My doctor will also have me on a three-day course in about two weeks, in keeping with the cyst cycles.  I just finished the course and had no adverse side effects.  I took them in the middle of fairly-sized meals and made sure to drink at least a gallon of water a day, along with eating a clean diet.  Perhaps it was the lower dose or one of those measures, but I did not even feel fatigued during the course of my medication. Know that not everyone has terrible (or any) side effects. I delayed taking these after reading so many accounts of awful experiences, but I imagine there are plenty of others that have no side effects.",MadrigalsMom
20,Metronidazole,Giardiasis,6.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"August 27, 2017",6,"Was prescribed 500mg three times a day for  7 days for parasite. On the 7th day I started feeling better and my stools were returning to normal. For 3 days after the end of treatment I felt soooo good, I thought I was cured... only to be sick again on day 4 after treatment. Maybe I need a longer treatment or another antibiotic. However I saw a difference after taking it. In my case the side effect were awful tast in the mouth and dark urine, but nothing is comparable to the symptoms of this evil parasite that I am dealing with since 2 years thinking I had IBS ...",Mtlguy

23,Metronidazole,Giardiasis,5.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"October 14, 2016",0,"I had a hysterectomy and was given a large stress dose of steroids as well as iv antibiotics during my hospital stay.  These are both contributors to yeast overgrowth, as I later found out.  It manifested everywhere... the folds of my skin, vagina, and mouth, that were confirmed.  My doctor prescribed 500 MG 2x daily for 10 days.  During treatment, I had a bad taste in my mouth, coated tongue, smelly gas,  and stinky, white-ish soft stools that sunk immediately and didn't float.  I've been done with it for about a week, and the side effects did not seem to improve, but have only gotten worse.

After the first day of taking these I woke up at 2 am and vomited a total of 6 times before the gravol finally kicked in. Been taking gravol along with my meds ever since. Also been experiencing brain fog (possibly due to gravol), severe fatigue (gravol again?) and loss of appetite. You absolutely must eat food before taking these, especially if you are prone to nausea like me. Won't know if the med even works until I do a stool test after the 10 days.",Tintan123456789012

Being treated for a parasite that was making me feel awful but not this awful! I know in the long run this will be beneficial as the parasite will be gone however, taking for ten days is exhausting.

Well Flagyl is also prescribed for this as well as Giardia...so I'm taking 500mg / 3 times a day for 10 days. I luckily haven't had to take any medicine for years and I have to say, this stuff reaally sucks. If you are feeling crappy while on this you are not the only one. I'm now on the 7th day and really looking forward to being done. Feeling like I can't function / think straight / general listlessness and anxiety like others say is my experience.

The Flagyl has a terrible taste and you have to drink something besides water while you are taking it because everything tastes metallic.  It works to eradicate the infection but I was very happy when the seven days of treatment was over.  I also experienced lack of appetite however you must eat something when you take Flagyl or it will upset your stomach. Other side effects experienced: bloating, burping, hiccups, terrible taste in my mouth all the time, lack of energy. But the need for the medication outweighs the side effects and it took care of the infection.",Anonymous NY
