0,Tranexamic acid,Bleeding Disorder,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"February 22, 2022",0,"We are done having kids. Over 9 years, I have tried several different IUDs and pills, but results were unsatisfactory overall. I came off the pill and took the Depo Provera shot one week ago. My primary goal was to reduce period bleeding and I was prepared to wait through spotting. However, Depo didn't work for me. I experienced VERY HEAVY BLEEDING with clots. I was prescribed tranexamic acid which has reduced the bleeding on day 1. I plan to take 2 pills daily for 8 days , and hopefully the bleeding will stop. Otherwise, I'll keep using tranex to manage symptoms till my 3 months on Depo expire.I will not be taking another Depo shot. I'm happy to manage my periods with tranexamic acid alone. I didn't try tranex acid while on the pill as I was advised of risk of increased clots. I'm so greatful to God for the invention of tranexamic acid and expect to live my life freely from here on now using it. I also considered ablation or a hysterectomy but decided neither was worth the risk!",Christie O

4,Tranexamic acid,Bleeding Disorder,9.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"November 24, 2020",1,I was prescribed this for unexplained and excessive vaginal bleeding. I found that it worked. I stopped taking it however because the pharmacist said it caused irreversible hair loss? I'm not sure if this is true as I googled it today and I do not see where it says that it causes that.,Weenie roast

6,Tranexamic acid,Bleeding Disorder,9.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"August 11, 2020",4,"I have HHT, as do my siblings.  They were told about tranexamic acid during their last visit to an HHT Treatment Center, began taking it, then told me about their positive results.  So I asked by PCP to Rx it, and started taking it.  This medication made a difference after just 3-4 days. Now, a few months later, my nosebleeds are  infrequent and much less severe.  They have become quite easy to manage compared to what they were previously, when I would be standing over the sink pouring/dripping blood for long periods of time.  The only side effect I have noticed is thickening of oral secretions, which is no big deal...manageable by drinking lots of water to stay well-hydrated, and frequent oral hygiene using mouthwash.",Sissy
7,Tranexamic acid,Bleeding Disorder,,,"December 2, 2019",11,"I had an episode of severe gushing bleeding so bad that I have to change super max pad in 30mins and my knicker sand pyjama every time. I was diagnosed with fibroid few months  ago. I was then taken in an ambulance as I was hypotensive and severely anemic. In hospital they transfused me with blood and gave me tranexamic acid IV. As soon as I had the injection I had the worst side effects - chest pain, heaviness in chest (gabrahat), Unusual pain, right leg calf muscle cramping, nausea and vomiting, cough, stuffy nose. I told my doctor and I stopped taking it. The medication surely lightens the bleeding but the side effects where equally bad for me.",Ten

11,Tranexamic acid,Bleeding Disorder,,,"April 26, 2018",8,"I will be turning 50 yrs soon and I have had constant bleeding/spotting for the past 5 yrs. I have had untold tests, seen about 3 Drs in my surgery and NO one can tell me why I'm bleeding/spotting so often. Out of a month I'm lucky if i had 5 days of feeling normal. I cannot wear Tampax so living in pads every day is driving me mad, bordering depression now. Two days ago I went back to the surgery saw a Dr I saw 4 yrs ago and now he has referred me to have more tests done with the possibility of having a hysterectomy, he prescribed these tablets and I have been taking them for two days now and no change. I don't know how long I can take them. I'm so frustrated with this bleeding it's affecting all aspects of my life, I feel like I'm the only woman in the world that is experiencing this! I even had the Mirena coil put in nearly a year ago and that was a waste of time. Hope this tablet will help but I'm not holding my breath.",Rudegirl

15,Tranexamic acid,Bleeding Disorder,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"July 5, 2017",3,"I went to my doctor with excessive blood loss that started lasting up to 8 days with loss of massive clots. I was told due to having issues for years that my husband & I would never naturally have children. I have had CIN3, ovarian cysts, endometriosis & now fibroids. My periods were coming on time every 4 weeks, it was just the flow that was all different & extreme. I had the Mirena Implant put in & now I bleed for 12 days every 2 weeks & am more irritable & moody than ever. Doctor put me on Tranexamic Acid tablets & Ponstan & now I am experiencing dizziness, confusion & a feeling like I'm walking on air. Totally wrong response we were all looking for. This was meant to stop me bleed & not have all the issues I have right now.",Halli
16,Tranexamic acid,Bleeding Disorder,8.0,,"February 22, 2017",19,"When I was 13 my periods started to go mental, they would occur every 2 weeks and last for a week and they were so heavy I'd bleed through a deluxe night pad in an hour. I would spend school days in with the nurse either because I'd be in agony or I had just fainted. I wouldn't be able to sleep either as I'd constantly had to change my pad. My Mam eventually brought me to the doctor and because I was so young they didn't want to put me on the pill so instead she prescribed Cyklokapron . At first I had to take two 500mg tablets four times a day now I'm down to twice a day and it's great. My periods are still heavy but manageable, I'm no longer severely anemic I only get week long periods once a month. My periods no longer ruin my life.",Orla32
17,Tranexamic acid,Bleeding Disorder,10.0,,"January 25, 2017",28,"I've had horrible periods since high school. I remember in high school when the bell rang I just sat there until the entire class left then walked to the office to get a ride home. When I got up, it was a puddle of blood. Literally a puddle.  I'm 35 and would sleep with a towel under me plus an overnight pad because I would always overflow. I've started getting really bad clots and I am unable to take birth control pills. Bad bruises, weak, anemic.. You know the drill.  So doctor suggested this... I'm on day 3 and it is a total game changer. I did a spin class this morning (usually day 2 of HEAVY flow) with a tampon and panty liner. I never ever thought this was possible. Small headache, totally worth it.",Lindsay2014

21,Tranexamic acid,Bleeding Disorder,,,"June 5, 2015",110,"I must say that after 1 year of extremely heavy periods, I honestly didn't think that taking these pills would help. I was using about 70  pads per cycle.  Today is my 2nd day and the bleeding has slowed down by at least 75%.  I don't usually comment, but I figured I should just in case someone is looking for some relief.  I feel so much better already.  Hope and pray it continues..",gina618
