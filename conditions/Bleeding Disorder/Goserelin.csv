0,Goserelin,Bleeding Disorder,10.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"December 27, 2021",0,Zoladex (goserelin):I’m 2.5 months into Zoladex treatment. Was extremely nervous at first but have been pleasantly surprised. Side effects only started 4th week into treatment. Hot flashes are not as bad as I thought they’d be. Headaches are probably my worst symptom - nothing a Paracetamol can’t help though.No period has been life changing. I have had a great improvement in my mental health too.,Harriet
1,Goserelin,Bleeding Disorder,9.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"December 4, 2021",2,"Zoladex (goserelin):I have just had my third Zoladex injection and my treatment plan is to have twelve with a review at six months. After struggling with very heavy periods for the last eight years, caused by huge fibroids, this medication was suggested to bring on early menopause. I’m 53 so had been hoping for the last few years that things would ‘sort themselves out’ but clearly that wasn’t to be.The upsides are, my periods stopped immediately and the injections are simple and really nothing to worry about. This should also mean that I do not have to have  any sort of surgery.The downsides for me have been the hot flashes both day and night, and for the first couple of months interrupted sleep although this does seem to be getting better now. Also headaches, usually in the first few days after the injection and some nausea.I guess it’s a trade off you have to make to work out which gives you the best quality of life. Remember some people don’t get any side effects at all.",Kathy

3,Goserelin,Bleeding Disorder,10.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"August 12, 2021",3,"Zoladex (goserelin):I had a very positive experience using Zoladex. I was very frightened of having the injections after reading the reviews and almost didn’t take the medication. But I was told that it was required before surgery for a hysterectomy (due to fibroids) in order to minimise blood loss. I had two doses and both injections were fine. The nurses knew what they were doing and were quick at doing it. No side effects for me. My periods stopped after first dose. Great! By the time of surgery my fibroids had shrunk! Surgery went well. Everyone’s experience with this medication will be different. Do your research, know the pros and cons. Be aware of these bad experiences but don’t let them put you off. I was happy and the medication really helped me with my condition. Wishing you all the best.",Lamberta
4,Goserelin,Bleeding Disorder,7.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"April 23, 2021",1,"Zoladex (goserelin):Years of heaving bleeding.  It got to the point of me collapsing in a pool of blood and being rushed into hospital a few times on blood transfusions.  Fibroids were the cause . I started on Zoladex August 2020  only 1 positive is  no bleeding .  I can go on forever the list of negatives . Depression, looking 9 months pregnant for the last 9 months even though I'm not . Hot sweats that are  so bad at night that I sleep with a fan on full and cut off my long hair to cope. I have itchy  lumpy  skin all over .  Feeling tired, no infection exhausted,   due my 10th zoladex and still waiting for a full hysterectomy. Apparently the list is long I'm on category 2  which is urgent. I can't see an end to this nightmare.  I am hoping for surgery soon  and get my  slim body back  and live life again.",Joy
5,Goserelin,Bleeding Disorder,6.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"January 23, 2021",2,"Zoladex (goserelin):I’m 38 and have a 13yr old but was planning on having more kids. All was normal till I hit my 30s when my heavy bleeding started then I notified my Gp. I was prescribed iron tablets and tranexamic acid to control my bleeding. A year or so later, I was diagnosed with multiple fibroids leading to severely anemic, cramping, my 5 day cycle now lasting 7 days or more, clotting. With the tranexamic acid not helping at all, I had to drop it. My partner and I have been trying to conceive for the last 6 yrs to no avail. I’ve had a couple unsuccessful fibroid resection surgeries. My Gynae has started me on Zoladex 3.6 to help shrink the fibroid in preparation for my Myomectomy. Had my 4th injection 2 days ago, the hot flashes are a pain in the butt but feels good to be free of my cycle for now. My anxiety has calm down. Hopefully I’m not on Zoladex for long as it’s not advisable with fibroids for more than 3 months??? My gynae advises longer but I'm skeptical about this. Just want this over with",Berley
6,Goserelin,Bleeding Disorder,8.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"July 28, 2019",4,"Zoladex (goserelin):The Zoladex injection has been my only saviour. I am now 24, I was put on the drug to initially ‘reset’ my reproductive system to see if it could stop my excessive unexplained bleeding but once coming off zoladex last year for 6 months the same pattern emerged. I have now had over 20 Zoladex injections with the intention of continuing this until I have children. I have been lucky in the sense that I have regained my life in being able to participate in normal experiences without the worrying of bleeding everywhere. I’ve experienced some of the side effects including hot flushes, weight gain, headaches and bone pain which comes and then goes just as quickly (besides the weight sadly). Depression is definitely something I have mildly developed since being on the drug but the continuous bleeding was leading me down that path anyway!",K
7,Goserelin,Bleeding Disorder,1.0,,"September 21, 2018",6,"Zoladex (goserelin):I’m 40 and have no children, I was suffering abnormal bleeding due to fibroids but no pain. I was loosing so much blood, I had been rushed into hospital on several occasions. The bleeding caused me to suffer severe anaemia. I was really happy when zoladex  was suggested as it meant I didn’t have to have a hysterectomy, unfortunately my experience was not good. I had my first injection and about 2 weeks in I was having cluster headaches, depression, my whole body ached, I was getting confused, the hot sweats were unbearable, I put nearly 2 stone on and I was an emotional wreck, I still had the second injection and was taking HRT to help but the zolidex was taking over. The gynaecologist had then told me not to have the 3rd, my last one was 7 weeks ago but I’m feeling so much better all ready. I would never have zoladex again I’m booked in for a hysterectomy now and can’t wait for it all to be over so I can get back to being myself. I would never take zoladex again",Jane
8,Goserelin,Bleeding Disorder,10.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"March 16, 2018",0,"I took Zoladex 10.8mg In June 2017 because of my Fibroids.The side effects were horrible; hot flashes, sweating, irritability, however it increased my libido and gave me bigger boobs. 3 months later in September I had a hystericopic resection and I have never felt better. Actually I haven’t been to hospital even for the flu since, yet previously I used to be in hospital for anaemia, flu etc.My periods on the other hand went missing; this is the 9th month, so alerted my gynae about it.It was a good sacrifice to make however those 3 months  on zoladex were really tough for me.",Dinah
9,Goserelin,Bleeding Disorder,10.0,,"March 5, 2017",6,"Zoladex (goserelin):Stopped periods as expected great news no more heavy bleeding stopped chronic pain that dropped me to my knees when standing or moving Downsides are memory loss, chronic fatigue, bone pain, loss of hair, sore breasts I'm on zoladex 3.6 once a month with HRT injection number 4 Overall I'm in less pain but still struggling with every day tasks and to carry on working as a normal healthy 36 year old woman should be able to roll on coming off this drug and having my hysterectomy",Molster
