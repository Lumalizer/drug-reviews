0,Lactulose,Constipation Acute,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"November 16, 2021",4,"This worked well for me and relatively quickly too. I took my first dose at 2pm and by 10pm I was all cleared out and more comfortable than I had been for days, The process was comparatively painless though not without its frustrations; literally hours of sitting on a toilet while a very slow but unstoppable molten flow issued from me! Other than a bit of a crampy and gurgly tummy, I suffered no side effects either - before this, I had tried Laxido and Dulcosoft, both of which made me vomit within an hour of taking and gave me acute abdominal cramps.  The taste of lactulose is much more palatable as well - it is very sweet, though could be diluted in juice or water if this bothers you.",Eclair
1,Lactulose,Constipation Acute,10.0,,"October 10, 2021",3,"I suffer from endometriosis and for the past 5 years, I've been prescribed codeine on and off when I have my flare ups which are roughly only 4-6 times a year. I'd always been prescribed laxatives that weren't very helpful with my constipation - they either took too long to work and I'd be in pain for a few days or they didn't soften the stool enough so when I did finally pass a motion, it would be extremely painful. I discovered lactulose 5 months ago when my mum bought me some from a pharmacy and IT HAS BEEN A LIFESAVER! I only take it when I haven't passed a motion in a few days and every other home remedy I do (kiwifruit and prune juice, increased water, exercise) hasn't helped. It works within 1-2 hours AND it softens the stool enough so that I feel like I'm passing a normal motion and it's virtually painless. I highly recommend this! It's the best laxatives I've ever come across and I've had my fair share of trials of different laxatives in the last 5 years.",Ayla
2,Lactulose,Constipation Acute,3.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"October 4, 2021",0,"I had been in hospitals and I was able to go, but never much. Imaging showed a moderate amount of stool in me. The doctor ordered lactulose. The nurse said it would just make it easier for me to go. It was in a cup that looked like an oversized coffee creamer. I took it. Right before I went to OT. Less than an hour after and I started cramping. Before I could finish saying I needed to get to a bathroom, I was going. They took me to my room and I got on the bedside commode. I wasn’t able to get off of it for 1.5 hours. I always thought magnesium citrate was awful stuff. This was way more harsh for me. It was effective, but I was not expecting that much of an effect or for it to hit so soon. I would be afraid to take it again.",Indigo
3,Lactulose,Constipation Acute,9.0,,"June 12, 2021",10,"4 days of suffering, nothing was coming out of me despite 30 times of trying, also had lot of pain at kidneys. I had all the Fibre foods, drank gallons of water but nothing!!  One of my friends suggested Loose syrup which I drank 40ml. Finally I felt some pressure,  took my chance but the size of the tool was so wide that my body was under sized. What came next is graphic but I literally had no choice. I had to manually clear some  of the hard stool out of butt.  Passage still felt super small for the huge train but I had to push it so hard, it felt like I was giving birth  as it exited me. What followed the impact stool was runnier and everything was just free flowing. This is super painful experience and I  now understand what others go thru. If my experience could be of any help, the medicine is for sure effective but took 8+ hours to show results with lot of my own efforts to make it work",Lucky888
4,Lactulose,Constipation Acute,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"May 10, 2021",5,"After a week on codeine I hadn’t gone to the toilet properly, tried this before contacting my gp, took the max dose and within 2 hours it had worked and cleared me out, only downside is I can’t trust a fart!!! It said it would take up to 48hrs to work but didn’t expect it to work as quick, feel much better and less bloated",Emilina
5,Lactulose,Constipation Acute,8.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"March 22, 2021",2,"FLATULENCE!So chronic you’d almost be proud of it. Don’t have visitors over or even use this on a day when you have an empty house. I use it when I maybe drift away from my usual diet and need help, so maybe once/twice a month I take 60ml in one go. Your poo basically ends up as liquid by the end of the experience. I used to use it everyday for a while, but found I was both bloated and flatulent.",Nikie
6,Lactulose,Constipation Acute,,,"December 24, 2020",83,"Wow! I took 60 mLs of lactulose and OH WOW, two hours later my farts became atomic. They kept coming, one after another - shooting out like a machine gun. Once I raced to the toilet it was as if a hydrogen bomb had gone off. The back splash was a deluge, almost a tidal wave. It was mind altering.",Albert
7,Lactulose,Constipation Acute,7.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"December 9, 2020",4,"Take 45ml in one go, usually use this for one major blowout as opposed to the 15ml twice a day slow burner. Require constant toilet access for about 4 hours after. Toilet is pebble-dashed after, so being alone in the house while this is going on is best. Hate the consistency .",Nikki
8,Lactulose,Constipation Acute,8.0,,"November 3, 2020",4,"My constipation I can manage with my diet when I’m at home and have a regular routine, but when my routine is out of synch on holiday then it becomes a real issue. when I come back from holiday I will take 50ML in one go. It tastes vile, goosebumps as it’s going down. Maybe the thought of what’s ahead makes it taste worse than it actually is. After that , in about maybe 2 hours I’ll have a movement. After that, I usually have chronic and very smelly gas. As a result I never do this when there’s anyone in the house. Literally I do this at 9am when my husband is gone to work. When he gets back by 6 the gas has usually subsided and I can close all the windows again!! Between gas there are trips to the bathroom, which become less and less solid until finally it’s just all brown water. My advice is, this is excellent for a one off where you have a day where you don’t need to be at work or anywhere else to be.",Lollipop
9,Lactulose,Constipation Acute,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"September 26, 2020",17,"Duphalac (lactulose):The WORST medication I have ever taken. Not only does it NOT work, it makes everything 10x worse. Painful gas and flatulence at an unpreced level. Took it to deal with constipation post surgery and it made the surgery pain so much worse. Useless!",Patient

11,Lactulose,Constipation Acute,8.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"June 2, 2020",17,"Try different ways of taking this medicine lactulose. For me, taking it the way the label said just didn’t do anything. It caused major and very embarrassing gas. Honestly don’t leave the house the day you begin this dosing. What I found was it hindered my sleep because of the gas, a lot of tummy rumbling, luckily was sleeping alone that night. Don’t underestimate the frequency of the gas either, constant. I think try out different ways.I take 1 entire capful, and that usually does the trick. Just don’t make any plans for that day.",Lillylilo1
12,Lactulose,Constipation Acute,7.0,,"May 29, 2020",13,"I started to take this the way it says on the label, 15ML twice a day. It did nothing for me other than cause terrible, vile flatulence. The smell was like a sewer, and zero relief. Annoyed after about 3 days, I decided to take more. So I took 60ML in one. Within 2 hours, I had had a bowel movement. In the end all that came out was liquid. There seemed to be less flatulence also. I find it’s sort of unpredictable when you take it day and night, you may or may not have a movement the next day. Or you might, and it might not be satisfactory (could be very small, still feel like you need to go after) which is very almost upsetting really when you know what it’s like to suffer so much from constipation. The flatulence ends if you take it for a few days it’s as though ur body needs time to get used to it. If you’re going to use this, use it on a day when you don’t need to be anywhere or meet anyone! Take the 60ML and take it with a warm drink to help it along.",Axaandiemaya
13,Lactulose,Constipation Acute,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"April 21, 2020",21,"So... I have having trouble passing through a bowel motion as  currently there is a tear. Anyway. I would hurt when I was trying. So I was quite scared to go to the toilet knowing it was going to hurt. My partner has lactose which was for himself Previously. So I took the recommendation dose.. a couple hours passed and I was delayed they fact I needed to go to the loo. So I took another dose.. OMG... DO NOT TAKE ANOTHER DOSE 2 HOURS AFTER.. I was farting. Burping. Farting. Left right and centre. Stinking the place out. I was ready to go to bed when the trapped wind came along. So I ran to the toilet and that’s when  all-hell broke loose.. OMG. I’ve never been that bad ever. It’s really gross and I wouldn’t want anyone to go through that. My partner came through to see if I was ok and funny enough he’s making a joke out of it but trust me DO NOT TAKE MORE IN 2 HOURS, you’re toilet will hate you.. I’m ok now it does it’s job if that’s what you were looking for",OmgGirl
14,Lactulose,Constipation Acute,2.0,,"February 6, 2020",9,"I was prescribed lactulose for constant bloating and constipation but the taste is disgusting and taste so overly SWEET! ( like drinking syrup ) but apart from that I find that it doesn't works as well at all, unlike the sodium picosulphate it works instantly after 7hrs. This laxative isn't as effective at all apart from it causes excessive WIND and they smell so bad to the point it's too disgusting to bare. Plus I can't tell when it's a fart or a poo neither it's scary to expel it incase I poo myself :/ TMI I know but it's TRUE! I don't think it's as good for constipation but good for wind but it also has not helped with bloating as I still wake up bloated and have it all day and night :(",Joesyjo28
15,Lactulose,Constipation Acute,7.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"January 22, 2020",13,"I occasionally use this lactulose for severe constipation most often caused by drugs. I don't find it works straight away. I have lymphocytic colitis and ibsd so my gut is very sensitive.  Yes, lactulose is effective but very quickly the frequent farts become smellly and toxic. I stay away from people  because of it. Over a few days farts start to expel little bits of poo and I soil my pants. I become too frightened to fart when out. I also can't tell the difference between a fart or a poo so I have to go to the loo every time just incase. Bit of a nuisance when it turns out to be just a fart. For those without lymphocytic colitis and ibsd  its probably fine. Don't be put off by my experience.",Stevens

18,Lactulose,Constipation Acute,10.0,,"August 1, 2019",38,"I am a middle-aged woman. I’ve had constipation issues since I can remember. I’ve become used to going twice a week. But chemo for cancer treatment recently put me over the one-week mark and I was in agony when prescribed stool softeners and every other OTC thing I threw at it did nothing. This drug lactulose worked. Took a 15ml dose (3 tsp with a nice little syringe measure that came with) then repeated two hours later with a big drink of water and bowels moved several times shortly after second dose. It made my stomach rumble and gave me diarrhea, but it was worth it. (Stay home and close to a toilet.) I Dialled back the dose and then stopped altogether for now but it was the kickstart I needed. It’s a relief to know it’s in the arsenal. It is kind of thick and very sweet, but that was not a dealbreaker for me. (May be mixed into food or drink, but I just quickly drank it straight.) Highly recommend for those struggling.",Baldie

Each time I go to the toilet the fissure can reopen and the healing process has to start again. Taking lactose has soften my stool so giving my anal fissure time to heal.

23,Lactulose,Constipation Acute,7.0,,"December 5, 2017",16,"This worked after 48 hours.  The label said that it could take up to 48 hours, but most of the other reviews said that it worked much faster, so when it didn't work quickly for me, I began to lose hope.  Thankfully, it worked, pretty much exactly after 48 hours.  I'm in my second trimester, and hadn't  done a poo for 4 days, and the last time had been very painful.  I'd felt incredibly bloated and uncomfortable, and hunched over when I walked, and couldn't get comfortable to sleep.  When I first went again after 48 hours, it wasn't easy, but it wasn't really painful either.  I stirred the medicine into large glasses of water to help me drink enough fluids, and also to dilute the excessively sweet taste.",VerstopfteVerlobte

Before the lactulose I tried all the over the counter pills, psylium husk, fleet enemas, suppositories, magnesium citrate etc for 2 weeks.  It's now approaching 3 weeks and still nothing.
