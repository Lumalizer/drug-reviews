0,Keytruda,Endometrial Cancer,2,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"March 18, 2022",0,"I took Keytruda for endometrial cancer. After the second dose, I was diagnosed with type 1 diabetes. This a somewhat rare, but well known side effect of Keytruda. There are several documented cases of this drug causing type 1 diabetes.  I know this drug can save or extend lives, just realize it can also change your life forever, in a not so positive way.  Good luck!",Eve
1,Keytruda,Endometrial Cancer,10,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"December 6, 2020",10,I was diagnosed with fourth stage endometrial cancer in November 2017. Chemotherapy did not work and the mass tumor continued to grow. My oncologist was able to get Keytruda approval for my tumor even though it had never been Approved for my type of tumor. My Keytruda treatment started January 2018 and has reduced my tumor by over 50%. I have had no symptoms of any issues with taking Keytruda. It will be three years in February with no side effects whatsoever. My last PT scan two months it’s showing that the tumor is still slightly reducing. I am extremely happy because they didn’t think I would even come close to living this long. I am 83 years old and I’m doing really well.,Pickleshhs
2,Keytruda,Endometrial Cancer,5,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"October 1, 2020",13,"I have now been on Keytruda almost 1 year. Stage 3 uterine cancer diagnosed in 2018, spent 1 year on chemo/radiation. Cancer came back 4 months later, was put on Keytruda. My body is a mess. Great fatigue, rash, intestinal issues, lack of strength, etc. I feel mostly terrible almost every day. I work too, out of circumstance not because I want to. I don't want to continue on this drug. I feel my quality of life has diminished greatly on this drug. I love my oncologist, but she keeps trying to tell me most of the side effects I have aren't from Keytruda. ALL of the health issues I have are listed as side effects. My doctor wants me on this for 2 years total. There is no way. My body is so out of whack I just hope it won't stay that way when I'm off Keytruda, which I think is going to be now. For me, I was miserable taking this as I experienced almost every side effect. I hope some of you do better than I did.",Koala
