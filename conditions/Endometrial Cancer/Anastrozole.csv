0,Anastrozole,Endometrial Cancer,1,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"September 14, 2019",21,"Started this anastrozole 4 months ago and I have never been more miserable. Have endometrial cancer and had had a complicated hysterectomy and after one month started the drug. After one month started having severe insomnia so that I was only getting 3 hours of sleep per night. My hands and feet felt like they were on fire. My arms and shoulders felt weak. I was tripping over my own feet. I had knee pain, shin pain so bad that I couldn't get up my condo steps. That is when I quit. I have been off for 2 weeks. The burning is mostly gone. My knees still hurt, especially after exercise. My arms still feel weak and my chest hurts. I hope all of this resolves with time. I am (was) a very active 57 yo. I am not going on any more drugs until I see if things are resolving.",Painball
1,Anastrozole,Endometrial Cancer,5,,"July 25, 2016",17,"After surgery for ovarian cancer I was treated for 6 months with chemo which ended in Jan '13. After having to go back for another course of chemo my blood tests went up and they started me on Anastrozole. Have been on it for 6 months so far. Had stomach problems and constipation for a while, but as each problem came up I found something that would help. Other side effects have been stiffness in my joints-ankles and hips, short term memory loss, as well as trying to come up with a word I wanted to use and couldn't recall it. Loss of balance another issue as well",Trish7665
2,Anastrozole,Endometrial Cancer,9,,"March 28, 2016",26,I have been on this for 9 months now for stage 4 endometrial carcinoma grade 1. I do get the joint pain which is worse on getting up in the morning etc but once I'm mobile it eases. I can put up with this as it is keeping the cancer at bay at the moment and me alive. Nearly 1 year in remission.,Maz67
3,Anastrozole,Endometrial Cancer,9,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"October 2, 2013",36,"I've been on Arimidex for about 10 months now for endometroid type, estrogen and progesterone sensitive, endometrial cancer, stage 2, grade 3, greater than 50% myometrial invasion.   also had internal rads (brachytherapy), but chose to forgo the chemo and external rads.  I'm one year out from surgery, and to date, no evidence of disease.  I eat healthy, have lost a lot of weight, and do a lot of exercise -- especially running, since running helps strengthen your bones.  I'm not sure how the Arimidex might have affected my bone density over this last year, because I was never given a bone density test.  I also take a calcium-magnesium-vitamin D-vitamin K-boron supplement to help strengthen my bones.",HappyHen
4,Anastrozole,Endometrial Cancer,8,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"August 28, 2012",45,"Arimidex (anastrozole):Endometrial stromal sarcoma: I've been on this medicine since hysterectomy/pathology report in March, about five months.  Too soon to tell if it is working but so far so good.  The side effects are as stated by many already...increased joint pain and stiffness everywhere and especially hands and feet, increased weight, minor and occasional dizziness, increased feeling of tiredness.  I'm going to request a bone density scan to monitor risk of osteoporosis.  It is all tolerable so far, but I hope it doesn't get worse and I hope none of it is permanent. ",Better than cancer
