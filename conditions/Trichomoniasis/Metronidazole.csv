0,Metronidazole,Trichomoniasis,1.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"March 26, 2022",0,"I was prescribed Flagyl for an intestinal infection and I have never been so ill in all my life. I was so out of control with dizziness, fatigue, sickness and terrible pulsating headaches. I would try and get out of bed and the room would be spinning and I would suffer palpitations. Walking to the next room was a mammoth task. I could not physically function for a week and then started to get very high blood pressure. Do not take this medication. It has terrible side effects.",Vera
1,Metronidazole,Trichomoniasis,6.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"February 22, 2022",0,So weird with this med. Found out I had Trich after I had itching and thought I had a yeast infection. I’m taking 500mg 2x a day for 7 days. I felt symptoms got better but now on day 7 I had 1 pill left. I took it and now I feel itching again!! It’s awful. Going to see my doctor tomorrow and hope it didn’t come back. This truly sucks.,Anonymous
2,Metronidazole,Trichomoniasis,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"January 11, 2022",0,"500mg 2x daily for 7 days. The pills were white, capsule shaped & a bit large. Extremely bitter tasting. I would take them w/bread & butter, chew up a small amount of food a bit til slimy, spit it into my hand, push the pill into the food ball, then pop it in my mouth & gulp it down w/water. I have a strong aversion to taking pills, though. As far as side effects, I’m in good health with very little sensitivities. The effects I experienced: slight nausea on day one and a metallic taste upon waking, some excess gas/bloating throughout the course of medicine.  I continued working throughout the treatment, did not drink any alcohol at all. I’m relieved to report the symptoms are gone - goodbye disgusting fish smell!The pill tastes awful & is annoying, but stick with it - it will work. If you’re taking this for BV or trich, be sure to clean & sanitize all clothing, bedding, towels, adult toys, etc. and communicate honestly w/ur partner(s). Good luck!",hopeful.heart
3,Metronidazole,Trichomoniasis,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"January 9, 2022",0,"I just finished my two per 7 day round of 500mg metronidazole pills. I’ve taken it before years ago and the taste hasn’t improved, let me tell you.But I managed to finish the week with minor side effects ~ mostly a bit of nausea the first 24hrs & excess gas/bloating the rest of the time. I would wake up with a metallic taste in my mouth, as well. I absolutely cannot swallow larger pills and found that it’s easier to chew a mouthful of food, spit it out into my hand, place the pill facing the back of my throat into the ball of food, then toss it back with a gulp of water. I swear by a smaller bite of buttered toast or roll. I am cured and much better now that I’m done with the treatment. No itching, no more disgusting fishy smell. Remember to wash all underwear, toys, etc. Get your partner tested so you don’t get reinfected. And practice consciously safe sex with honest communication w/all your partners. This medication is NOT pleasant but it definitely works! Good luck!",hopeful.heart
4,Metronidazole,Trichomoniasis,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"November 2, 2021",0,"Flagyl (metronidazole):I was so scared to take this medication due to reading the reviews. I took four 500 mg pills (2000 mg). I went and got the medication at 7:30pm and got home around 7:45pm. I ate pasta with a strawberry banana smoothie. I took the pills after eating at around 8pm. I put them in the back of my throat and swallowed them with my smoothie. I did taste a little bit of the pill, but it wasn’t that bad, and it didn’t stay in my mouth long. I have a prescription already for zofran, so I took a Zofran along with the medication (pharmacist said it was okay). I then made me a cup of lemon ginger tea just in case & didn’t end up drinking any of it. I waited for the side effects to hit & nothing really happened. I had a headache that lasted for about 20 minutes and went away. I went to bed at around 10:45pm, just because I was sleepy from a long day at work. If you don’t want to feel nauseous, I would recommend asking for Zofran to help! This experience went great!",brturner1

7,Metronidazole,Trichomoniasis,9.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"August 23, 2021",1,"Initially dealing with the shock of having to take it was a lot for me especially because I have intense health anxiety/fear of taking new medication. After reading the reviews on this site, it took me 7 days to work up the courage! I knew I had to take the meds and there was no way around it. I took the 4 pills, 500mg dose. All at once. I finally felt so relieved!! I used yogurt & put the pills 1 by 1 on a spoon w/ yogurt & then all the way back to my throat. Worked like a charm w/ 3 out of 4, tasting one a little because I didn’t do it right but that taste did not linger at all! As for side effects I did feel a bit nauseous & a tiny bit dizzy at first but I feel like antibiotics in general can make you feel this way. I was driving just fine! (Not saying drive but!) The hardest thing was that I slept very lightly the first night. No full blown insomnia though! I hope I can help someone who feels the way I did! Trust your doctor! (I know it’s hard)",Sarah
8,Metronidazole,Trichomoniasis,9.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"August 3, 2021",0,"I'm writing this for anyone that may be stressing out about taking this med. I found out I had trich, thanks to a cheating ex. Took me 4 months to get correctly diagnosed. I was prescribed 2 metronidazole in one dose. I was so sick from anxiety from reading the reviews that I put it off for a good week. BUT I had pretty much zero side effects at all! I made sure I had dinner, then 40 mins beforehand I took an anti nausea tablet. I coated each pill in some honey and had no taste at all- that everyone has mentioned. I went to bed and took a valium as I was so anxious and worked up about these meds! I woke up in morning with a headache but no nausea. The only effects I feel are tiredness, but that's it. It's now 24hrs since I took the mega dose and hoping that this cures it! So don't be afraid, I was certain I was going to have the worst side effects and I'm shocked at how normal I feel. Just do it ;)",Jennay
9,Metronidazole,Trichomoniasis,8.0,,"July 24, 2021",1,"I was informed I had trich earlier this month. I was treated with a one time dose of 4 metronidazole tablets. And told to refrain from sex for 7 days. Other than the taste being horrible I have no complaints or side effects. My symptoms cleared up 2 days. No watery discharge. No irritation. No burning. I was getting back to my old self and happy as anything ! But then, on the 6th day. I noticed some symptoms resurfacing. The irritation, burning, and discharge (but different texture). So call my OBGYN and I’m back in the stirrups 2 days later.  HOWEVER she informed me that I just most likely developed a yeast infection from the metronidazole. YES. Turns out that antibiotic can get rid of good bacteria in the vagina along with the trich parasite. So naturally I confused it for trich again ! She prescribed me fluconazole for the yeast infection and I’m waiting for it to clear up now! She also informed me she found no trich from the vaginal fluid during the exam. And my cervix looks healthy!",Wild Wendy
10,Metronidazole,Trichomoniasis,1.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"July 14, 2021",0,So I took the 4 pills for one dose it helped for about 4-5 days but I noticed I started getting the discharge once again so I contacted my doctor and she suggested taking another course of the 4 pills again so I did today. But honestly now that I’ve been observing it more I feel like after the treatment is over it recurs again. I’ve been like this for about a year and nothing is helping. I don’t know what else to do. On other hands medication isn’t that bad just a slight headache but they do have an awful taste.,Mary

Allergic to penicillin, so taking an antibiotic is so scary for me. I rolled the pills in a small piece of fruit roll up to cover the taste. Took it right after a meal and ate a few spoons of yogurt afterwards and drank water. No issues at all. Hopefully I never have to take it again but I wouldn’t hesitate If it was prescribed.",Bg

I’ve taken this antibiotic twice throughout my life and my body reacts poorly to it. I’ve been dealing with Trichomoniasis for almost 4 months now and I started off taking a dose of 4 pills in one night which didn’t clear any of my symptoms. That morning around 5am I started puking up blood and went to an urgent care in which they told me to never take that antibiotic again as it was tearing my stomach up. Please do not be scared of this post, my body has always reacted bad with metronidazole. I’ve tried countless antibiotics at this point to try and clear up the trich infection but nothings working.

18,Metronidazole,Trichomoniasis,8.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"March 18, 2021",91,I was diagnosed with Trich & BV. Had to take 500 mg of 4 pills at once. I was scared after reading reviews.

Woke up with the metallic taste in my mouth. But nothing that is too bad or I cant handle. But today I feel better already. Even got my energy back. This was a lesson learned to use protection or don't have sex. This was the consequence of my stupidity. I can't blame anybody but myself.,Barbie79

I started this and I think I might of messed up though because I drunk some wine a few nights which probably caused it to be less effective. I went to my physician to check on some other stuff weeks later and also gave her a dirty urine and trich came back positive I’m now taking the 7 day/2 times a day antibiotic by the grace of god I hope it works it is just really mind blowing to me because I am barely sexually active and this happens I feel so gross no matter how common they say this is it’s just upsetting.

Metronidazole gave me no side effects at all-BUT I  suggest taking them at least 4 hours apart. Yesterday I took them 3 hours apart & I don't know if it's cos of that or cos I only had 4 biscuits with the second tablet, but either way I ended up having terrible stomach cramps. I felt sick this morning too but I'm better now. So yeah, take them with a full meal at least 4 hours apart you should be fine. Drink lots of water with them. If you have the pills with a break line you can break them in half cos they are really big, but you get used to it TBH. They've definitely helped my problem!

So I went for my follow up a few weeks later and had another exam. I had trich and BV so I was prescribed the 4 pills of flagyl 500mg to take as one dosage, followed up by one dosage of diflucan 150 mg because I get yeast infections after taking antibiotics. I highly recommend taking the one dosage of four pills, instead of the seven or two days. I ate before taking the medicine, however later on in the day I felt nauseous. I had a metallic taste in my mouth even when trying to drink water, so I just slept it off. However, the next day I'm feeling great, no odor, no discharge, no nothing.

It's hard for me to swallow pills so I ended up crushing the other 3 and why did I do that... The taste is disgusting.. It's so horrible and it seems as if everything I drink or eat I can't get rid of the taste. Yuck!,Anonymous

What I do, is I take it with a huge glass of milk, fill your mouth up with milk, drop it in and swallow! Sometimes it works and you don't taste anything but milk, but sometimes it floats around and hits your tongue! Besides how bad it tastes, I get super dizzy after taking this pill, almost immediately I am dizzy and nauseous with a nasty headache! Of course it helps if you eat before hand, but the lightheaded, dizzy feeling isn't fun at all! Feels like I have my eyes crossed, it's painful.

Not only do I have a disgustingly, horrible taste in my mouth that nothing seems to get rid of, but I'm so nauseous that every time I have to take another one, I automatically throw up just from the thought. The directions say to eat before or take with food, but I can't keep anything down, not to mention I'm extremely thirsty, but when I try to drink anything (including water) its disgusting. Everything tastes like this pill. I feel like I have a fever although I've checked many times, and I don't, and I'm having horrible headaches. However all of my symptoms are gone thank God.

I didn't have any of the (I personally think exaggerated) side effects some of these other reviews listed. I even took it on a completely empty stomach at the end of the day.No problems with the taste either as I take them differently than most people.

Upon the first dose (500 mg) I suffered from flu like side effects. My neck grew stiff, I felt feverish and steadily nauseous. It did not cause me to lose my appetite, despite the nausea. Headaches became common, along with an undying thirst. Having to go to work on this medicine was as difficult as a virus. I had trouble sleeping to the extent that I actually had remained awake for over thirty hours before falling asleep. It was around the third day in that I suddenly had thick, white discharge that had a musty odor, however that only happened that one day. It is a rough pill, but it gets the job done.
