0,Flagyl,Trichomoniasis,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"November 2, 2021",0,"I was so scared to take this medication due to reading the reviews. I took four 500 mg pills (2000 mg). I went and got the medication at 7:30pm and got home around 7:45pm. I ate pasta with a strawberry banana smoothie. I took the pills after eating at around 8pm. I put them in the back of my throat and swallowed them with my smoothie. I did taste a little bit of the pill, but it wasn’t that bad, and it didn’t stay in my mouth long. I have a prescription already for zofran, so I took a Zofran along with the medication (pharmacist said it was okay). I then made me a cup of lemon ginger tea just in case & didn’t end up drinking any of it. I waited for the side effects to hit & nothing really happened. I had a headache that lasted for about 20 minutes and went away. I went to bed at around 10:45pm, just because I was sleepy from a long day at work. If you don’t want to feel nauseous, I would recommend asking for Zofran to help! This experience went great!",brturner1
1,Flagyl,Trichomoniasis,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"April 12, 2021",66,"Was prescribed Flagyl for trich. I was skeptical and scared after reading the reviews because everyone made this medication seem terrible. This is my second time taking it and have not have one symptom either time. The first time I was prescribed a one day dose of the four 500 mg pills. This time the 7 day dose. I’m on day 3 and feel better. The smell has gone away and so has the itch. I feel like a new woman. I would suggest taking this antibiotic on a full stomach or drink it with a glass of milk. I promise, it’s no where as bad as everyone makes it seem. My anxiety was through the roof after reading these reviews, but I womaned up and took it. Yes the taste is absolutely terrible so please don’t roll it around on your tongue. I hope this helps ease someone else’s anxiety.",Lala
2,Flagyl,Trichomoniasis,2.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"May 9, 2020",38,Omg reading all these comments scares me.. the doctor prescribed the 4 pills to take at once.. two days it was clearing up.. after my period came the  trich came back. I went to get retested and I'm now waiting for results but I already know I still have this infection.  This meds should work the first time . I guess it's not strong enough to kill the infection in one or even two doses.. I'm scared and I hope it goes away soon.,Love2
3,Flagyl,Trichomoniasis,7.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"April 3, 2020",20,I first got prescribed 4 Flagyl 500 mg pills to take at once for trichomoniasis. It took away the burning and itching and I seen a decrease in discharge. However; I still have burning when peeing. I now got prescribed a second dose of Flagyl but this time it’s a 7 day dosage of 500 mg pills twice a day. I Have taken 2 day’s of this new dosage and my discharge is even better but still burning when urinating. I am hoping this medicine cures the Trichomoniasis.,Adfnl
4,Flagyl,Trichomoniasis,,Taken for less than 1 month,"July 6, 2019",10,I have taken this med in 4 doses at once a few times and done it a different way every time. I ate more than normal and then took it with a phenergan because phenergan is for nausea and causes drowsiness. This is the only way if you are a drinker.,Na-Na
5,Flagyl,Trichomoniasis,8.0,,"March 14, 2017",4,"I read the directions wrong for flagyl, I took two 250mg a day instead of four a day . So now I would be taking the pills for about 10 -11 days if I start to take them 4 a day now like I was suppose to. But  I am not sure if it is that safe to take them for that long if I continue to take them  now at 4 a day But I do have a big event this weekend and alcohol is involved , and everyone will ask why I'm not drinking because I am the partier and drinker. Not sure what to do",Bbbxoxoxoxo
6,Flagyl,Trichomoniasis,8.0,,"November 8, 2016",18,"I was prescribed 500mg of flagyl 2x a day for 7 days to cure my trichomoniasis. I can't tell you how happy I was to have the week over with. It made me depressed, anxious, and I was on vacation, which meant no alcohol while abroad, as alcohol interacts with the medicine severely. I should mention that I had researched the ""no alcohol"" warning quite a bit before my trip; I'm also on an anti-depressant, which is also contraindicated with alcohol, but doesn't actually cause a reaction in my experience. It would appear that some people can tolerate modest consumption of alcohol while on flagyl while the large majority fall ill. I made the mistake of ordering a glass of wine. Huge mistake. HUGE. The sickness wasn't worth it. At least I'm cured",OooSicko
7,Flagyl,Trichomoniasis,2.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"November 1, 2016",19,I was giving four 500MG of Flagyl to take all at once. I took them this past Sunday. I have read a lot about how it tastes bad or is making people sick. I have not had any side affects. I know everyone's bodies react differently but just thought I would share how I took mine incase it helps someone else. I took mine first thing in the morning ate some breakfast took the pills (put them on the back of my tongue its the only way I can swallow any pill. May have helped not taste anything) drank some water and then continued to eat the rest of my breakfast. After that being said I must say that I still have some symptoms so it's left me wondering if these pills have had any affect at all on me but it might still be to early to tell.,Praying4relief
8,Flagyl,Trichomoniasis,1.0,,"July 29, 2016",43,"Was diagnosed with Trich.  Dr. prescribed four 500 mgs of Flagyl to take at once.  Only complaint was metallic taste but it made me drink water more often and chew minty gum - I survived.  Unfortunately, it did not work.  6 weeks and 2 days later the discharge, itching, symptoms returned.  Note: I had not been with intimate with anyone, so it was not because of sexual contact, Flagyl just didn't work.  Returned to dr., was re-tested and it was positive for Trich.  Dr. prescribed Tinidazole the second time which I took yesterday; as soon as I reach or exceed 60-90 days with no symptoms, I will repost.",ADG1961
9,Flagyl,Trichomoniasis,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"September 22, 2015",27,"Was put on Flagyl 500mg twice a day for one week. Tomorrow morning is my last pill. Had no clue about this antibiotic. 1st pill was taken on an empty stomach and I put the pill on the front of my tongue....big mistake!  Was very aware after that what I had to do...place pill as far back as you can and drink water, fruit punch as fast as you can, on a full stomach!  I constantly feel like I'm car sick, off and on headaches, some anxiety and just an overall disconnected feeling. But.....I have to admit it really works!",Popgrl12
10,Flagyl,Trichomoniasis,8.0,,"June 26, 2015",10,"This medicine works but, the taste is so bad the second day of being on it I started throwing up the sickness went away but, I'm still getting major headaches and I feel exhausted. I was percribed 30 of them for a colon infection due to not being able to go to the bathroom caused  the infection spread into my stomach.",amgel26
11,Flagyl,Trichomoniasis,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"December 2, 2013",56,"I started the medicine and didn't have any side effects for up to three days, but after the third day the side effects hit me big time.  I was sick to my stomach, and I had vomiting.  I didn't have a problem with the taste of the pill, I just threw it in the back of my throat and chugged some juice to make it go away really quickly.  My infection seems to have cleared up, after the first two days.  No discharge, or itching.  Haven't had intercourse yet to see if the discomfort was gone but will make another review when that happens.  Great medicine!",TayMade

13,Flagyl,Trichomoniasis,5.0,,"August 2, 2010",64,"The first time they gave me Flagyl in 4 pills to take all at the same time. It worked great and I cleared up. The second I was given the same 4 pill dosage and the symptoms cleared up for about a week until I got my period, then the discharge, smell and itching came back with a vengeance.  So back to the doctor I went and this time they gave me Tindamax.",Anonymous
