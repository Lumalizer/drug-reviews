2,Baclofen,Spinal Spasticity,1.0,,"April 8, 2020",7,With this medicine I'm not sure if I should even leave my thoughts on it here. But I'm going to anyway. Very weird feeling after my thread day. It very well could have been on my first time taking this medication. I'll never take anything like this again. Nervous system got out of control. When I was using my phone ,Lyle
3,Baclofen,Spinal Spasticity,9.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"February 18, 2020",16,"Lioresal (baclofen):It literally saved me from neck surgery. I have a disc protrusion, that bulges into my spine cord. Iâ€™ve started taking this drug and the bulge became smaller due to muscle relaxation. I can feel my fingers and have enough power in my arms again. One important thing is a withdrawal process. It takes several months to go down. Otherwise I get spasms.",Spine Dog

6,Baclofen,Spinal Spasticity,10.0,,"January 27, 2018",19,After fighting with doctors for over 20 years that the pain was real and not in my head! Baclofen was my life saver. I had been misdiagnosed so many times that you truly do have to know your body and its symptoms and I found a doctor who listened. This pill saved my life. Start very small dosage and increase as stated... No side effects. It gave me my life back!  My symptoms started to disappear on the first day on it...SYMPTOMS that have been going on for 20 years. Found my breathing shallow for first few days so scaled back dosage. Now on 20mgs - 3 times per day. Living again!,Anonymous
7,Baclofen,Spinal Spasticity,,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"July 14, 2017",17,I was put on this medication and have been on it for about two 1/2 years. Recently my moods switched on and off light a light. My temper was out of control. Someone looked at me and we had a problem. On average I had high anxiety going on. I put them down and will not go back. I was pushing away everyone.  I had ringing in the ears. Continuous sweating... STAY AWAY! Not good!,Team Louisiana
