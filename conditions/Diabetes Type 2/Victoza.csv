1,Victoza,Diabetes Type 2,1.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"November 29, 2021",0,Doesn’t work for weight loss nor diabetes.  You may lose a few in the beginning but wait for the pounds to come back.  I feel worse on it and would rather take absolutely nothing.,Kdignet
2,Victoza,Diabetes Type 2,2.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"October 31, 2021",0,"I have taken 1.2mg Victoza now about 2 years. I have gotten more chronically fatigues, no weight loss just weight gain, nausea. I DO NOT believe a word of this weight loss for this except that it  cut my appetite once in awhile and made me nauseous once in awhile (probably the only reason anyone is losing weight). Feel this is a falsehood of preaching weight loss in my opinion to sell this costly drug. It has helped my blood sugars a lot but on the downside taken away my motivation and made me gain more weight. Seriously considering getting back off of this.",Doony62
3,Victoza,Diabetes Type 2,1.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"October 25, 2021",0,"It was horrible, I had increasing abdominal pain and cramps with nausea.  Inflammation in all my joints to the point where I could not support my weight in my left leg.  Difficulty breathing where I had to sit up for an hour during the night until my breathing would clear up, I have had an increasing constant cough since the first dose.  A lot of the difficulties increased the longer I was on it.  I tried to tough it out as long as I could but when my legs began to give out from under me I stopped taking it.  It is the fourth day since my last dose and my joints feel normal and my appetite is back and the cramps are decreasing.  My breathing is slowly getting better and I had a little difficulty last night but it is improving.",Old Vet
4,Victoza,Diabetes Type 2,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"October 19, 2021",0,"I was started on this after discovering that my lab work showed I was pre diabetes. I am a 65 yr old female A1c was 6.2 fast glucose 130. I am overweight much of which came about over the last say 7 years when I became almost totally immobilized with degenerative joint disease. Meds helped immensely control pain. After only 2.2 wks on Victoza I can say I now I have lost lbs and started to gain more energy and eat much less. Prior to Victoza,I was hungry very soon after eating meals. I now eat much less with the Victoza slowing my digestion. I take 1.2 mg and have zero side effects. Also have positive  female family history of cardiac issues. So it 's a win win so far and hope to continue all positivity !!!!",moxejan56
5,Victoza,Diabetes Type 2,10.0,,"July 23, 2021",1,"Just restarted Victoza again-had to stop in 2018 due to cost. Things went bad for my blood-sugar from 2018-2020, & my Endo made me use Lantus, which did bring me down from a 12.4 a1c to a 7.5 over 90 days. Still high AM bloods tho. I was given the choice of Ozempic or Victoza, & I chose the one I already knew, since I had taken Victoza before. Well, WOW! I recall nausea/headaches from Victoza before, & I have the same this time, but if I keep my calories low (no appetite, anyway), AND take Victoza at dinner (5:30 pm), I only have to lie down for a bit to take that nausea edge off & then feel fine.  My average bloods for the week I've been taking Victoza are 118!  AM draws are well below 155 now! No diarrhea OR constipation. Not one thing works for all, but Victoza is a wonder drug for me. I've lost 5 lbs this first week.  Moving up to the 1.2 dose tomorrow! Just glad to have my bloods low, to have lost the urge to overeat, & to have no real debilitating side effects from Victoza!",AngelBlue

Over a year ago I was diagnosed with Stage 4 Chronic Kidney disease. My specialist diabetic doctor and specialist nurse decided to prescribe LIRAGLUTIDE which commenced on 20/05/2021 just about 7 weeks ago. I commenced on dosage 0.6mg increased to 1.2mg on 23/06/2021.The very dramatic control on my diabetes is remarkable, now having fasting bloods of 5 to 7, and evening testing also seeing reduced blood results. So the drug is doing it’s job.However at 104kg still no weight loss, I have reduced my food to less than 2000 calories and walk about 1.2 miles plus step ups daily. I would say I have 12/different diagnoses and am 75 with skeletal disorders in the pot! So I do what I can but desperate to lose weight.

For the next 36 hours I was violently ill. I’ve honestly never taken a prescription that made me so sick. Dizzy, headache, nausea. The urge to vomit was so strong even 30 hours later, I had to take deep breaths to keep from hurling. No thanks. I called the doctors office today and told them, no way.",Hrts419

12,Victoza,Diabetes Type 2,9.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"January 6, 2021",51,I did my research on this medication and to be honest I was kinda nervous to take it. My Dr prescribed me this cuz my blood sugars were so out of whack. Morning BS were running any where from 250-270. I started this medication 2 1/2 weeks ago. At first didn't really get any side effects just a little nauseous here and there. I started  out at 2 clicks and gradually made it up the 0.6. My BS morning reading is around 160 which I love didn't think this medicine would work so quickly. I've lost 6lbs already starting weight was 167. I do have more energy and don't feel so sluggish like I used to with the high BS all day long. It curbed my appetite I don't have no cravings for any sugar. Eat small portions cuz I get full so easily. I actually noticed food that is too greasy gets me nauseous or stomach ache. I want to continue to share my story as weeks or months go on :),NK

16,Victoza,Diabetes Type 2,9.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"September 28, 2020",23,Within 4 days on the 0.6 dose my fasting blood sugars came down to 114. I'm not hungry. Before I started Victoza I was taking 20 units of Lantus and 2000 mg of metformin a day plus eating a low carb diet. I am slightly dizzy and get mild eggy burps and have some bathroom issues along with mild nausea. I plan to titrate up to the 1.2 dose by one click a day to help offset the side effects. Sipping on diet ginger ale seems to help calm the queasy. I hope this medication continues to work for me without bad side effects because this is literally the first time in years that my blood sugar is in a normal range.,Melistar

I been basically doing a BRAT diet last few days cause everything that I get comes back up. In the mornings are the worst cause, my stomach is empty and all that's coming up is green liquid that's sour.  My muscles in my stomach hurts so bad and I'm just tired of pooping. I will call my doctor next week to look into a different option because this is just not for my body. Oh yeah my blood sugar readings are good and I've lost 13 pounds in 2 week.

I was prescribed Victoza because I was borderline diabetic and to help aid in weight loss. I have been taking this medicine since Late November, so far I have dropped 14 lbs. The side affects are not always so great. Although it suppress my appetite and I no longer get/feel hungry throughout the day I have become very gassy and the nausea's are non-stop! My stomach will cramp up every now and again and cause some diarrhea which then leads to migraines from dehydration. If you can handle these side affects then I believe it can be a great medication for both lowering sugar levels and weight loss,.",J

26,Victoza,Diabetes Type 2,1.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"January 8, 2020",24,"I had been on Byetta and Metformin for twelve years and had maintained an A1C in the mid 5 range.  I had suffered no Diabetic related complications.  My treatment was successful. Then, my insurance insisted I change to Victoza.  It did not work and I had severe headaches, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea.  The diarrhea was so severe I was constantly dehydrated and then my vision began to change.  My AIC jumped to the high 7's.  The drug was a disaster for me.  I had to move heaven and earth to get back to Byetta and my AIC is coming down but the Byetta doesn't seem to be as effective as it was prior to taking the Victoza.  I have to wonder if the Victoza has left some residual problems with the pancreas not responding as before.",BJ

I really do love it because my A1C is constantly around 6, I'm on 1.2 dose, and since I have lost approximately 45 lbs I am really happy about that.  My only issue is the cost when I'm in the donut hole it goes up by $119.  I'm sincerely considering changing this med to another more affordable one.  I just can't do insulin.  I'm in a pickle.

However, the side effects have been horrendous starting with diarrhea, proceeding into a migraine, and then unbearable nausea. Week one on 0.6 started this way, but had nearly resolved by day 7. When I upped my dose to 1.2, the symptoms started all over again, exact same pattern, only this time the nausea was extreme and led to vomiting on day 8. I’ve had to miss 4 days of work and would have missed more, but I work three 12 hour shifts a week. I finally went back to 0.6 on day 8. Feeling pretty defeated, feeling like I stuck with it, missed work, and suffered all the ill effects for nothing. I was seeing great results, fbgs ~116, even had a BG of 75, but that really didn’t count since it was when I couldn’t hold any food down. Postprandial bgs ~140. This was all without insulin. I do still take 1000mg metformin nightly, though.",RBee80

30,Victoza,Diabetes Type 2,9.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"October 20, 2019",26,"I’ve been on Victoza for 3 months. I had horrible reactions to Ozempic. I have a very overly sensitive stomach with other GI issues. Ozempic made me very sick and I read better reviews on Victoza. I have been on .6mg for over 3 months and if you are having issues with higher doses, I strongly encourage keeping at a low dose. It was extremely effective for me! I tried to increase to 1.2mg and after 5 days my body started feeling the same effects Ozempic did so I went back to 0.6mg. My A1c went from 7.2 to 6.1 in 3 months!! It also had the opposite effect of the 1.2mg which gave me severe diarrhea the 0.6mg actually gives me normal BMs since I already have an ongoing GI issue with diarrhea. I honestly love it! I was told doctors don’t prescribe .6mg because no clinical studies weren’t done on this dosage, but this seriously worked great in 3 months. I’m giving it a 9/10 because I still get annoying gas and painful stomach cramps now and again, which can be annoying.",Sirine
31,Victoza,Diabetes Type 2,8.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"October 11, 2019",24,"The first week was the worst, started at 0.6. The diarrhea was bad. Even worse the weird belching, the burps were gross. It was like my body was getting rid of actual dirt in it. By the time second week rolled around and I had to increase my dose to 1.2 most of the ""dirt"" was out of my system. The belching still continued and BMs were better. Lost 4lbs. I'm at 1.8 dose now. The adjustment seems to get smoother to the increases of doses.  I agree with the other comments that it's strange how I don't think about food or wanting to eat. I'm hoping that prolonged thinking (or lack of thinking) will help change my relationship with food. Plus, I feel better on the inside, physically. If that makes any sense.Hoping for more and continued positive changes. I'm glad I stuck with it through the onset reactions.",Cajan

33,Victoza,Diabetes Type 2,5.0,,"October 3, 2019",14,"I'm giving this drug a solid 5 because it's really terrible yet really good. It has THE WORST side effects of anything ever. It has caused some of the worst pain of my life. Mainly I get very severe stomach cramps, nausea, and diarrhea.The other side of this drug is that it's excellent at controlling blood sugar. I take insulin and metformin also, and I don't think they are greatly effective on me. Victoza makes them work.One other benefit is appetite suppression, physically and mentally (if that's a thing). I actually went on this drug first for weight loss. It makes it so that I don't think about food at all. I don't get as hungry either. This naturally helps to lose weight.Those two things are good enough benefits for me to endure the absolutely horrific side effects.

I was started on the 0.6 dose for the first week alongside my 4x per day insulin  regime. The all day sickness feeling was hard to get used to and the very weird spontaneous burps! Almost immediately it started to reduce my blood glucose levels but I think that was mainly due to the fact that food was the last thing on my mind, whilst feeling so sick. The week was rounded off with horrendous D&V. I persevered and am now on the 1.2 injection. The bubbly tummy isn’t the nicest feeling but I’ve completely changed my whole eating regime. So I’m juggling insulin levels and food and bloods which is not easy.

I stopped the injections on a Thursday, and by Saturday I started having a fever and stopped urinating. I still also felt fatigue and nausea. It is Monday and I’m starting to feel better.

97,Victoza,Diabetes Type 2,3.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"March 25, 2018",9,I started victoza one month ago to bring my A1c and blood sugar levels down for my type 2 diabetes. In the beginning I started the low dose of 0.6 and then went up to 1.6. My physician advised me to stay on the 1.6 because my blood sugar levels started to become normal when I checked my sugars twice a day. So far the time I've taken victoza I noticed I felt severely dizzy and light headed. I called emergency ambulance and they checked my sugar and blood pressure. My blood pressure was extremely low 98/52 because of the victoza. I explained all this to my physician and agreed that victoza was the cause of my low blood pressure. I had to stop victoza. I don't recommend victoza for those who already have low blood pressure or normal blood pressure because your blood pressure can become too low on victoza. Talk to your doctor about all side effects before starting victoza to eliminate the risks rather than benefits.,Eboney
98,Victoza,Diabetes Type 2,8.0,,"March 17, 2018",11,"Hi so this review is based on my dad’s experience with Victoza. Definitely a drug that takes adjusting to. My dad’s A1C was at a level where we feared for his life, levels around 15-19 and he would not tell us but I knew he was not doing well and took him to a specialist. Dr suggested Victoza and we started adjusting it as directed. By the time he got at 1.8 the symptoms were unbearable. Sick, nausea no appetite. We decided to bring it down to 1.2.  He was still feeling slight discomfort and I told him to take it right before bed. This change has made his quality of life 100% better! He’s so happy and feeling better than he has in years! He’s only been on it for 2 months and A1C is down around 6-7. We are afraid of the long term side effects and will ask Dr since this drug is supposed to help your body promote insulin, first, can he lower it even more and how long is he expected to be on this drug. So far great experience but we are proceeding with caution and testing regular.",Daddy’s Girl

It takes  about a week to get use to each level. I think lowering blood sugar may be as responsible for feeling bad as medicine. When I started the first time blood glucose went from 200 to 80 in the morning. Too fast to lower it.

First off, the propylene glycol guy - unless your antifreeze is junk it should contain ethylene glycol. Additionally, almost all multi dose vials contain propylene glycol as a preservative and phenol is only a drying alcohol. It's also found in camphor phenique and similar oral pain remedies. It doesn't cause cancer it causes low blood pressure (pg) when given IV press in a fast manner. (Read a book).

When I was pregnant I had gestational diabetes and was on a special diet the whole time,  and it helped keep my blood sugars down. Now three years later I am having a problem again. I have a fertility issue that my sugars are naturally high, but thought I had it under control. After a week or so of not feeling good and taking my sugar and it was up to 250 I got a little scared and went to the Doctors. He put me on Victoza and since than I have more energy and have lost 5 pounds in the first week. I take it at night and have had no problems. I would definitely recommend this to anyone that can handle giving themselves the shot.",danisnip

Went out to eat with the family, fixed my usual ""first"" plate and wasn't able to even finish it. Normally I would of gone for a second plate too.

Thus far, I have had no nausea and I have dropped a few pounds already, which keeps me motivated to keep doing what I'm doing. I'm not happy to be on ""shots"" but it could be a whole lot worse!

My only main side effect so far has been the headaches.  I love the fact that I only have to take this once a day.
