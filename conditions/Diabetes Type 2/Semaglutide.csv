1,Semaglutide,Diabetes Type 2,6.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"March 30, 2022",0,Ozempic (semaglutide):I have been on Ozempic since the middle of October 2022. My A1C was 14 + when I first started this journey by the end of November my A1C was 7.2. I thought that this was a miracle drug. December 17th I woke up with severe pain in my left thigh swelling and sensitivity to touch. I thought it was my knee saw surgeon said no and sent me to the back surgeon they said no. After multiple trips to the ER no one could figure out what was wrong with me. I eventually went to a pain management doctor. He sent me to the neurologist who did a nerve study test. And finally diagnosed me a little over a week ago with diabetic amyotrophy- treatment related illness. This is the worst pain of my life. I've had the chest pain and stomach pain the severe pain at night I called them night terror pain because they are so severe that I would wish to die. I am told 1% of diabetics are diagnosed with this disease . It is due to Rapid decline in A1C. I do not know how I got to be a part of the lucky 1%.,Anonymous

I've lost about 8 lbs, but I attribute that to the nausea and not the meds doing anything special.

3,Semaglutide,Diabetes Type 2,6.0,,"March 27, 2022",0,Ozempic (semaglutide):Disappointed for several reasons. The effectiveness was minimal. I always had leftover that I was told I had to waste. I used it for about 8 months. The cost was quite high even with insurance. Ranged between $795 - $3000 but the company offered a savings card that would lower the cost. It started with great savings $25 my cost but each refill the savings card offered less and less savings. I finally refused to refill when they asked me to pay $800 for refill of 3 months.,Becca

I'm extremely sensitive to medications so thankfully it hasn't been too severe. At .25 I had nausea off and on for a couple of days and got sick if I over ate. You fill up so quickly so you have to eat slowly to keep from accidentally overeating. By the end of the 1st month I couldn't tell I was taking it. I just started the 0.5 dose and it's a little intense. I'm having to eat even slower. The 2nd day after the injection I was so sick from having a snack after having my tiny lunch. It was 4 hours after I ate my lunch so I'm assuming it was still sitting in my stomach. My few bites of a snack sent me over the edge into misery. I take an antidepressant and I believe it's behind my original weight gain. I feel it numbs the ability to feel full. I still have a small appetite on Ozempic but I dare not eat. My appetite has been greatly reduced but it's still there. So far 13 pounds are gone in 5 weeks.",Anonymous

6,Semaglutide,Diabetes Type 2,1.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"March 26, 2022",2,Ozempic (semaglutide):I haven't read all of the comments but my experience is very different. Since starting on Ozempic I have had the typical side effects mentioned (nausea/constipation) but the most upsetting thing is that I have GAINED almost 20 pounds. I keep taking the medication because the constipation side effect helps me with a gut issue that I've had for years. I wish I would have lost weight and not gained. I've been taking it for 6 months and if my weight keeps going up I will have to stop taking it.,Anonymous

My blood sugar levels kept crashing. Rushed to the ER, I had xray, every lab work/panel you can think of, CT scan - nothing. Ozempic is the only culprit.  I am texting this review from my hospital bed. I was admitted and put on fluids and liquid diet.

I suffered through 5 weeks of nausea, but my doctor gave me anti-nausea meds to get through it.  My A1C has stabilized at 5.1, I’ve gotten rid of Metformin, and lost 60 pounds.  If I eat too much, or eat unhealthy foods, I will still get sick.  My weight loss has tapered off, and the negative long term side effect I’ve had is that meat no longer tastes good.  I’ve transitioned to a mostly vegetarian diet.  Occasionally I’ll have a favorite meat meal, but it just doesn’t taste as good, and is liable to make me feel sick afterwards.  I’m fine with this trade off.",Mimi

I have insulin resistance, and my doctor wanted to bring my A1C down below 6. First, it caused me to GAIN 10 lbs while I was on the 3mg. I thought once I started the 7mg, the weight would finally start to come off. Nope.If that wasn't bad enough, I was lucky enough to experience one of the rare side effects...nerve damage.  My left leg started feeling like I had sciatica. It got a lot worse from there. Nerve damage not only affects the damaged area but your brain as well. It took about 4 months before I began to feel normal.  I had quit the Rybelsius as soon as I realized what was happening to me. My annual family vacation was ruined. I had an extra 10 lbs on me. I couldn't drive for a couple of months, and my brain was seriously affected. Oh yeah, and nerve damage is like pain I never felt before, and I've given birth twice.I'm glad for the folks helped by this. It sure didn't work out for me.",Carnation 4000

It went from a high of 6.8 to 5.7 in a couple of months.  My glucose number was 83.  First time it was under 100 on my blood test.  Although I did experience some nausea at first, that seemed to go away.  I always try to eat something 30 to 45 minutes after taking my dose in the morning.

My body does seem to be getting used to it.  I'm willing to work with it as long term benefits for me outweigh the short term discomfort.

18,Semaglutide,Diabetes Type 2,8.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"March 3, 2022",1,"Ozempic (semaglutide):My doctor recommended Ozempic for my type 2 diabetes. She said it had several benefits over my Metformin,  Glimepiride. I read the reviews and was TERRIFIED to try it. I eventually did and have had no side effects. I have been on it now for 5 weeks. I was started off on .25 and just took my first .5 dose. This is typical of how you start on the medicine. What I learned is that if you are going to go on it, you cannot expect to eat poorly (heavy meals, sugar etc) That is the only time I feel yucky on it. My blood sugars quickly went down and I feel much better. I averaged 145 after a meal, and now it is averaging about 110. I have already been taken off my Glimepiride and the goal is to go off Metformin as well. I have not had a new A1C yet but with my daily numbers, I am confident it will be low. I think those that experienced bad side effects may not have changed their eating habits and instead want the medicine to do all the work. Just my opinion. I am glad I started it.",Itzslp

I could barely eat for two months. Gas, bloating, side pain, back pain, stomatitis pain, non-stop burping, constipation, nausea, vomiting off and on. My food perpetually felt like it was backed up into my mouth. They had to take me off of the drug and now my sugars are higher than ever and no one can help me. They were ok before, but now doctors consider me as failing two types of drug classes because of this, won't give me my old meds back, and I may have to go on insulin.

I’ll first say, I’m horrified of needles. However, you can’t feel the needle at all, the medication going in sort of burns a bit, but that’s it! I’ve been on Ozempic for 5 months. I started at 254 lbs and started taking 0.25mg for 6 weeks. No side effects in the slightest. I also didn’t lose much either though because it is your body getting used to the medication rather than fixing your blood sugars. I then moved up to 0.5 and started seeing results with my weight and still no bad side effects other than eating less. I recently moved up to 1mg and am now down a total of 45 pounds in 5 months. Still no bad side effects. Eating has to be much more mechanical though because my hunger cues aren’t as strong, but no nausea. I would highly recommend this drug!

I am type 2 diabetic since 2005 and have been taking Metformin and injecting insulin (60 units per day). I was 115 kg when I commenced Ozempic. Prescribed for glucose control (which wasn't real bad at 7.1) but to help weight loss and blood pressure.  I started at 0.25g then 0.5 after four weeks then to 1.0g in week nine. I am already down 6 kg to 109 and blood pressure easing gradually.  I have also reduced my insulin from 60 units to 20 units per day.Side effects have been very mild, some slight constipation immediately after each dose and feeling a little nauseous after eating although smaller portions have helped a lot. Also I eat a couple of small bits of ginger after meals and that is great to stop the nausea feeling.  Ozempic certainly curbs the need for food, particularly fatty or sugary foods.Overall I am very happy so far.",Robert

I'm hoping that the nausea I do get helps instil better long-term eating habits.  I've also experienced appetite suppression, which has helped me prioritize proteins and vegetables.  I did get alternating bouts of constipation and diarrhea when starting this medicine, and am expecting that I'll experience the same with the dose increase.I have felt far more energy and my cravings for junk food have drastically reduced.

I have 4 autoimmune diseases and this was the sickest I have ever felt in my life. I almost went to the ER and if not for Covid I would have. It felt like someone had been feeding me rat poison.  Its the worst feeling ever. I truly don't know how this drug was approved by the FDA . I plan to take myself off it . Weight loss and blood sugar needs to be done in a healthier manner.

But this time it was a much stronger sensation, until the point that I projectile vomited about 5 times.  After that was over, I felt better - UNTIL about 5 hours later, when the process repeated itself.  I think it was likely due to the fact that I had some pizza and a cherry coke that day, which was a stupid thing for me to do.

Month 2 & 3, Uncomfortable. Stomach cramps, gas, and diarrhea probably for 4 days after injection. This can be really embarrassing in a small office. By the end of Month 3, I was feeling quite a bit better. At this point my hba1c was down for 5.2 from 9.4, I had virtually no diabetic symptoms. No blurred vision, No numbness in fingers and toes and I was sleeping through the night without visits to the bathroom. And I lost 16kilo in weight. Month 4 to 7. OMG. increasing to 1mg the side effects are horrendous. Weight loss has stalled, though this is probably due to lockdown. The sickness and eggy burps are constant and now my doctor says it will be at least 6 months before the side effects could be gone. But. I have no diabetic symptoms, my hba1c is pretty much normal and I think the effort has been worth it. Not an easy journey but worthwhile.",Neil

Then thought maybe it was E. coli or gastroparesis. Then I happened upon this site and started reading the reviews of ozempic. I don’t know why it would take so many months for any side effects to show, but it sounds like this is most likely the cause of my vomiting and diarrhea. I took my last dose two days ago.

I have lost some weight (about 7lbs), which with hip surgery, its rough to get out. The cravings are strange.  As one said, sugary things in the evening. I have taken care of that and eat my vegies or pop open a V8.  Believe me, a V8 will curb about any craving.  You do have to force yourself to drink water. Extremely important. Coke Zero cravings are completely gone. I still have one in a great eon.  Food appetite is down. I do take more naps than usual, but I believe that is from the reduced food intake.

The diarrhea has continued for now the third day. I literally can’t be more than 10 steps from the bathroom. I’ve only had water, chicken broth, 1 banana, 1/2 cup applesauce, 1/2 cup plain rice, and 1 cup apple juice and still can’t stay away from the bathroom. I’ve lost 7 pounds since starting Orzempic, 4 of them have been this week. This is not how I want to lose weight.",Disappointed

Initially, taking small doses up to the standard dose. I would say that I experience mild nausea for a day or so, but it's very minor and manageable. My blood sugar is normal now and I have slowly been losing weight (5 lbs so far). My appetite is definitely suppressed and I feel very full after small meal portions. The injection is so easy and pain free. I am quite pleased with this drug so far.",IanCredible
631,Semaglutide,Diabetes Type 2,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"August 23, 2018",169,"Ozempic (semaglutide):I have been on Ozempic for 2.5 weeks now and I have lost 12 pounds. I don’t eat anything fried or greasy. I watch fat intake because this medicine can make you sick if you have too much fat in what you are eating. It can also make you sick if you overeat. If you eat small - moderate meals with light snacks in between, you will probably not have any problems. If you cannot stay away from fast food and greasy pizza, you will have a problem. I have found that this medicine makes me not as hungry. It takes the edge off. It also keeps me from craving junk. I get full at meal time, eating less. I drink a lot of water too. I also use an app on my phone to log food, calories and exercise. I weigh once a week. I hope this helps someone else that is considering this drug.",Kristy

I’m waiting on my a1c this week but I’m down 13 lbs in only 10 weeks.  This has been a game changer.  I feel so much better after losing the weight.  Trulicity did'nt do much for me so glad I have something that’s easy to use,Momof3

635,Semaglutide,Diabetes Type 2,4.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"July 8, 2018",29,"Ozempic (semaglutide):I started Ozempic exactly one week ago. The nausea hit by the second day but only seemed to happen in the morning. However 5 days in, the diarrhea hit. It has been absolutely horrendous. The gurgling sounds can be heard from across a huge room. I have woken up to bowel leakage and been running to the bathroom about 10 times a day for the last 3 days. Then there’s belching which is worse than a typical burp. It’s happening regularly too. I’m really sad and afraid. I really thought this was going to help me bring down my A1c. But I don’t see how I can continue taking it. I’m calling my endo tomorrow. I need something to work but these side effects are just not livable. Especially because I work in a corporate atmosphere.",Sally
636,Semaglutide,Diabetes Type 2,8.0,,"June 27, 2018",23,"Ozempic (semaglutide):I've been taking this for 2.5 months. I've lost a solid 10 pounds. I take it right before bed so I can sleep off the initial side effects, if any. There  is little bit of diarrhea, nothing too crazy. I have major loss of appetite, I can eat half meals or half kids meal and always full after few bites. Sugars are low. The major side effect is nausea but it isn't every day. I've thrown up 3 times within the past 3 months which is something I never did prior. It comes out of no where and honestly I'm unsure if it is this injectable or just from taking iron supplement and vitamin. Could be the vitamin. I feel tired also, not sure if it's just work or a side effect. Overall I'm happy with the injectable plus it beats taking a pill every day.",Thickerthanasnicker

I have Type II Diab., and I'm trying to lose a little weight, actually a lot of weight. But I have chronic IBS, so when I started Ozempic and suffered bathroom issues, I wasn't sure it was the drug. But I started feeling really not great, stomach cramps, diarrhea, and even a little depressed? Two doses and I stopped. This is not for me...",Shelly

I had few side effects from Trulicity. My side effects from Ozempic are awful. Two to three days after a weekly dose I experienced severe diarrhea, gas, belching, nausea, lasting about 24 hours. I stopped injecting it for a couple weeks, then tried it again to confirm Ozempic was the cause. It is. I learned my lesson.",Tj

Guess that's the appetite suppressant part. After the first 3 days I started getting quite a bit of stomach discomfort and diarrhea. Anything I ate or drank went right thru me as well as gas. Also a unusual amount of belching. Hope this goes away soon and does not happen after every dose.  I teach 4 year olds and It greatly affected my ability to do my job.

640,Semaglutide,Diabetes Type 2,5.0,,"May 17, 2018",13,"Ozempic (semaglutide):Initially began Ozempic  0.25mg for 4 weeks.  Side effects were tiredness, constipation.  My fasting blood sugar numbers were lower in the morning.  When I began the 0.50mg dose @5 weeks, I had nausea, dizziness, and lethargy the day following first dose.  The second day following that dose I felt about 70% better. With the 2nd dose of 0.50mg side effects were less severe, some minor nausea, headaches and the tiredness continued.  I hope that these side effects disappear.  I plan to take this medication until I get my 3-month labs, and I expect that my A1c will be down significantly.  It was at 5.9 in July of 2017. Due to the stress of caring for a dying relative Sept. through Dec. it jumped to 9.3.  At my next appt my doctor suggested I try Ozempic in combination with Metformin 500mg @2x/day.  I received a 3-mo. discount card and have not yet checked with my health insurance provider to see if it will be covered. I am an active 61 year old female but type two diabetes does run in my mother’s family.",Hoot
