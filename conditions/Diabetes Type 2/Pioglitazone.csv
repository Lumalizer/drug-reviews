0,Pioglitazone,Diabetes Type 2,10.0,Taken for 10 years or more,"February 23, 2022",0,"Actos (pioglitazone):I have a strange reaction when I use Metformin alone. For some reason, Metformin doesn't work for me when I use it by itself. However, when combined with Pioglitazone (Actos), it works perfectly. I used to have to take Avandia with Metformin, but unfortunately, they stopped making or prescribing Avandia. I was worried nothing else would get Metformin to work for me like Avandia did, but I've been on Actos for around 10 years, and my A1C is around 5 each time it's checked. With Metformin, alone,  my A1C tends to be around 7.5 to 8! I haven't experienced any side effects at all. None! I guess some people gained weight on it, but I didn't. My weight has remained the same as when I was taking Avandia with Metformin. At any rate, I'm extremely glad Actos is available for people like me. I don't want to be on insulin and would have to be without it.",Ruby
1,Pioglitazone,Diabetes Type 2,1.0,,"January 2, 2022",3,"My husband was put on Actos generic by his VA doctor after having problems with his A1C being elevated after becoming inactive. Dose was raised to 30 mg and eventually to 45 mg with some success. After having no history of cardiac problems he developed CHF and died of a MI(heart attack). Afterwards I studied the history of this drug, including the fact that it had been taken off the market for the cardiac adverse reactions but then put back on the market. Money and Greed of Big Pharma trumps ‘science’ , facts & common sense.",Widow
2,Pioglitazone,Diabetes Type 2,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"September 18, 2021",0,"Actos (pioglitazone):I have been taking 30mg for 2 1/2 weeks now. I have had migraine headaches, blurred vision, dizziness, loss of balance, nausea and stomach pain. Severe fatigue to the point I have spent 12 out of the past 14 days in bed or the couch,  unable to do normal daily functions.  I have also gained  2 lbs, that may not sound like much, but when you take in account that I only a half of a small homemade ham sandwich or equivalent per meal, that's a lot. 2 weeks ago I weighed 148 lbs, I now weigh 150 lbs  and have been eating less than before starting Actos.",Dave65
3,Pioglitazone,Diabetes Type 2,5.0,Taken for 10 years or more,"August 4, 2021",0,"Actos (pioglitazone):I am 74 years old and have taken Actos for about 15 years and have recently gotten serious about tracking my sugar levels to indicate trends and medicine effects. I current take Lantus and 3 metformin per day and my sugar levels are in the 80-110 range consistently. I stopped take Actos and did not notice any affect on my sugar level. I am convinced that it does promote weight gain and swelling in the feet. I had no  serious side effects but as a person that has weight problems anyway it is not the medication for me. I am glad I can dispense with taking it with my current medications. For those that it does help, I have no personal experience that would cause me to say do not take it. Not doing something about the sugar levels is far more risky than the side effects of this medicine.",Gil

5,Pioglitazone,Diabetes Type 2,1.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"March 28, 2021",18,Actos (pioglitazone):I was on Actos a couple of months. My sugar levels improved just slightly but I also put on about 12 pounds within that time frame. I had a bit of hair loss and had terrible swelling of my feet and legs which I didn’t normally have an issue with. I was not thrilled about starting this to begin with because of the awful side effects ( A BIG list of them) but my doctor wanted me to try it!  Too many serious side effects for me! I just had her switch me to Glipizide. Too many meds to try without going through all of that and being miserable. Please research it if you are thinking about trying it!,Dee
6,Pioglitazone,Diabetes Type 2,1.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"February 1, 2021",24,Actos (pioglitazone):I took this medicine for around a month and a half and it did nothing for my sugar levels. It caused a 15 pound weight gain. I stopped taking it after reading the serious side effects it can cause. Why take something that is going to make me worse off than I already am?,Gg
7,Pioglitazone,Diabetes Type 2,6.0,,"January 29, 2020",16,I have been on Actos 30mg for over a year but 3 months ago I started having severe daytime drowsiness. I went to see a sleep doctor about this and they recommended some that I follow a strict sleep schedule and make a few medication changes. I called the sleep people and demanded another sleep study in case my C-PAP machine needed to be adjusted. They adjusted it but 2 weeks later there was no improvement. So they had me wear an Atigraphy Watch for a week to see how much I slept among many other things to keep track of. They called today 1/29/2020 and said it must be a drug that I am taking. I told them that there isn't any new medications I am taking. Almost all of them I have been on for years. But as I was napping in the afternoon as usual it crossed my mind that there are 2 drugs that I have not been taking for several years. Actos & Jardiance. So I looked up the side-effects of these drugs and BAM! there it is for Actos....Extreme Fatigue. I am NOT taking this drug.,Gamera1969

9,Pioglitazone,Diabetes Type 2,6.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"August 13, 2019",15,"Took Pioglitazone for about 8 months or so, all was OK, my numbers were down for a while, but now I have gained weight, the numbers stay the same, I feel tired, dizzy, I was swelling from the waist down all the way to my feet to the point that I had a hard time getting into my clothes. I contacted the Dr and he reduced the dosage, but I felt the same the fatigue continued and so the swelling. I was not myself anymore, I  decided to stop taking the pioglitazone on my own for about three weeks now and I am back in action, my numbers have not changed, I feel alive again, the swelling has gone down a bit, but the fatigue is gone. I will give my doctor one more chance to find an alternative medication, if none available will look to change to another doctor for sure.1.0",Jimmy the Cricket

Leg and abdominal edema was considerable resulting in weight gain, pelvic floor pressure with less bladder control. Went off for a couple months then tried again at lower dose. Leg edema not as noticeable but again had me thinking I had a UTI which I again did not, cultured to confirm.  I was on the med for 5 weeks each time and problems worsened, which after that long I would expect them to decrease. This med is definitely not for me.",JennyJen

My lows are more predictable and are not as frequent. Off setting the lows temporarily is easily accomplished with food or juice. I have not experienced any swelling, nor any side effects that I am aware of other than the occasional lows (80s).
