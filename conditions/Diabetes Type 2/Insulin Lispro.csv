0,Insulin Lispro,Diabetes Type 2,8.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"December 25, 2021",2,"Humalog KwikPen (insulin lispro):Been using these pens for about 1 year. Mostly they work well. But, have noticed that they are inconsistent in strength from one lot to another. Let's say I'm finishing a pen where my numbers are beautiful. When that's empty I start using a new pen with a different lot number. Suddenly my numbers are crazy high. Same foods and exercise. I have to inject more units with next meal just to bring my numbers back down. Pharmacy gave me a new pen as an experiment. Sure enough my numbers when back to normal immediately.  Went back to old pen and high numbers again. Called Lily to report this and they blame me for ""doing something wrong"".",Frustrated
1,Insulin Lispro,Diabetes Type 2,1.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"July 26, 2021",0,I've been on lispro for 8 months and my sugar reading have ran high. For 3 years on humalog my a1c has been 4.7 to 6. Now it's 8. Lispro doesn't work.,Nikki
2,Insulin Lispro,Diabetes Type 2,3.0,Taken for 10 years or more,"May 2, 2021",0,"I have been using humalog and now insulin lispro for 15 years.  I have no issue with the insulin but the pens leave much to be desired.  They skip, jam and don't work well with BD pen tips.  The quality of these pens is nothing like the pen I use for Levimir.  I have never had a problem with a Levimir pen.  Lilly should be ashamed of this product.  If I could change, I would.",Tom
3,Insulin Lispro,Diabetes Type 2,7.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"April 18, 2021",0,"I use the Humalog 75/25 and I have not had any problems with the pens or the medicines efficiency. Then I switched to the generic because it was cheaper and supposedly just as good. It isn't.  You have to use 1 1/2 more product of the generic as you do the original dosage, to  get the same effect.  I will be switching back to the original when my generic runs out.",Anonymous
4,Insulin Lispro,Diabetes Type 2,1.0,Taken for 5 to 10 years,"March 24, 2021",2,"Humalog KwikPen (insulin lispro):Humalog KwikPern 200 unit insulin products have been defective for years and continue being defective. Since too much or too little fast-acting Insulin can cause death, this is a very serious matter.The mechanism in those devices ams and skips gears and this is visible as the plunger does not move or moved way too much resulting in too little or too much insulting being injected.Lilly's phone line connects hapless patients to a labyrinth of submenus of byzantine complexity that it is useless, possibly by design.",Defrauded end user

6,Insulin Lispro,Diabetes Type 2,7.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"February 17, 2021",1,"Admelog (insulin lispro):This medication was prescribed to me with instructions that I should use it on a sliding scale, depending on what my blood sugar is reading and what I'll be eating. I've discovered that if I follow this guideline closely, it works great. For example: A BS reading of 124 just before eating an apple calls for me injecting 4 units of the medication, just enough to keep the natural sugar of the apple pushing me too high. Yet, that same BS reading of 124 just before eating a bowl of Honey Bunches of Oats with whole milk...well, that requires me to inject 10 units to compensate for all that fake sugar. When that is kept in mind and closely monitored, this medication is a winner. As for side effects...I developed an occasional case of nasal and throat congestion due to taking it, but a very minor dose of any OTC decongestant takes care of that.",Kate

8,Insulin Lispro,Diabetes Type 2,2.0,,"August 15, 2020",9,Humalog KwikPen (insulin lispro):I never had problems with novalog pens but this humalog pen is horrible! I watch my diet carefully so I don't have to use as often but when my blood sugar shoots up I need it. Twice the same pen stopped working so I had to take of back to the pharmacy. Every humalog pen I have used since you have to keep pumping and twisting so that you end up with bruises! It never delivers what you put it on so you actually don't know how much you are injecting! This product is horrible and those making it should either make it right or be accountable!!!,Sweet girl
9,Insulin Lispro,Diabetes Type 2,9.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"July 17, 2020",1,"Humalog KwikPen (insulin lispro):The Humalog KwikPen insulin works well but I have had the issue of my pens jamming, sticking, and just not working. I called the number on the paper that was in the box with the pens. I spoke to the nicest young man and he helped me fix my pen then gave me some advice on how to avoid these issues in the future. He even got me a replacement because I ended up throwing a broke  pen away before I could finish using it (~100 units left).",Anonymous
10,Insulin Lispro,Diabetes Type 2,1.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"July 1, 2020",1,I have used the cheapest insulin in the world but this is not insulin this is 100 percent rubbish and someone is making a lot of money off a product that doesn't work,Anonymous
11,Insulin Lispro,Diabetes Type 2,4.0,,"April 6, 2020",6,"Humalog KwikPen (insulin lispro):I've been using these  Humalog Kwikpens for almost 2 years. I have had issues with half of them. They won't inject correctly!! I've tried different things like doing less for each press and sometimes that helps. I've jiggled & moved it and nope.. what annoys me  even more is looking at a brand new pen I have to throw away because IT JUST DOESN'T WORK!! I've talked to the pharmacist and they say to contact Novalog,  I sent info to novalog and no response.. I will have to ask my doctor to put me on something else. This feeling that you paid for a cheap toy that breaks as soon as you get it home. I do not recommend this AT ALL!!",LOST.CUSTOMER
12,Insulin Lispro,Diabetes Type 2,1.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"March 13, 2020",3,Admelog (insulin lispro):This is unacceptable to give people this medicine. Playing with others life for money. My blood sugar have been over 290 every day no matter what I eat. I could eat a salad and check and it goes from 136- to over 200. What is this stuff? It is making the pancreas weaker or destroying it slowly while slowly destroying us body and falling apart. Back was ok for awhile but since my body went into keto acidosis its severe back degenerate. Ketoacidosis It destroys the muscle and fat. Never had that in my life. I lost so much weight and in so much pain.,Jayno8
13,Insulin Lispro,Diabetes Type 2,1.0,,"February 27, 2020",5,Humalog KwikPen (insulin lispro):These pens are terrible. The company should be closed down. They malfunction and some times have to inject my self 3 times to get my dosage. My insurance made me get these but I we I'll pay to use lantis solostar. Dont get this product!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!@!!!!!!!!!!!!,Deb
14,Insulin Lispro,Diabetes Type 2,1.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"January 5, 2020",2,"This is life threatening, do not trust this medication. I have been on insulin since the early 90's and on my (many) versions of insulin I have been able to somewhat control my sugar. I have had many times in which my levels would climb to over 400-500 and had emergency care. I have been on this for a few months and I cannot control my levels, some days I will use a pen and all is OK, but then 50% of the time I get a pen that  does nothing, tonight for example I took my normal amount at my normal time, I felt bad so I check my sugars, 3 hours after taking the injection and my meter read high glucose over 600 on multiple tests to ensure machine did not error. This stuff is dangerous to the point of being life endangering.  It has put me in the ER 3 times in the past 5 weeks. I am contacting the company on this issue as it has become a liability",c&j

I then took 30 u Admelog (a huge amount). I ate a big bowl of Cheerios with a banana, some sugar, and ingested about 15 oz of rice milk (I drank half of that). THREE HOURS and 23 MIN LATER, at 11:52, MY BS was 218! I just took another 30 units of it. I've had no further carbs. I received and opened the styrofoam Admelog case on November 8.

I developed shortness of breath, increased heart rate, sinusitis and the feeling like I had something in my throat when I laid down. I also had severe lumbar sacral back pain.  I could only stand or walk for about 10 minutes.  I had to stop insulin for insurance reasons and that is when I realized it was the insulin.  Symptoms stopped within about 24 hours.",Hawaiian girl
17,Insulin Lispro,Diabetes Type 2,5.0,Taken for 5 to 10 years,"November 3, 2019",12,"Humalog (insulin lispro):I've been on Humalog for several years, I've tried Novalog and Apidra and both have given me terrible side effects.  Humalog also gave me side effects and have noticed that throughout the years it has gotten worse, the headaches start from the back of my head, then it works it way down the back of my neck and spine.  It has also creates an upset stomach that leads to acid reflux, chest pains and an increase in blood pressure.  It has sent me to the ER several times, at first not realizing it was the insulin causing all the problems.  When I stopped it to use Apidra, all the symptoms disappeared for about a week until I started getting other side effects from the Apidra that were worse and I had no choice but to go back to Humalog, I seem to have run out of options, it's I'm damned if I do, damned if I don't...in search of a better solution before it kills me...",Rick

The Novalog Pen worked very well and I never had any issues with it.  Since switching to the Humalog Pen, I've had constant problems getting it to work properly. The part that gets pushed down often gets stuck and it becomes impossible to administer the insulin that I need to manage my Type 2 Diabetes.  I don't understand why the insurance companies have to change from a perfectly good product to one that is substandard.
