1,Metformin,Diabetes Type 2,7.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"March 12, 2022",0,"Glucophage XR (metformin):Been taking 1000XR x2 for 6 months. diagnosed with horrible stats : A1C 9.8! and cholesterol. I'm not overweight and BM is less than 24. Insulin levels ok but terrible resistance. My biggest problem: low muscle mass. Metformin helped in reducing A1C along with exercise and carb counting to A1C 5.6 within 6 months and statins reduced my cholesterol to half. That's the good news (statistically), the bad is that unlike others with diarrhea I have had had hard pebble poop (classed as constipation) from day one, plus lack of energy in the morning. Now my dosage is 500mg in the evening but problems with my stomach persist although the lower dosage allows me to work on my body mass : proteins + heavy exercise and it really works. A year later A1C is still below 6 (5.8) which is very good news plus I have more muscles that I put to training every hour and every day. I am now looking for alternative Metformin manufacturers to get rid of chronic constipation. It is different for everyone...",T2 DM 51

I gained weight constantly, I weighed in at 196lbs on Feb 20. Now 2 months later on glucophage I have lost 29 lbs, and I eat like a normal person. I can't believe the difference. The first week on it I had some nausea but it went away and I now have no side effects. I keep thinking this is a fluke, a pill can't make that much of a difference. I feel better than I have in 20 years, I now have energy because I am eating enough and my readings are amazing.",leeni

Coupled with Armour Thyroid and Iodral my cravings for sweets and spicy are much less and I have been able to stick to the diet for 1200 calories and journal for the past 7 days which is a record for me.  After my last visit and B12 shot I have been told to double the thyroid if I began to feel tired after a few days again.",cuteasabug
