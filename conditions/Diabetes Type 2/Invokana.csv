0,Invokana,Diabetes Type 2,1.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"November 17, 2021",0,"I was put on Invokana by my Diabetic doctor for just under a year. This summer I was visiting my husbands family on Vancouver Island. I should say I had been having rather a lot of pain in my vagina for a few weeks before the visit. The day after arriving, the next morning I could hardly walk the pain was so severe. I went into town with my husband and his sister and visited a health/wellness store. Where I brought some Cranberry Complex and a tube of Canesten for internal use. It did solve the pain to a degree. However the continues pain and soreness was not going away. I made an appointment with my GP on my return home. he took a swab and said to continue with the Cranberry Complex and Canesten. As I can see my results on line, I noted there was no infection. Both my doctors suggested that I stop taking taking Invokana. I have been off it for two months. And I must say it has taking this long for the pain and irritation to go away/stop.This is not a drug for me. 100mgs once a day.",MBKyle

2,Invokana,Diabetes Type 2,10.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"June 11, 2021",3,I have been on Invokana for 3.5 years. In the beginning I had horrid yeast infections and my PCP had me visit my GYN who put me on a 6 month dose of Diflucan to reset my body's pH and I haven't had issues in years. I also had the muscle cramps and fatigue but realized it was dehydration and resolved it by drinking more water. My last A1C was 5.1 so I asked my PCP if I could go from 300mg to 100mg and 3 agreed to a 3 month trial. I'm starting my 3rd month of 100mg and next month I get my A1C checked and I'm hoping to stay on 100mg. I'm down 110lbs. I'm hoping if all goes well on the 100mg than additional 70lbs down I can go off medication completely.,Jess121178

I went in to get my prescription my insurance company said this will be the last time they paid for it then I found out why.

It helps with my sugars but the vaginal itching is so intense I thought I was going to have a mental breakdown!  I've been off it for almost a week now and still the itching won't go away!

He was hospitalized with a sugar level of 833 and a ketoacidosis diagnosis.  6 days later he had the first of 5 operations for genital gangrene.  His urological surgeon said he had only a 30% chance to survive.  After 111 days in the hospital he needed home health care for 5 more months.

I've not seen a blood test result like that  in years. Also lost 2 lbs. After reading all the negative reviews I was so hesitant about trying this drug.

Over the years the side effects have grown more intense and frequent. It's miserable! Within the last two weeks I have started having discomfort and a burning feeling in my right foot.

69,Invokana,Diabetes Type 2,1.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"April 17, 2017",35,"At first I liked it. My Endocrinologist was waiting for it to be approved and available, so put me on it once it was. It lowered my Blood Sugar and my Blood Pressure. I did not lose weight as some do (which I suspect is mostly water weight from urinating more).  I had to stop my blood pressure medicine because I felt I was bottoming out with both meds (Invokana was lowering my blood pressure too). But now that I have been taking Invokana, since it was available, I just recently stopped it due to not being able to handle the side effects anymore. I feel so FATIQUED ALL the time. My muscles ache once I get to the top of my stairs. I am out of breath and feel like I have run a marathon. My chest would feel tight and just felt faint all the time when doing anything! Add life's stresses (job) to that, and it made me so miserable!!And, I have been working out 4 days a week since Jan!! It is so frustrating. I am also on week 4 of a nothing but veggie and some fruit smoothies (no meat, wheat, and only dairy is whole fat Greek yogurt). So I figured since I was having to watch my blood sugars more closely, since they were lower with this new eating plan, now was a good time to quit the Invokana. I am hoping within a week I might feel like my old self again. Due to doing EVERYTHING I can to HELP my Diabetes, and I still felt bad, I knew it had to be my Invokana. The only other med I take is Lantis SolarStar. I started to get worried about long term effects of Invokana, especially since I was doing what anyone with health issues should do (exercise and eat super healthy), and still felt fatigued, I decided to do more research online and have found MANY others with my SAME and worse side effects. Many complain of constant yeast infections (both women and men), hair loss, swelling of lymph nodes to where they did STD tests and cancer screening, shortness of breath, fatigue, urinary tract infections, bladder infections, kidney issues (some really bad). I got scared reading so many many bad reviews. I don't want to end up with major kidney problems!!So I am going to do what every Type II Diabetic should do, and actually EAT HEALTHY and EXERCISE!! We are switching to organic foods and plan to continue drinking these green smoothies for 2 meals a day and have a reasonable dinner. We need to lose weight anyways. That will ensure we get tons of veggies and fruits and so much nutrition that we would otherwise be deficient in. We keep track of all our calories to ensure we get enough protein, and healthy fat etc. I also take some supplements, super foods, and vitamins made with whole food. We are going to stop all soda, sugar, artificial sweeteners, and pre-made and highly processed foods, as best we can...it will be a process, lol. . I am so mad at all that is put in our food, I can't believe it is legal!!. Most chronic type diseases are due to inflammation in the body and what we PUT in our bodies. Healthy in, healthy out. Crap in, crap out. You ARE what you eat. Stop putting chemicals and toxins in your body. Stop eating food that is not raised/cultivated naturally healthy. Eat whole food and ""clean"" foods.

It's also a smart drug, so it will stop being as effective when you are close to normal levels. So you won't drop too low.

Double my water intake. Yeast infection a couple of times but none since. This has been a life saver for me.",4sue

I feel great exercising again losing weight, but having the vaginal infections I hope as my body adjusts this will go away. Been diabetic since 2009 tried many meds. And this has been the best for me. I would recommend anyone to try it!",Jill Lavonne
249,Invokana,Diabetes Type 2,8.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"September 5, 2013",75,"I just started taking Invokana exactly 2 weeks ago, I have lost 4 lbs so far (great).  My fasting sugars went from 274 down to 206 (nice improvement so far).  I still need to get them under 100 though and I feel the longer I take this medication - the more improvement I will see.  The only side effect so far is the frequent urination which is caused by the dehydration. This makes me drink more water of course - but since that is the only issue I have I really can't complain. I personally think this new medication is a ""winner"".",darkchocolit
250,Invokana,Diabetes Type 2,6.0,,"September 4, 2013",35,"I started taking Invokana about 2 weeks or so ago.  I have been Type 2 diabetes for 15 years.  Last year I had to start insulin in addition to the metformin ER and glimiperide I have been taking.  I have been trying desperately to lose weight too.  My doc let me go on phentermine 3 months ago, and I lost 12 lbs in 3 months.  I needed to lose 35-40 more.  My last A1C was 6.9, up from 6.6 the 3 months preceding.  So, doc told me about this new medicine.  She stopped my glimiperide and I still take 2000mg metformin ER (split am/pm) and she cut my insulin to 11 units am, 20units pm.  My sugars have gone up, fasting is now between 124-150 (whereas before they were 90-120), and 2 hrs after I'm around 178. ",Shorty323
251,Invokana,Diabetes Type 2,8.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"August 27, 2013",47,"Been on Invokana for a week now. My blood sugars have been significantly reduced. I am also watching my diet, very low carbs. Still have not lost any weight, which was the reason why I was put on this medicine to begin with. My A1C went from a 9.9 to a 7.3 at last weeks endocirnologist appointment. I wonder if I should let this go for a bit longer. I had hoped to see some weight loss during this time, but haven't lost a pound. I have noticed only a slight increase in urination and haven't really been thirsty. Maybe it hasn't been long enough. Any ideas? Oh, and my insurance covered this right from the beginning. I didn't need the rebate card. That was nice.",Mrs Cashdollar

254,Invokana,Diabetes Type 2,8.0,,"May 31, 2013",111,"Very happy with this new medicine. Seems to control my blood sugar better than other medications. I also take 2000mg of Glucophage a day and 100mg of the Invokana. After the first month, the maintenance dosage is 300mg once a day. Been on this medication for 3 weeks now. I have already lost 5 pounds! Urination is more frequent during the day though. Make sure you drink lots of fluids to prevent dehydration. I did notice some acne to show up on my face. Not sure if this is a side effect or not? Other than that, this is a miracle! Controlled blood sugars and weight loss! The first year is only $5.00 a month with the prescription card the Manufacturer gives you.",Eevee
