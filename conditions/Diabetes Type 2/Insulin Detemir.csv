The only problem I have is that the pens don't work a lot of the time. They are really slow or don't get all my insulin in & I have to finish with another shot. I also take NovoLog & have never had a problem w/their pens.,Wilson

7,Insulin Detemir,Diabetes Type 2,1.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"January 11, 2021",0,"Levemir (insulin detemir):I was prescribed Lantus in 2014, my insurance changed it to Basaglar a few years later. With both of those my A1C average was under 8. My insurance changed my prescription to Levemir in April 2020 and my last 2 test results were 11.0 in June and 11.1 in November. My eating habits haven't changed nor has my exercise. My doctor increased my dosage by 50% and my daily numbers are still HIGH. If it isn't that the Levemir is not working its a weird coincidence.",Jake

9,Insulin Detemir,Diabetes Type 2,10.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"February 24, 2020",4,"Levemir (insulin detemir):I was diagnosed as a type 2 diabetic with an average BSL averaging 200-250 in 2017 and put on 40 units Levemir at 0600 hrs daily.  Now BSL fasting averaging 95-105.  Biggest health issue was finding Synthroid and the other Lab made cholesterol drugs play havoc with my system.  Once on Armour Thyroid all my blood numbers moved to where they belong and I have lost 60 pounds with another 60-70 to go.  I am a type 2 diabetic and have to watch what I eat and how much I eat or my BSL climes fast.  I now use the Levemir to assist my body's insulin production.  Below 100 I don't take it.  Above 100 I use on a sliding scale to 40 units (if BSL 15 take 15 units, if BSL 131 take 31 units).  I love the convenience of the pen and the ability to very depending on my bodies need in the morning.",Bob
10,Insulin Detemir,Diabetes Type 2,8.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"June 9, 2019",13,"Levemir (insulin detemir):I have only using it  for  no more than  a months and it does work on me. But the only thing I don't like is that many times especially the last time, when I am injected myself the Levemir Pen don't work well. I press it like your suppose to  but it doesn't work & it takes time, so I have to wait 'til the pen decides to release the insulin & keep on pressing. Once it reaches the Zero I release my finger pull out the pen & the insulin shoots out some insulin which should have gone into me. Maybe it never gave me any insulin & now that the needle its out it shoots the insulin onto my belly and realized I am wasting the insulin.  ",andre
11,Insulin Detemir,Diabetes Type 2,,,"January 15, 2019",3,"Levemir (insulin detemir):Been taking Levemir for a few months now. I started with 10 units and every three days. I would speak with the diabetic nurse to discuss my fasting BS #’s and we would increase 3 units until my fasting #’s improved. I use Metformin 1000mg (twice daily), Januvia 100mg (mornings with breakfast), and Levemir 35 units (every 24hrs in the mornings before I leave for work) Before July 2018 I was only taking 1000mg metformin twice daily; I went to the doctor and my blood sugar level was over 300. In July I started taking Januvia and Levemir along with the metformin and I do feel the difference and also see the difference in my numbers. My A1c in July was 12.4 and 10.1 in November. I’m due to go back now and can’t wait to see how much lower my A1c has gotten. My only side effect has been constipation and I take Miralax daily. The only warning I would give is to take the medication as early as possible, I’ve noticed that if I wait too late in the day to take it, I suffer from low BS's.",Ousu1122
12,Insulin Detemir,Diabetes Type 2,1.0,Taken for 10 years or more,"June 26, 2018",17,"Levemir (insulin detemir):My diabetes was controlled with Lantus, which kept my blood sugar A1c between 6.8-7.4 generally.My health insurance prescribed Levemir.  Since then, I've gained weight, blood sugars now 330-440 range. 100-140 was normal before.  My eye ached this morning.  I had been warned by my eye doctor that high blood sugars could blind me, causing blood vessels to burst behind my retina.  Yep, another 330.  Levemir is fake insulin, at least for me.  Was this developed for Type 1?  It isn't much cheaper, so the insurance company game is, favor certain companies for friendly deals, rather than good medicine.  I'm angry because I only recently received sight after both eyes had cataracts for years.  Losing it at 75 years of age is too hard to bear.",Feather

14,Insulin Detemir,Diabetes Type 2,2.0,,"February 11, 2018",11,"Levemir (insulin detemir):I was put on it last year.  I inadvertently missed a couple of doses and my blood sugar actually went down in the morning all but once.  The exercise works, oral medications work, vitamins work (a little), levemir really does not appear effective.  I also upped the dosage  and my fasting bs went up by 20-30 points with a 4 unit increase.  Depending on the next A1C reading I may start decreasing my dose to see what will happen.",Safety guy
15,Insulin Detemir,Diabetes Type 2,,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"July 14, 2017",9,Levemir (insulin detemir):Did not know your insulin could make you dizzy lethargic tired joints aching back hurting and conditions mentioned by these patients.  Levemir may not be for me.  I switched because I thought it would be cheaper than lantus.  Was surprised it's costs are also horrific.  I may see my doctor to go back on lantus.  ,Botsey

I take it at 9 everynight, yet my blood sugar first thing in the morning was still 154. We try and keep it under 140. Before it was usually under 200. My last A1C was 7.2  I'm so tired, very weak, can only walk for 10 yards without stopping to rest.  My heart pounds too. I called my endo doc and he now wants to supplement it with Novolog, to control meal spikes. Now I'm afraid to take it because it may make me feel even worse. I've been so careful with what I eat and have lost 7 pounds, but I feel like garbage. Any ideas, anyone?? Have I just not been on Levemir long enough for my body to adapt?",mhami
