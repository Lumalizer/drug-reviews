0,NovoLog,Diabetes Type 2,6,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"January 28, 2022",0,I use both Novolog and a slow acting insulin. At first Novolog worked pretty well after meals but then I started to see a delay and a continued spike after two hours. I have seen improvement in fasting BGL but I have also gained back some weight I had lost just on the slow insulin. Using fast acting insulin is more frustrating because it adds in more monitoring on BGL and you risk injecting too much causing low blood sugars. I just think your best trying to avoid using insulin as long as you can because it is sort of a grind to start using insulin.,JohnIL
1,NovoLog,Diabetes Type 2,1,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"July 6, 2021",3,"On bolus regimen (rapid + long acting) since early 2021 and developed painful neuropathy in thighs/legs that is worsening to the point of insomnia. The sharp pains sensations feel like sewing needles. Doctor didn't know the cause, and want to test thyroid which was negative when hospitalized for DKA. It is always best to read package insert from the manufacturer because it contains more detail. I learned all insulin products reduce potassium levels (low K can cause muscle cramps, burning, even death) and rapid glycemic control is ""associated with"" transitory eye refractive disorder, worsening retinopathy and ""acute painful peripheral neuropathy"". This has another name: Treatment-Induced Diabetic Neuropathy. I believe PN becomes chronic once it starts as long as you're using Novolog.",Painful
2,NovoLog,Diabetes Type 2,1,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"April 17, 2020",7,"I put on A LOT of weight with this novolog insulin.  No diet changes, but gained60 lbs in a year.   I was taking 15 units 3x a day.  I kept hearing ""hang in there"".   ""give it time to adjust to your body.""  So now, my blood sugars are worse thanks to the extra weight, thanks to Novolg flex pen.  I also experienced not urinating enough, & ankle swelling.  Probably because this stuff won't let you urinate.  Did it lower my blood sugar?  Of course!   It's insulin.  But at the cost of putting on 60 lbs?  Not worth it.  I finally stopped it even though my idiot doctor disagreed.  Yeah, Doc, I'll keep taking it until I can't  fit out of my door way.  Ridiculous!  I worked hard to lose 60 lbs.",MARYMILL
3,NovoLog,Diabetes Type 2,8,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"January 6, 2020",4,"I assume the Novolog insulin is doing what it is designed to do, my complaint is with the delivery pen!!! It gets stuck and will not plunge thereby leaving the insulin unusable. Humalog has a better pen!!!!!",Scoe
4,NovoLog,Diabetes Type 2,3,Taken for less than 1 month,"August 21, 2019",4,Started novalog on Friday. Amazing bloodsugar control. However by Monday I was in the er with chest pains and shortness of breath. Hospital  said this medicine caused it. Then I look on their site and it says it right on side effect list. Will never take it again!!!!,Anonymous
5,NovoLog,Diabetes Type 2,10,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"July 25, 2019",5,I take a combination of Novolog R and N. It has worked just as well as the High dollar medications that I had taken in the past. I was taking some high dollar medications and always ran through my insurance coverage after 6 months. After moving back to Kansas from Missouri my specialist here changed me to the Novolog regimen which is all out of pocket but cheaper than 6 month of out of coverage for the high dollar medication.,Stitchmama
6,NovoLog,Diabetes Type 2,7,,"May 2, 2019",4,"Been on Novolog a month, also using Basaglar 30 units a day and Metformin ER. A1c too high at 9.1 so doctor told me I needed to try short acting insulin. Costs is high one pen as $107 I pay $325 for 5 Basaglar pens. Seems like this disease is making drug companies wealthy. I do see improvement  when using the Novolog when I take it at big meal when carb intake higher. Has improved fasting levels. But the cost will prevent me from sticking with it. Insurance pays some I hope but I went off Lantus because of costs. I think Lantus worked better then Basaglar but that's just my own observation and experience. I've tried Januvia, Starlix, Victoza, and none really work consistently even being on a low carb diet. Besides the insulin is affecting my weight in a negative way which can't be good for insulin resistance. After awhile the injected insulin probably also become resistant to cell intake. So then you take more and more. Yeah a expensive band aid for a disease that fights back.",John IL
7,NovoLog,Diabetes Type 2,8,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"August 17, 2016",4,"Novolog pen does not glide well when giving yourself a shot. The medication worked well for me with minimal side affects. I have been on it for 2 yrs, but my coupon has expired & I cannot afford it now.",Anonymous
8,NovoLog,Diabetes Type 2,7,Taken for 5 to 10 years,"April 29, 2015",9,"Have used Novolog for 9-10 years.  I has reasonably helped with controlling my glucose but has caused considerable weight gain.  My units are determined by the carbohydrate count per meal - that has been adjusted from a ratio of 10 to a ratio of 7 per unit.  A new endocrinologist has suggested Januvia but the side effects sound horrendous.  The other 5 oral medications I've tried over a period of years did nothing positive and actually caused too many gastrointestinal problems.  Will decide in 3 months, at next appointment.",5DoxMom
9,NovoLog,Diabetes Type 2,7,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"January 7, 2014",6,"Good for lowering blood sugar and quick but the side effects were bad, it caused severe itching and a bad rash running down both of the inside of my legs. Heading in to get it changed to something new.",Dia 2
10,NovoLog,Diabetes Type 2,1,,"May 17, 2013",7,"Serious allergic reaction, hives and extreme itching.",Gads12
11,NovoLog,Diabetes Type 2,3,,"August 5, 2011",33,"After trying several insulin types of medicines which caused severe itching, I was put on Novolog 70/30. At first there were no side effects, then dizziness started to occur and its getting worse, my ankles are starting to swell and I am putting on weight. I'm at my wits end.  Novolog is very convenient to use, but unfortunately now I have to go back to doctor and start a new medication and go through trial and error with a new medication which can also be very costly.",Anonymous
