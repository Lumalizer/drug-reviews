0,Farxiga,Diabetes Type 2,8.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"March 15, 2022",0,"I had to rob the bank to pay for it. My fasting stick numbers are relatively stable but way above target. They became high after my first COVID 19 vaccine last March. My Dr. Increased my dosage of Glimepiride from 1 to 4 mg first, then added this in January. I experience both bowel & bladder incontinence due to chronic degenerative osteoarthritis that generates untreatable pain. I use to be functional. Then, the CDC reclassified Hydrocodone to a type 2 narcotic. And left me and millions of others to suffer. Most people who take this pain reliever never become addicts. Just become non- working disabled.",Chuck
1,Farxiga,Diabetes Type 2,10.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"September 23, 2021",1,"I started out taking Trulicity once a week with Trajenta once a day.  Loved my low A1c which came down to 5.8 without much work on my part.  However, I developed gastroparesis.  Although Trulicity is awesome with once a week injection (not insulin), the symptoms with gastroparesis were just too much.  Anyway my endo put me on Xigduo (Farxiga 5 mg / 1000 mg metformin combo) in July 2020.  My A1c started creeping up to 6.8.  I wasn't happy with that so she added another 5 mg of Farxiga to be taken with Xigduo.  I have been doing great.  A1c is down to 6.0 and I've lost 20 pounds since January 2021 without really any work on my part.  Believe me I am not the perfect diabetic either.  I have always drank tons of water so peeing all the time has always been part of my life.  Plus I have no more gastroparesis symptoms.",bluehens
2,Farxiga,Diabetes Type 2,1.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"September 20, 2021",1,"I was previously on farxiga 10mg for 1 year. I had extreme thirstiness, urgency when urinating, and finally genital swelling. I discontinued due to this 3 weeks ago and the swelling persist. It worked at first to keep my AIC in check but soon I started having an increase in appetite picking up 5lbs. My fasting started to increase because I was doing late nite snacking.I was on Metformin XR  2000 before they did the recall, which worked well for me. I am now back on Metformin 1500 and have not had any of the side effects except insomnia if I take it after 7pm",maroatl

In the first month, I lost almost 15 lb... After the 2nd month, I have lost 20 lb and make progress with other health issues that were affected by my weight.My husband's diabetes is still a work-in-progress, but for him this was the medication that finally got control over the diabetes and allowed the Dr to stop long-acting insulin.I cannot say if my reduced appetite is due to the medication or do to finally adjusting to eating smaller portion sizes. I cannot list any negatives from taking the drug, and I'm the type of person that always has some type of random or rare reaction.Before adding Farxiga, I was on Metformin, Ozempic, and my thyroid was in...

28,Farxiga,Diabetes Type 2,1.0,,"June 14, 2019",105,"I was on Farxiga for over two years and thought it was my wonder drug. My blood sugar control was excellent. All was well until a year ago when suddenly I was being flown by helicopter to the nearest ICU. I was in a coma and in end stage (DKA) Diabetic Ketoacidosis. I woke up three days later to learn what had happened to me. I was informed that the Farxiga was the cause. I haven’t fully recovered and have been unable to control my sugars since. I’m writing this to encourage people to educate themselves on what DKA is and the signs. My blood sugar was only 7 when I first went to the ER, and by the time I was being flown out, it had climbed to over 40. Signs for me we’re sudden onset weakness and shortness of breath, nausea, vomiting, severe headache and muscle pain, loss of appetite leading to extreme breathing problems (kussmal breathing) and finally unconsciousness.

Farxiga was terrible for my A1c. 3 months ago it was 8.4 and now just tested at 8.2. Not good. My doctor just added Bydureon Bcise back with Farxiga as I have been on Farxiga for at least 10 months and blood sugars are the most terrible I have ever had in my life while taking Farxiga. Hoping taking Bydureon again will have the great effects in controlling blood sugar as before. Had to go off Bydureon in the past due to insurance denial and cost. Doctor gave me a savings card to bypass the ""bull"" and outrageous cost from the insurance company. Too bad the insurance companies are only out for the money and not the health of people.

I started with a fasting reading of 360, and in those 6 weeks have regular readings below 180 after eating.  I have had slight side effects - some headaches and dehydration (I think the headaches are actually linked to being dehydrated), and a lot of urinating, but so far nothing major.  Bonus - I've even lost about 8 pounds in that time with very little change to my eating habits (I still eat sweets, but have cut back a some, but not nearly as much as I should) and adding very moderate exercise, like walking an extra 30 minutes a couple times a week.  I'm basically trying to keep to 60-75 g of carbs for each meal, and this has worked well for me.

Prior to taking I started myself on a daily probiotic, immune booster, and fish oil supplements. I drink ONLY water. I don't eat sweets. I don't drink added sugar beverages. I push a great deal of water through my system to stay hydrated and avoid infection. So far, no side effects other than increased urine output, which sometimes aggravates my nether regions (& some slight cramping), nothing unbearable; I just drink MORE water. Give it a chance, all medications have side effects. I tried Metformin first and had the worst GI upset of my life, and that was after only 1 dose. Everyone's bodies respond differently. I would like to add that this medication creates more sugar in the urine, so taking it and ingesting more sugar is only causing your body more strain... you're a diabetic anyways!",GIVEitAchance

Started to experience dizziness and then fainting while on Farxiga.  After a month, I went back to metformin.  Feel 1,000 percent better without being dizzy all of the time.  Not worth the expense for a drug that doesn't work",Littleton

116,Farxiga,Diabetes Type 2,10.0,,"February 6, 2015",42,"As a paraplegic with obesity and Type II diabetes that was out of control, It was very nice to see my numbers come down finally. This medicine is Highly effective at reducing the glucose for me.I believe the reason that I have not had any yeast infection is because I wear a indwelling catheter. So when urine rarely ever touches the skin around my genitals, or anywhere else. I believe that with proper care of the skin around the (male) genitalia, ie washing the tip of the penis after urination, would reduce or perhaps even eliminate any problems with yeast infection. It is only my opinion, as I am NOT a physician or in any medical field.I've been on this medicine for almost a year and have reduced my HA1C almost down to 6 from 8.7.",TonyH64
117,Farxiga,Diabetes Type 2,9.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"January 28, 2015",38,"I've been on this med for 9 months. I'm also on Victoza, 2000mg Metformin. My a1c has dropped from upper 7's to 6.5. Blood pressure readings have dropped to normal range. I've always had issues with male yeast infections and was concerned when I first started this medicine. I apply a steriod/antifungal cream at the slightest hint of redness, this has kept the issue under control. The more sugar you consume, the more you will urinate. I think I have mentally reduced my sugar intake just knowing that. I've lost over 30lbs also.",ilikepie
118,Farxiga,Diabetes Type 2,1.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"January 14, 2015",53,"Had a constant yeast infection and 3 urinary tract infections in the two months I was on it. I was so thirsty, I would drink a gallon of water at work. I urinated every 20 minutes. My bladder was sore if my belly was touched. I really tried and wanted this to work. I did lose about 12 pounds and had energy. But I was depressed from constant ""female Issues"". It just got worse and worse. I took myself off this pill and am back on Metformin XR. Waiting to see my doc for the next plan of attack. This did not work for me.",Another failure for me!!
