0,Basaglar,Diabetes Type 2,2.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"March 18, 2022",0,"I was on Lantus for 2+ years and it had worked well. I was switched to Baslagar due to insurance no longer approving coverage for Lantus. Since switching my blood glucose is higher than it was when on Lantus plus having issues such as stomach pain/issues, leg cramps, insomnia, tinnitus, headaches etc. The Baslagar pens are often faulty and don't dispense the correct dose. I've already called manufacturer twice with pens issues and all they even do is go through trouble shooting then tell me the pen is ok to use. The dial does not feel right when I dial the dose and I've even physically marked the pens and I can tell it's not always dispensing the correct dose. I know how long a pen should last and I'm still using the pens with the Baslagar 2-3 days after my pen should be used up. I'm going to beg my dr tomorrow to help me get my insurance to put me back on Lantus not only does the Baslagar pen not work right the drug itself is NOT equal to Lantus no matter what the manufacturer says.",dcgirl1969
1,Basaglar,Diabetes Type 2,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"March 16, 2022",1,"This stuff is less than worthless, it didn't lower my blood sugar a single point at the regular dosage, and when the dose was increased, my blood sugar skyrocketed from 250 to over 400.

3,Basaglar,Diabetes Type 2,2.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"February 3, 2022",0,"Well, my insurance informed me they won't cover Lantus anymore. I will have to go back on Basaglar. My last experience with Basaglar was not positive, I had higher fasting numbers than I did with Lantus. I am expecting the same this time but unlike last time my doctor won't be able to switch me back to Lantus. I am also on Novolog too, so I may have to take more short acting to counter Basaglar. Really unfortunate that insurance makes these decisions based purely on costs, and never weighs the benefits of a certain drug per each patient.",JohnIL

Had a flare up of haemorrhoids and the cream caused a blood sugar spike. After three weeks and the roids still an issue, my dr added Basaglar 40 units. My sugar went higher, I was nauseated, severe fatigue and depression. Took if for three months and no improvement in fact most BG readings are much worse than before Basaglar.  Talking to my dr soon and dropping the Basaglar.  Just did not work for me and made me feel much worse.",Pjj

8,Basaglar,Diabetes Type 2,2.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"April 28, 2021",3,"As with other patients,  the insurance company forced me to use Basaglar in lieu of lantus, side effects are dangerous.  Started having sleepless nights the painful swollen legs and body aches.  Called my dr and he has switched me to treseba.

9,Basaglar,Diabetes Type 2,2.0,,"April 15, 2021",4,"I had always used Lantus for my Type II Diabetes for several years. My new ins company's formulary doesn't cover it.  I contacted Sanofi to get a $99 Rx Savings Card, which I used for 2 refills w/out problems.  This month my Rx request for Lantus was switched over to Basaglar, which is UNACCEPTABLE and unauthorised.  I tried this and it didn't work for me.  I can't deal w/the side effects.  I find it annoying and unconscionable that insurance companies have the audacity to switch patient meds w/out first consulting a patient's physician to make sure that patients won't experience adverse reactions to a change in med.  There shouldn't be able to be doing this.  ""First Do No Harm"" should be their primary focus not their own selfish bottom line..The FDA DOESN'T consider nor did it approve Basaglar as a biosimilar 2 Lantus cuz Lantus wasn't approved under the Public Health Service Act, so there is no reference product for a proposed biosimilar product.",Frustrated-In-WA

I also noticed occasional and always unexplainable perspiration on my face and scalp. After about a month of use, lower leg swelling and shortness of breath was added to my symptoms. Upon calling my doctor, I was advised to ""stick with the Basaglar"" and that it would ""get better."" And so, I tried. Then I began noticing my weight rapidly increasing and rushed to see my doctor in person. He wasn't there, but his PA immediately said that Basaglar is the culprit for all my ills, including the weight gain, and took me off this terrible med. We are now searching for something that will work in its place. The loss of quality of life just wasn't worth the small amount this medication lowered my A1C.",Kate

I have had at least 4 bad pens with the effects others have been describing. Had decent control before moving to Basaglar, then once I switched to another box of pens, sugars went crazy. First one was June 2020 which was accompanied with lower extremity swelling. Had another pen with potency effects in Aug and now I have another. I also had one pen that would not dial at all and was told I had to contact the company. These are not cheap pens by the way! My retail price on a 3 month supply is over $400! Thank goodness my insurance is covering it, but I'm really concerned. I don't feel comfortable taking an unreliable medication that can possibly result in serious complications later!

Also a dull headache and some shoulder pain thats not too bad yet.  As dosage increased ringing gets louder.  However it does work for me and my insurance only covers this brand.

Fine one second almost passed out the next. You feel like you are dying. This happened 3 nights in a row. I had been using it for 10 months up to the scary events. It was not a new pen.

Lantus and Basaglar are the same thing made by different companies. I was so angry because Basaglar does not work I have to take about twice the dosage to get my sugar to budge and it does not stay in my system long at all. I could miss a dose of Lantus and still have a normal blood sugar. They want to push this cheap alternative to please the Insurance Companies.,charles62769

34,Basaglar,Diabetes Type 2,2.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"December 4, 2019",27,Been on both Lantus and now Basaglar and with Lantus alone it controlled my BGL well. With Basaglar I have barely improved my A1C with it and now need Novolog at big meal to even keep my A1C below 8.0. It seems like Basaglar doesnâ€™t do anything to level out the smaller spikes as Lantus did. I have tried different injection sites and nothing helps. I could probably inject saline solution and get better results. The FDA needs to re-evaluate Basaglar because itâ€™s not close to being as effective as Lantus.,illinoistype2

For me, itâ€™s much less effective.  Morning blood glucose is 20-30 points higher; night is 40-50 points higher even with a 10 unit dosage increase.   Basalglar is also 3x dilute, so it requires at least 3x injection volume increase.  The injection pens seem to require more force which causes me to bend needles when I inject in kidney fat pads (canâ€™t inject in belly anymore).   I donâ€™t like Basalglar.",John

I was on Lantus for a year and managed my BGL (blood glucose levels) just fine. I was taking Metformin ER as well. Then I went off Lantus for about a year but my A1C crept up again. I started on Basaglar for the savings in costs. I noticed right away that Basaglar was not as effective at reducing my BGL over time. I ended up using a short acting along with it which added to my overall costs. Not sure in the end its worth the savings if you have to add additional meds to supplement its less effectiveness.,John

I use Basaglar in AM once a day at 30 units.  Haven't tried splitting dose but may try if A1C is not better controlled. Sadly, the costs is a big factor in Basaglar choice over Lantus.",John IL

Aches and pains go along with Insulin trying to get your muscle to accept glucose which is the main reason for the treatment. My only side effect is a tired feeling sometimes. I cannot comment on the dosage accuracy because I have no way to measure this. I have to assume because my fasting numbers are pretty stable the dose must be accurate. If you add carbs certain days because this is long acting insulin its going to affect you days after. This Basaglar seems comparable to Lantus in how it works and the results I get.

Basaglar was their replacement drug of choice sooo here we go.So far about 1 year now and as of today NO Bad Side Effects. My A1Cs are about the same as before and everything appears to be Fine? (Knock on Wood) I have had a Heart Attack recently and required 4 stents to get me up again on my feet. My Cardio team has reviewed my med list and do not think it has any relation to my using Basaglar as opposed to Lantus.I place my trust in my team and will continue to use Basaglar until I am advised against it by my doctors ,have a reaction to it or my insurance decides there is a cheaper alternative?

58,Basaglar,Diabetes Type 2,8.0,Taken for 10 years or more,"September 11, 2018",12,I have been fortunate.  I've been on Lantus or Levemir for approximately 15 years.  Despite its signature burning I use Lantus now because it's more effective.  I find that it doesn't burn if I use a longer needle so that helps.  Because I'm in the Medicare donut hole I've asked my doctor (just today) for a Basaglar rx.  In the past he's given me sample Basaglar pen needles and I've found its effectiveness is identical to Lantus.  I hope the cost will be lower since the donut hole cost right now is almost $300 for the Lantus.  That means I've been relying on my regular insulin for control.,Default LKM

I had a massive headache for two weeks straight although my sugar went from 250 to 152 while using 12u. Then after the first two weeks, my headache went away but my sugar went way back up to the 300s. Went back to the doc and as per their instructions I increased the insulin by 5u every 3 days. At first there was no change. However when I got to 20u the persistent headaches started again, my vision blurred, I started to shake, and I broke out in a cold sweat. I had to leave work early 2 days in a row because I couldn't cope. No pain meds even Hydrocodone would help.

I find that the pen doesn't delivers the amount that I have selected.

Priorly, my HbA1c was 6.2 My glucose level rose from a norm of 109-179 to 154-228. Basaglar did NOT last a full 24 hours. Around hour 10 it seemed to wear off, causing elevated blood glucose levels.  I developed a nagging, dry cough, swollen legs & upper abdomen. My doctor applied for a medical exception with my insurer and CVS to return to Lantus. I have to pay a higher co-pay (Basaglar copay's $30 & Lantus is $50 for a 3 week supply. To get a full month's supply I would have had to pay double that amount) The dry cough has not gone away. Neither has the swelling in my upper abdomen. My blood glucose levels are lower but are no longer under good control as before Basaglar. Very unhappy with the outcome.

Had my daughter not been here to get me food and more glucose tabs, I would probably be in a  coma or have already passed at this point. On the first occasion, I'm aware that I nicked a vein as I pulled the pen back and saw a speck of blood. When I mentioned this to my doctor, she said that couldn't happen because this is a basal insulin. I thought maybe she was right. But it happened this morning. I haven't felt like doing much, but have taken time to read. This DOES act like a fast acting insulin if it gets in your bloodstream. My mom was a diabetic to. She passed last July. The doctors told me her blood sugar got so low her body seized and she went into a coma. I couldn't understand how this happened when my mom had continually high blood sugar. How could it get so low. Now I know. What can be done about this? Even my doctor who prescribed this said it couldn't happen.",Thinton

So I saw a cardiologist and he wants me to do a stress test and I never had an indication of heart problems until taking Basaglar and my sugar readings now tend to increase  throughout the day. My doctor recommended me to take a 2nd dose.. and even after the 2nd dose my sugar tends to increase throughout the day and several times it got as high as 385 by 3:30 p.m. which to me seems unusual so I began testing my sugar levels around 4:30 or 5 p.m. and they were still high.....around 250 or some times higher.   The only thing it does do is lower my sugar at night.   I've had high sugar levels 4 hours after eating lunch around 12:00 12:30 pm - this is something else that is happening.

However, I never actually experienced anything like a ""low"" with Lantus. In fact, it seems to me that Lantus just didn't do much for me at all in terms of lowering blood sugar. Makes no sense unless maybe Lantus really needs to be refrigerated the whole time. The Basaglar pen is easier for me to use because it is just smoother during the injection process for me.",Lauren
