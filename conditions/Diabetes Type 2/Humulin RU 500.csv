0,Humulin RU 500,Diabetes Type 2,1,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"June 29, 2020",3,"Started taking for a new pregnancy for the first time, it worked well for 1 day, the next day my sugars would not reduce well after a meal, and I watch what I eat like a hawk! Low carb, low starch, higher amounts of protein and still it has not worked in 3 weeks, my numbers easily hit 175 after meals and I’ve checked even 4 hours after and it only reduced to the 140s. Not worth the price if it’s not going to work consistently.",Momx2G
1,Humulin RU 500,Diabetes Type 2,4,Taken for 10 years or more,"April 19, 2020",4,"I have been on this insulin for about 3 years.  As with everything it works great at first and then seems to go back to having high blood sugars.  We are going to try the pump next.  I am so insulin resistant that sometimes it can be very depressing.  Right now I take Victoza and Lantus with the Humulin.  With no diet changes my blood sugars have been hitting the 300's.  Unfortunately due to a serious back surgery I can't hardly walk and cannot exercise.  I also experience a weight gain on this insulin, So it's a catch 22.  Take insulin to lower glucose, gain weight so you have to take more insulin, more weight gain.  Yes very disappointing, but not saying this would be ideal for someone else.",Ann
