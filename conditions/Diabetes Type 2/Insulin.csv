1,Insulin,Diabetes Type 2,1.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"June 29, 2020",3,"Humulin R U-500 (Concentrated) (insulin regular):Started taking for a new pregnancy for the first time, it worked well for 1 day, the next day my sugars would not reduce well after a meal, and I watch what I eat like a hawk! Low carb, low starch, higher amounts of protein and still it has not worked in 3 weeks, my numbers easily hit 175 after meals and I’ve checked even 4 hours after and it only reduced to the 140s. Not worth the price if it’s not going to work consistently.",Momx2G
2,Insulin,Diabetes Type 2,4.0,Taken for 10 years or more,"April 19, 2020",4,"Humulin R U-500 (Concentrated) (insulin regular):I have been on this insulin for about 3 years.  As with everything it works great at first and then seems to go back to having high blood sugars.  We are going to try the pump next.  I am so insulin resistant that sometimes it can be very depressing.  Right now I take Victoza and Lantus with the Humulin.  With no diet changes my blood sugars have been hitting the 300's.  Unfortunately due to a serious back surgery I can't hardly walk and cannot exercise.  I also experience a weight gain on this insulin, So it's a catch 22.  Take insulin to lower glucose, gain weight so you have to take more insulin, more weight gain.  Yes very disappointing, but not saying this would be ideal for someone else.",Ann
3,Insulin,Diabetes Type 2,,Taken for 5 to 10 years,"February 8, 2020",7,"Novolin R (insulin regular):Have been using Novolin R for about 10 years now and quite satisfied.  You do want to talk to your doctor about using it, and you may have to adjust your dosage which is true for every type of diabetic product.  It does kick in a little later than other brands, and that is part of the adjustment that may be needed.  Also, your body chemistry, weight, and food consumption will affect dosage..Talk to your Doctor about how to adjust.  The cost savings with this brand is huge...but you need to do some homework",Joey
4,Insulin,Diabetes Type 2,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"December 31, 2019",1,Humulin R U-500 KwikPen (insulin regular):Blood sugar had levelled out at @ 180 taking two other insulins combined 5 times daily. Switched me to concentrated kwikpen. Sugars are swinging between 177 and 390 throughout a 24 hour period. Taking average of 20 more units than sliding scale recommends and still not helping.,Kal-El

An endocronoligist came in to see me and asked if I would like to try Humulin R. I did and my sugar hasn't been high in months. I love it. I am feeling so much better than before.,capillebaking

8,Insulin,Diabetes Type 2,9.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"April 21, 2018",7,"ReliOn/Novolin R (insulin regular):I have used a lot of pills and insulin over the years, but when I switched to Novolin R from Walmart, I had the best A1C tests of all.  I never dropped below 7.3 with the other pills or Humalog or Lantus.  My last two tests were 6.4 and then 5.3.  I  couldn't believe how well it was.  Walmart also charges only $24.88 per vial where as a box of Humlog or Lantus pens was $110 to $120.  The vial is equal to 3.3 pens from a 5 pen box.",jimofNevada
