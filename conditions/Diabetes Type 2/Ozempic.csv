0,Ozempic,Diabetes Type 2,6.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"March 30, 2022",0,I have been on Ozempic since the middle of October 2022. My A1C was 14 + when I first started this journey by the end of November my A1C was 7.2. I thought that this was a miracle drug. December 17th I woke up with severe pain in my left thigh swelling and sensitivity to touch. I thought it was my knee saw surgeon said no and sent me to the back surgeon they said no. After multiple trips to the ER no one could figure out what was wrong with me. I eventually went to a pain management doctor. He sent me to the neurologist who did a nerve study test. And finally diagnosed me a little over a week ago with diabetic amyotrophy- treatment related illness. This is the worst pain of my life. I've had the chest pain and stomach pain the severe pain at night I called them night terror pain because they are so severe that I would wish to die. I am told 1% of diabetics are diagnosed with this disease . It is due to Rapid decline in A1C. I do not know how I got to be a part of the lucky 1%.,Anonymous
1,Ozempic,Diabetes Type 2,6.0,,"March 27, 2022",0,Disappointed for several reasons. The effectiveness was minimal. I always had leftover that I was told I had to waste. I used it for about 8 months. The cost was quite high even with insurance. Ranged between $795 - $3000 but the company offered a savings card that would lower the cost. It started with great savings $25 my cost but each refill the savings card offered less and less savings. I finally refused to refill when they asked me to pay $800 for refill of 3 months.,Becca
2,Ozempic,Diabetes Type 2,9.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"March 27, 2022",0,"I've been on Ozempic for 5 weeks, it was prescribed for type 2 diabetes. I'm extremely sensitive to medications so thankfully it hasn't been too severe. At .25 I had nausea off and on for a couple of days and got sick if I over ate. You fill up so quickly so you have to eat slowly to keep from accidentally overeating. By the end of the 1st month I couldn't tell I was taking it. I just started the 0.5 dose and it's a little intense. I'm having to eat even slower. The 2nd day after the injection I was so sick from having a snack after having my tiny lunch. It was 4 hours after I ate my lunch so I'm assuming it was still sitting in my stomach. My few bites of a snack sent me over the edge into misery. I take an antidepressant and I believe it's behind my original weight gain. I feel it numbs the ability to feel full. I still have a small appetite on Ozempic but I dare not eat. My appetite has been greatly reduced but it's still there. So far 13 pounds are gone in 5 weeks.",Anonymous
3,Ozempic,Diabetes Type 2,1.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"March 26, 2022",2,I haven't read all of the comments but my experience is very different. Since starting on Ozempic I have had the typical side effects mentioned (nausea/constipation) but the most upsetting thing is that I have GAINED almost 20 pounds. I keep taking the medication because the constipation side effect helps me with a gut issue that I've had for years. I wish I would have lost weight and not gained. I've been taking it for 6 months and if my weight keeps going up I will have to stop taking it.,Anonymous
4,Ozempic,Diabetes Type 2,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"March 25, 2022",1,"After 2 injections of .25 started having water diarrhea. On day 3 I woke up and the diarrhea had leaked out and was in my underwear.  Start violently vomiting that same evening. This was day 4 of diarrhea, now with vomiting. My blood sugar levels kept crashing. Rushed to the ER, I had xray, every lab work/panel you can think of, CT scan - nothing. Ozempic is the only culprit.  I am texting this review from my hospital bed. I was admitted and put on fluids and liquid diet. They are trying to keep the nausea under control and stop these symptoms before it affects my kidneys from being dehydrated.  The Ozempic has been thrown in the garbage but I don't know how long the nightnmare from that so called medicine will last.",Anonymous
5,Ozempic,Diabetes Type 2,10.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"March 24, 2022",1,"I have taken Ozempic for a year now.  I suffered through 5 weeks of nausea, but my doctor gave me anti-nausea meds to get through it.  My A1C has stabilized at 5.1, I’ve gotten rid of Metformin, and lost 60 pounds.  If I eat too much, or eat unhealthy foods, I will still get sick.  My weight loss has tapered off, and the negative long term side effect I’ve had is that meat no longer tastes good.  I’ve transitioned to a mostly vegetarian diet.  Occasionally I’ll have a favorite meat meal, but it just doesn’t taste as good, and is liable to make me feel sick afterwards.  I’m fine with this trade off.",Mimi
6,Ozempic,Diabetes Type 2,6.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"March 16, 2022",1,"I started this drug 8 weeks ago. Didn't know what to expect. The first 2 weeks were a nightmare. With  burping sulphur, constant diarrhoea, feeling sick, not able to eat. Its settled after 4 weeks but then increased to .50 dose and symptoms started again. I am loosing weight and diabetes readings are coming down. It's working but dreadful side effects. It does help to eat smaller portions. Will stay on it another while but not sure long term.",Caroline
7,Ozempic,Diabetes Type 2,3.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"March 10, 2022",2,"Newly diagnosed with type 2, started with .25 for 5 weeks. Lots of waves of nausea, headaches and overall discomfort. Week 5 did get better the side effects lasted just a day or two after injection. .5 has been a 2 week nightmare. Extremely painful headaches, nausea and now constipation. I am hoping there's a different med I can try that isn't so hard.",Jules
8,Ozempic,Diabetes Type 2,5.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"March 8, 2022",1,"I have been on Ozempic at the lowest dose for 4 weeks.  The first week was brutal with stomach pain, nausea, vomiting and headache   however I injected the second week in my thigh and the side effects warned.  It appears to be lowering and levelling my A1C.  I'm nervous about increasing my dose next week.  I can manage a week of discomfort as long as it is short term.  My body does seem to be getting used to it.  I'm willing to work with it as long term benefits for me outweigh the short term discomfort.  I may change my mind as time goes on as these horror stories have me concerned.  So strange that there is such a wide range of patient experiences..both good and bad.",Wendy
9,Ozempic,Diabetes Type 2,8.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"March 3, 2022",1,"My doctor recommended Ozempic for my type 2 diabetes. She said it had several benefits over my Metformin,  Glimepiride. I read the reviews and was TERRIFIED to try it. I eventually did and have had no side effects. I have been on it now for 5 weeks. I was started off on .25 and just took my first .5 dose. This is typical of how you start on the medicine. What I learned is that if you are going to go on it, you cannot expect to eat poorly (heavy meals, sugar etc) That is the only time I feel yucky on it. My blood sugars quickly went down and I feel much better. I averaged 145 after a meal, and now it is averaging about 110. I have already been taken off my Glimepiride and the goal is to go off Metformin as well. I have not had a new A1C yet but with my daily numbers, I am confident it will be low. I think those that experienced bad side effects may not have changed their eating habits and instead want the medicine to do all the work. Just my opinion. I am glad I started it.",Itzslp
10,Ozempic,Diabetes Type 2,1.0,,"March 3, 2022",4,"I took .25 for about 6 months and thought this was a miracle drug. Caused slight constipation, but I dealt with it. When they increased me to .5 mg, I started violently vomiting the next day. No one could figure out what was wrong with me. Pancreatic enzymes were high, but not high enough to diagnose pancreatitis. I could barely eat for two months. Gas, bloating, side pain, back pain, stomatitis pain, non-stop burping, constipation, nausea, vomiting off and on. My food perpetually felt like it was backed up into my mouth. They had to take me off of the drug and now my sugars are higher than ever and no one can help me. They were ok before, but now doctors consider me as failing two types of drug classes because of this, won't give me my old meds back, and I may have to go on insulin. I am gaining weight like never before and am so tired that I can barely function. They now believe it gave me gastroparesis and I can't get better. I would recommend this medicine to no one.",Caused gastropa
11,Ozempic,Diabetes Type 2,10.0,,"February 26, 2022",9,"Reading many of the reviews frightened me so I thought it was important to share my positive experience. I’ll first say, I’m horrified of needles. However, you can’t feel the needle at all, the medication going in sort of burns a bit, but that’s it! I’ve been on Ozempic for 5 months. I started at 254 lbs and started taking 0.25mg for 6 weeks. No side effects in the slightest. I also didn’t lose much either though because it is your body getting used to the medication rather than fixing your blood sugars. I then moved up to 0.5 and started seeing results with my weight and still no bad side effects other than eating less. I recently moved up to 1mg and am now down a total of 45 pounds in 5 months. Still no bad side effects. Eating has to be much more mechanical though because my hunger cues aren’t as strong, but no nausea. I would highly recommend this drug! Ps inject in your thighs, I believe this is the reason I’ve had no bad side effects my entire journey!",Anon User
12,Ozempic,Diabetes Type 2,9.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"February 26, 2022",0,"I started Ozempic ten weeks ago on advice from my endocrinologist. I am type 2 diabetic since 2005 and have been taking Metformin and injecting insulin (60 units per day). I was 115 kg when I commenced Ozempic. Prescribed for glucose control (which wasn't real bad at 7.1) but to help weight loss and blood pressure.  I started at 0.25g then 0.5 after four weeks then to 1.0g in week nine. I am already down 6 kg to 109 and blood pressure easing gradually.  I have also reduced my insulin from 60 units to 20 units per day.Side effects have been very mild, some slight constipation immediately after each dose and feeling a little nauseous after eating although smaller portions have helped a lot. Also I eat a couple of small bits of ginger after meals and that is great to stop the nausea feeling.  Ozempic certainly curbs the need for food, particularly fatty or sugary foods.Overall I am very happy so far.",Robert
13,Ozempic,Diabetes Type 2,3.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"February 25, 2022",0,"I started on 0.25 of Ozempic and after a month, increased to 0.50. After 2 months, I had lost 20 lbs. (I was not overweight). I constantly felt nauseous, had no appetite for anything, finally vomiting at random times whether I had eaten or not. Would take a laxative suppository every week because I had no urge ever to go. It did lower my AIC, but wasn't worth the effects. Med has been changed.",Grace

My insurance made it so expensive I had to stop.  I started again  3 days ago on .25.  so far no side effects. If you drink your water throughout the day you may have less nausea.  I haven't been on the scale yet but I'll keep you posted.. your food intake will be cut in half!!! My starting weight on Friday was 305!

15,Ozempic,Diabetes Type 2,3.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"February 16, 2022",1,"I started with .25 mg about five months ago, working up to 1 mg about three months ago.  I honestly can't remember any notable side-affects for the first four months.  Unfortunately, after I took my last 1 mg dose, I almost immediately became nauseous and bloated.  I could only eat small amounts of food before feeling like I was going to explode.  It's obvious why a lot of people lose weight on this drug;  it CAN make you feel like rubbish.  I'm just not sure I can feel this horrible every single day for it's benefits.",bloatedinCO

I only managed to tolerate the higher 1mg dose for 3 weeks before I ended up in the emergency dept with pancreatitis. My consultant stopped the medication and 3 weeks later I’m slowly getting better. But continue to have gastric issues and dizziness. You really need to be careful with this drug and weigh up the risks. It took a heavy toll on my health with moderate slow weight loss.

Started with a .25 dose, then a .5 dose and this week started a 1.0 dose and throughout taking Ozempic, and before it, I also take Xigduo. I feel sick, nauseated, disgusted by food and smells of food, and more recently extreme gas at both ends...both smell like rotting garbage or sulfur. Nothing helps with any symptoms. Gas reliever just means more gas and vomit burps. I have diarrhea regularly. My count is down to 6.9, but what is the point of taking something that clearly hinders my enjoyment of life. I'm really NOT bagging on this drug, it does what is supposed to, but I wish there were a way to stop the side effects. If anyone has ideas, please share!",Pomchi Gal

I did experience very mild nausea at first but I paid attention to my body and just ate less. I have experienced some constipation and have taken over the counter medication for that. I have lost just under 4 pounds a month for the last 5 months. I need about 30 percent less insulin. My appetite has decreased. I eat less at meals and rarely snack. My A1c is under 7.

It was kind of ok lets say it with side effects with 0.25 and 0.5 but when I got to 1ml I felt horrible. Dizzy, stomach aces, vomiting, horrific. And I lost maybe 1.5 kg in 2.5 months so in my opinion not worth it. I am going to go back on my meds for diabetes, eat healthier and go back to gym.

26,Ozempic,Diabetes Type 2,1.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"January 1, 2022",5,"If you have any form of stomach or bowel disorder or a history of pancreatitis, you may want to steer clear of Ozempic or any of the other similar drugs in it’s class.  They slow gastric emptying, which can really get your system out of order and wreak havoc.  If you start having sulfur burps, extreme nausea, horrific vomiting and diarrhea, you’ll know it isn’t for you.  For me, it got so bad, I was having to resort to wearing adult diapers.   I initially thought I was having episodes of food poisoning or giardiasis, but turned out to be medicine-induced gastroparesis & pancreatitis.  Ozempic and the drugs like it may work great in some people, but be downright dangerous in others.  Use with caution and pay attention to the warning signs.

27,Ozempic,Diabetes Type 2,1.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"December 29, 2021",0,"I was started on a 30 day trial of Ozempic at the same time I was started on Metformin. Everything went ok for the first couple of weeks- although I did notice a slight headache the day I took my dose of Ozempic. Then right at the time I stepped up my dose per the trial instructions, I started getting violently ill. They had me stop both medications and start 1 back at a time and it was determined I can't tolerate Metformin. After trying Jardiance and only getting small results, they started me back on Ozempic. I was sick within 2 days of my first dose. My stomach WOULD NOT digest any vegetables- which sort of defeats the purpose of taking it for blood sugar management when all you can tolerate are simple carbs. After the 2nd dose, I decided I was spending too much time trying not to be violently ill after eating and asked to be taken off the medication. Thankfully, since I was only 2 weeks in, I was able to notice a decrease in symptoms within a week of stopping. Not for me.",KEW

I began taking Ozempic- I was very sick. It made me extremely nauseous- I got severe diarrhea, but let me tell you- I lost 17 pounds of water weight in ONE month. My dr couldn’t believe it. In four months, I lost 40 lbs. the nausea was mild to severe the entire time, but the results were borderline insane. It reset my metabolism, took ALL of the inflammation away from my joints, neck, back, my feet completely healed within one month. It’s barely believable.

34,Ozempic,Diabetes Type 2,8.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"December 12, 2021",0,Doctor asked me if I wanted to switch from my weekly injection of Trulicity (been on Trulicity for over 4 years) and try Ozempic. He said that Ozempic was more effective. I agreed to try it. He asked if I wanted to start on a low .5 mg dose because of the adverse side affects that some people experience with their digestive system / stomach. I told him I have a pretty strong stomach and eat a lot of spicy / hot food so I'd go for the full 1mg dose.Started it on a Sunday (2 weeks ago) and my stomach did feel kinda lousy for the first 3 or 4 days. Pretty much went away after that though.I have been accustomed to giving myself a moderate dose of Novolog (16-20 mg depending on how high my blood glucose is) without eating anything when I check my glucose level. That has always worked well for me to bring my glucose down from say 220 to around 120 or 130.With Ozempic doing that will cause my glucose to crash. to 60 or 70.,Brian

I read how people were sick so limited breakfast to one biscuit, lunch to 2 eggs, and dinner to a chicken breast. I did not get sick but the bloating burning sensation lasted 5 days. I had oatmeal for breakfast the next two days, with a wrap for lunch and dinner. It only curbed my appetite by making me scared to death to eat, which caused constipation. My blood sugars were slightly lower, the the fear of getting sick was not work it for me. I also have GERD and took pepcid two days. I have been diabetic a long time, almost 23 years. I take insulin.

Managed it by a very low carb diet 30g Max per meal- for 20 years. BMI on the normal border. Then I hit 45 and early menopause. Sugar levels rose. gained 25 lbs. They put me on Metformin. Big mistake, it RUINED my stomach. Can't process lactose or fructose after that fiasco and I developed IBS!  Be careful of Metformin!Finally put on Ozempic. On it since Feb 2021. The first three months we rough. Major nausea, especially after a dosage adjustment. I lived on ginger pills. Constipation  but I had IBS so that was not unusual by then. I went up to 1ml and two weeks later it paid off. Symptoms went away, I lost 28 lbs and both sugar and cholesterol are NORMAL. Now I can actually eat, for the first time since early 20s, a full measured cup of pasta and not get ill. Doc wants to wean me off...

87,Ozempic,Diabetes Type 2,5.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"August 18, 2021",2,"Started with 4 weeks of .25mg  injections and have now had two .5 injections.  Was administering the injection at noon on Sundays.  Each time, I'd start feeling queasy and burp-y after about 24 hours.  I'd feel like I was on the verge of throwing up, but for the most part would keep it down. Then on Monday of this week (after my 2nd .50 dose), like clockwork, I started feeling queasy.  But this time it was a much stronger sensation, until the point that I projectile vomited about 5 times.  After that was over, I felt better - UNTIL about 5 hours later, when the process repeated itself.  I think it was likely due to the fact that I had some pizza and a cherry coke that day, which was a stupid thing for me to do.  So anyway, I hadn't eaten anything in 48 hours besides some cantaloupe, and now I'm experiencing a mild nausea.

172,Ozempic,Diabetes Type 2,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"February 2, 2021",80,"I feel that the best practice for this medicine would be to take about only 8-10 clicks (17 clicks = 0.25) for the first several weeks and then build yourself up to the full 0.25 dose.  That way you can see what side effects you are going to experience and if they are tolerable of not.  I took 0.25 and suffered from severe diarrhea for almost the full 7 days. Ended up in the hospital for the last 4 days until the side effects wore off. The only positive, was that I lost almost 20lbs. I would be very careful taking this medicine.",SH

My doctor wants me to stick with it, saying that these side effects usually improve, but It's been pretty miserable. I'm thinking I'm going to stop taking it.

My weight had  been creeping up due to insulin resistance (which itself makes it harder to lose weight) and PCOS. My doctor recommended I try this in conjunction with a very low carb and calorie diet. I started with a half dose of 0.25mg once a week injection and then after 2 weeks up to 0.5mg a week and so far in 6 weeks I’ve lost 15cm from my waist and 9cm off my hips, 5cm off my bust. I have been eating lite and easy roughly 1000 calories a day. Haven’t weighed myself yet as I’d prefer to see the difference in cm. This medication makes me feel a little nauseous the first day or two after my shot but after that I never feel hungry. I can quite easily eat a super small portion and feel full! I drink about 2L of water a day and do about 8000 steps at my job. It really has been great and sooooo much cheaper than Saxenda which was another one I was considering.

At the time I started Ozempic, I'd brought my blood sugar down to what would translate to an A1C of 5.5 or so, and I'd managed to kick most of the insulin I was on. I started Ozempic at 0.25 units per week and had mild nausea and diarrhea, but my appetite vanished and I could barely bring myself to eat. Once I started the full dose, my blood sugars began to climb rapidly. I'd be fine in the mornings at first and then experience wild spikes between meals, until finally my fasting sugar started to climb out of my desired range. I actually had to take MORE insulin, not less, just to keep my fasting BG below 7.

I take my shot every Sunday .25 the day after I take the shot I do experience some nausea headaches & constipation but it’s only for 1 day but it’s worth it for these low numbers. I was scared to take this new drug because I already take metformin 1000mg once a day but I’m so happy my dr introduced me to this medicine. If you guys can get through the side effects keep taking it this medicine really works",Anonymous

260,Ozempic,Diabetes Type 2,6.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"February 6, 2020",18,So I have been on Ozempic for 5 weeks. I am tired a lot. Not sure if this is the drug or my poor sleep but now that I see others are tired a lot it makes me wonder. I have nasty burps a lot. I started on a dose of .25 for 4 weeks. I had a lot of low level nausea but not too bad except for one day. Then last Sunday I took  the higher dose of .5 and I was okay on Sunday and Monday but Tuesday the nausea was horrible and I had explosive diarrhea all day to the point I had to take immodium and I got my Dr.'s office to prescribe an anti-nausea med  Zofran which helped a little. The next day less nausea and today is Thursday of that week and I still have the burps and more BM's than I would like as well as a lot of gas. I know I have lost weight just by how my clothes fit. I have very little appetite. Not sure if the pluses outweigh the minuses yet. I am probably gonna try one more week and see how I feel. It has had a modest impact on blood sugars. I have been using less insulin.,Ed
261,Ozempic,Diabetes Type 2,5.0,,"February 4, 2020",15,"This medication effectively lowered my blood sugar, which had previously been VERY high.  However, the side effects were intolerable.  I took it for eight weeks and experienced the following:  spontaneous vomiting multiple times per day, constant nausea, uncontrollable burping, which might surprise you as a small vomit (and I've never been a person that burps), and an aversion to food.  I lost weight on my arms and legs.  The last week I was on it, I went four days without eating (I threw up the little amount of food that I could bring myself to eat).  I was light headed and dizzy.  I BEGGED my doctor for something different.  She switched me to Victoza and 1 week in, there has been a huge change.  The nausea is gone.  I have thrown up a few times, but it is nothing like Ozempic.  The burping is greatly reduced. ",Anonymous

I've dropped about 30 lbs and counting, my A1C is now in the prediabetic range and I've been able to lower doses of other medications that were causing significant side effects.

The only side effect I get is diarrhea and stomach cramps (mainly gas buildup) 12-48 hours after taking it. On occasion I will get nauseated,  I have stayed on .25 and never increasing. So far I like this drug and those side effects are manageable. As long as I'm near a toilet the first 48 hours just in case.",Snake

Ended up in ER with mild pancreatic attack & high lipase levels. I've had no desire to eat or even drink water. It makes me gag & I used to drink a lot of water. I'm done with these injections. I will stay on my metformin but I can do better on a healthy eating lifestyle than on Ozempic & all the negative side effects. Quality of life has went from a 10 to 1 & that is not me.

I was on metformin, but found my A1C increasing, so was recommended that I try this. I have had no problems with nausea, vomiting, diarrhea or stomach pains etc. that others have had.   I have lost 26lbs and am using 1ml per week. I started with the .25, after two weeks increased to .5 and then after 4 weeks increased to 1ml. My daily blood test has decreased down from around 10-11 to 4.5-6 and my A1C reduced down from 11 down to 8, that was 2 months ago. I will redo next month. I truly think it will be down under 7 when I do it. For me it is the miracle drug, I feel so much better and with the weight loss I feel less tired. I am sure it does not work for everyone, but for those it does, it is a very good product.  I did have to get approval through my endocrinologist for my drug plan to cover this.

Very minimal side effects - occasional diarrhea, some gas and belching. Nothing I couldn't handle. The fourth week of .25mg was worse. Constant diarrhea for four days, nausea, some vomiting. I went to a different doctor thinking I had a stomach virus, he prescribed me an anti-diarrheal and I felt better.I took the Ozempic at .5mg then, as prescribed. Two days later, nightmare. Diarrhea again, vomiting, nausea, and serious fatigue.

I have lost some weight (about 7lbs), which with hip surgery, its rough to get out. The cravings are strange.  As one said, sugary things in the evening. I have taken care of that and eat my vegies or pop open a V8.  Believe me, a V8 will curb about any craving.  You do have to force yourself to drink water. Extremely important. Coke Zero cravings are completely gone. I still have one in a great eon.  Food appetite is down. I do take more naps than usual, but I believe that is from the reduced food intake.

I woke the 2nd day with extreme bloat, diarrhea, nausea and abdominal pain. I could not eat or drink a thing because of severe bloating. This lasted 5 days. Foolishly I did a 2nd dose the next week of .25mg. This time I became much, much sicker with the same symptoms but more severe. Abdominal pain severe, bloating was so bad I had to go to the ER my stomach was as tight as a drum. They were talking about sticking a tube in my stomach to release the incredible pressure, instead I came home and rolled around in agony for 3 days. I stopped using it but the side effects continued. 7 weeks of severe gastroenteritis that caused so much inflammation in my body I have been in so much pain. No amount of weight loss is worth this level of suffering. If you have any GI issues like gastroparesis, you really should not be risking it with this drug, it says so right in the insert.",macandrea
486,Ozempic,Diabetes Type 2,2.0,,"October 17, 2018",9,I been taking ozempic for three weeks at the low dose. It is not helping I never run very high sugars unless I eat a big meal. Now eating or not I can’t seem to get under a1c 150. It don’t seem to help me I also am always hungry now before this Med I was losing weight now I’m gaining. Not very happy with it. Doctors say I should see improvement when I up my insulin amount after 4 weeks. We will see than if it works. All I know is I don’t want to keep damaging the body with high sugars when I was doing fairly well before taking this.,Mhawks

493,Ozempic,Diabetes Type 2,2.0,,"August 30, 2018",30,"I started Orzempic and had no issue with the initial dose of .25. When I had the second dose, I had minor nausea and definitely noticed not feeling as hungry. 5 days later, I had severe diarrhea and very foul-tasting burping. The next day, I was ok. Then the following day, I had diarrhea again. I thought maybe stomach virus. Imodium helped me get through the rest of the day. Then it was the day I take my shot (Sunday night.) Monday was ok, and then it started again with the terrible tasting burps, severe diarrhea and nausea, vomiting. I was unable to eat anything except ice chips. The diarrhea has continued for now the third day. I literally can’t be more than 10 steps from the bathroom. I’ve only had water, chicken broth, 1 banana, 1/2 cup applesauce, 1/2 cup plain rice, and 1 cup apple juice and still can’t stay away from the bathroom.

I would say that I experience mild nausea for a day or so, but it's very minor and manageable. My blood sugar is normal now and I have slowly been losing weight (5 lbs so far). My appetite is definitely suppressed and I feel very full after small meal portions. The injection is so easy and pain free. I am quite pleased with this drug so far.",IanCredible
495,Ozempic,Diabetes Type 2,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"August 23, 2018",169,"I have been on Ozempic for 2.5 weeks now and I have lost 12 pounds. I don’t eat anything fried or greasy. I watch fat intake because this medicine can make you sick if you have too much fat in what you are eating. It can also make you sick if you overeat. If you eat small - moderate meals with light snacks in between, you will probably not have any problems. If you cannot stay away from fast food and greasy pizza, you will have a problem. I have found that this medicine makes me not as hungry. It takes the edge off. It also keeps me from craving junk. I get full at meal time, eating less. I drink a lot of water too. I also use an app on my phone to log food, calories and exercise. I weigh once a week. I hope this helps someone else that is considering this drug.",Kristy

However 5 days in, the diarrhea hit. It has been absolutely horrendous. The gurgling sounds can be heard from across a huge room. I have woken up to bowel leakage and been running to the bathroom about 10 times a day for the last 3 days. Then there’s belching which is worse than a typical burp. It’s happening regularly too. I’m really sad and afraid. I really thought this was going to help me bring down my A1c. But I don’t see how I can continue taking it. I’m calling my endo tomorrow. I need something to work but these side effects are just not livable. Especially because I work in a corporate atmosphere.",Sally
500,Ozempic,Diabetes Type 2,8.0,,"June 27, 2018",23,"I've been taking this for 2.5 months. I've lost a solid 10 pounds. I take it right before bed so I can sleep off the initial side effects, if any. There  is little bit of diarrhea, nothing too crazy. I have major loss of appetite, I can eat half meals or half kids meal and always full after few bites. Sugars are low. The major side effect is nausea but it isn't every day. I've thrown up 3 times within the past 3 months which is something I never did prior. It comes out of no where and honestly I'm unsure if it is this injectable or just from taking iron supplement and vitamin. Could be the vitamin. I feel tired also, not sure if it's just work or a side effect. Overall I'm happy with the injectable plus it beats taking a pill every day.",Thickerthanasnicker

My side effects from Ozempic are awful. Two to three days after a weekly dose I experienced severe diarrhea, gas, belching, nausea, lasting about 24 hours.

504,Ozempic,Diabetes Type 2,5.0,,"May 17, 2018",13,"Initially began Ozempic  0.25mg for 4 weeks.  Side effects were tiredness, constipation.  My fasting blood sugar numbers were lower in the morning.  When I began the 0.50mg dose @5 weeks, I had nausea, dizziness, and lethargy the day following first dose.  The second day following that dose I felt about 70% better. With the 2nd dose of 0.50mg side effects were less severe, some minor nausea, headaches and the tiredness continued.  I hope that these side effects disappear.  I plan to take this medication until I get my 3-month labs, and I expect that my A1c will be down significantly.  It was at 5.9 in July of 2017. Due to the stress of caring for a dying relative Sept. through Dec. it jumped to 9.3.  At my next appt my doctor suggested I try Ozempic in combination with Metformin 500mg @2x/day.  I received a 3-mo. discount card and have not yet checked with my health insurance provider to see if it will be covered. I am an active 61 year old female but type two diabetes does run in my mother’s family.",Hoot
