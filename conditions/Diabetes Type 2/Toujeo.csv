0,Toujeo,Diabetes Type 2,2.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"November 9, 2021",0,"I started taking Toujeo in April 2021. My first reaction to the drug was joint pain and swelling in my calves, ankles and knee's. My calves looked like giant (chicken) drum stick. This insulin has interacted with my Blood pressure medications where I have developed Edema. Dependent edema is what I was diagnosed with. My insulin has recently been changed to Levemir. I've  only been on the new insulin for a couple of days. How long does it take before the new drug (insulin) takes effect? My balance is off, my legs are heavy to move to the point where I am dragging my feet when I walk, and this scares me.",Stella

2,Toujeo,Diabetes Type 2,1.0,,"July 27, 2021",0,"Just opened a box of five pens, four of which are not working. Found out the hard way, after piercing myself. The quality of these things is shocking. Incidentally, this box is a free replacement from the pharmacy for a previous set of malfunctioning pens.I will not recommend this product.",wr100m

4,Toujeo,Diabetes Type 2,2.0,,"April 11, 2021",4,"I found this to be great at first, but like viktosa after 4 weeks of using my body reacted to it horribly.I started rotten egg burps which is a build up sulphur dioxide because food was now passing slower through digestive system, this would cause me to vomit rotten smelling food.The other side effect was feeling extremely tired and nauseous, chronic diarrhea which lasted for over a week,  which in conjunction with the diarrhea caused a few accidents which was embarrassing at work as it would happen anytime.It made me scared to eat anything, my stomach became bloated within minutes of the injection, this was supposed to be a weekly dose for me. I stopped taking it for 3 weeks ago and all my symptoms went away, I then wanted to be sure this medication was the cause of my issues and I hadn't caught some other virus.So I took it on Thursday 8th April 2021 by Friday afternoon and all over the weekend my symptoms returned making me feel so unwell.So I won't be taking this anymore.",Wren
5,Toujeo,Diabetes Type 2,9.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"December 17, 2020",12,I have taken Toujeo for over a year. A1C down 1.5 points. I gained weight the first three months but levelled off. I take 60 units each morning. Also metfomin 2000 mg a day. No bad side effects. Regulates my glucose readings. Very few plus 200. Usually 90-155. Iâ€™ll take it. I exercise three days a week but nothing Herculean. My diet is pretty low carb but Toujeo allows for a little cheating. My dose continues to be okay for now. Thought this might encourage a few to give it a try.,Birdman
6,Toujeo,Diabetes Type 2,1.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"December 30, 2019",15,Been on Toujeo for about 4 yrs now. I am taking 290 units of this insulin and my numbers are still very high. 14-18 is pretty average. I feel I am taking way too much and the more I take the less effective it is becoming.,AT
7,Toujeo,Diabetes Type 2,3.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"August 5, 2019",13,Toujeo used to work for me. Was on lantus until my work removed it from the formulary. Toujeo lately has refused to lower my sugars even if I have been fasting for 16 hours.,Fedup
8,Toujeo,Diabetes Type 2,10.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"April 17, 2019",11,"I am Type 2 diabetic patient for almost 4 years. I used metformin and sitagliptin tablets but my A1C was always higher than 7.6 or even 8. I also had acute pancreatitis from Sitaglptin. My doctor prescribed me  Toujeo SoloStar with metformin which improved my results but after meal blood sugar was still high. The doctor added NovoRapid insulin with the meals. Now my A1C is 5.6 and fasting glucose is below 7.2 , very satisfied with my medication.",DrRaouf
9,Toujeo,Diabetes Type 2,2.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"March 18, 2019",11,"Have been on toujeo for over 2 years, taking 80 units at bedtime.  Like the other reviewer, djricci, the toujeo has caused  a rash to break out all over my body, especially on lower legs and scalp.  The overall constant itching is driving me nuts.  Results have been so-so, I am lucky if sugar is below 200 in the AM.  Have also experienced some of the side effects others have noted (blurry vision, weight gain, dizziness).",klreinckeAOL
10,Toujeo,Diabetes Type 2,3.0,,"January 18, 2018",16,"I started this medicine a year ago.  I take 15 units before bed plus 2 Metformin pills a day.  At first, I was getting fantastic results.  Waking blood sugar every morning was under 100 and no side effects.  Now, a year later, I have an itchy, scaly rash on my right side that will not go away, waking blood sugars are all over the place ranging from the 180's to the 280's, blurry vision, and tiredness.  I've had no changes in diet or exercise and I'm not overweight.   It's as if the drug just stopped working altogether.  I am requesting my doctor take me off this and try something else.",satsas
11,Toujeo,Diabetes Type 2,,Taken for less than 1 month,"October 30, 2017",25,"About 1 1/2 weeks into using Toujeo, 50 units at night, I started having rapid heartbeat and constant extra/skipped heartbeats. Dr said Toujeo could NOT cause that.  Wore a halter monitor for 3 days. My Dr. asked me if I had always had an ""irregular heartbeat.""  Hello??  No Dr. ever told me that and I never had one.  You'd think my Dr. might know that?  However, my nutritionist looked it up on her computer and said, ""Oh, I'm sorry to tell you this, but irregular heartbeat is one of the most common side effects of Toujeo.""  I looked it up myself and sure enough...there it was.  I stopped on my own...about 3 weeks later heartbeat slowly returned to normal.  Toujeo caused??? YES, I think so.",Sugar pie

13,Toujeo,Diabetes Type 2,9.0,,"February 12, 2017",8,"Toujeo Solostar was a vast improvement over the old insulin, the best part is the needles. The only thing that sucks, province of Ontario does not approve it. I wish they would get their act together. I am a senior and I have to pay for this type of insulin. I may have to change back to the old insulin soon unless Ontario Government approves it.",gudnason

I am now on 30 units after increasing over 4 month period.  I am beginning to see some improvement but I am going to increase some more.  I have used Novolog with better results.

18,Toujeo,Diabetes Type 2,9.0,,"July 18, 2016",11,"When my doctor first put me on this I didn't like it. My sugars went up, but since I have been on it for awhile now, my a1c numbers have come down and my sugars numbers in the morning have also come down. Here lately they have been around 145 and in the afternoon they are around 106. I am impressed with toujeo so far.",Rebaf

The longer you have it the harder it is to control. I have noticed new things that haven't gone away. One eye is blurry, sometimes both of them. I have convultions in my boby that drive me crazy. It's not fun to have your body jumping around. I have also been having cold sweats, dizziness & headache. I am going to go back to Lantus.It took me awhile to realize these symptoms were not normal to my other illnessess. But I am sure now.",mother nature

21,Toujeo,Diabetes Type 2,9.0,,"May 2, 2016",12,Getting better results than with Lantus.  Used Lantus for 7 years.  I have used Toujeo for 1 year as of April 2016.  Did not experience any adverse side effects.  Blood sugar much more stable - not as many highs or lows.  Makes it easier to do fine-tuning with my mealtime insulin.  A1c came down and stayed between 6 and 6.3.,BillSaavy

But, my sugars have been all over the place.  I have had 350 highs and 74 lows, up and down, with no real reason.  For example, two nights ago, my bedtime reading was 114 and the next morning, without eating anything, my reading was 353!!  No reason.  Anyone else having this issue with Toujeo?

On Toujeo and Humalog,the sugars are in the 200's. I'm at my wits end.
