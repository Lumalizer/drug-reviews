My fasting stick numbers are relatively stable but way above target. They became high after my first COVID 19 vaccine last March. My Dr. Increased my dosage of Glimepiride from 1 to 4 mg first, then added this in January. I experience both bowel & bladder incontinence due to chronic degenerative osteoarthritis that generates untreatable pain. I use to be functional. Then, the CDC reclassified Hydrocodone to a type 2 narcotic. And left me and millions of others to suffer. Most people who take this pain reliever never become addicts. Just become non- working disabled.",Chuck
1,Dapagliflozin,Diabetes Type 2,10.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"September 23, 2021",1,"Farxiga (dapagliflozin):I started out taking Trulicity once a week with Trajenta once a day.  Loved my low A1c which came down to 5.8 without much work on my part.  However, I developed gastroparesis.  Although Trulicity is awesome with once a week injection (not insulin), the symptoms with gastroparesis were just too much.  Anyway my endo put me on Xigduo (Farxiga 5 mg / 1000 mg metformin combo) in July 2020.  My A1c started creeping up to 6.8.  I wasn't happy with that so she added another 5 mg of Farxiga to be taken with Xigduo.  I have been doing great.  A1c is down to 6.0 and I've lost 20 pounds since January 2021 without really any work on my part.  Believe me I am not the perfect diabetic either.  I have always drank tons of water so peeing all the time has always been part of my life.  Plus I have no more gastroparesis symptoms.",bluehens

It worked at first to keep my AIC in check but soon I started having an increase in appetite picking up 5lbs. My fasting started to increase because I was doing late nite snacking.I was on Metformin XR  2000 before they did the recall, which worked well for me.

4,Dapagliflozin,Diabetes Type 2,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"August 6, 2021",0,So daughter is 25yrs old with Down Syndrome. A few weeks after her 2nd covid vaccine her sugar levels went from being normal to the high 20’s. GP put her on dapagliflozin but the following day she was peeing blood!!!Got a urine sample to the GP and they said there was blood and infection in it so have sent it away for further testing. 3 days later daughter developed thrush and cystitis. In an awful state and in a lot of pain!!!I told the GP initially that I didn’t want my daughter on this tablet because of the side effects but he insisted!!!Now I’ve had a week of her being really poorly and it’s messed up her kidneys so she’s on 2 different antibiotics and fluconazole for thrush!!!I have no faith in GP prescribing for diabetes especially in our surgery. My daughter is special needs and has lots of other medical conditions and even the local 2 pharmacists are useless!!!!!!!,Lehel

I’m writing this to encourage people to educate themselves on what DKA is and the signs. My blood sugar was only 7 when I first went to the ER, and by the time I was being flown out, it had climbed to over 40. Signs for me we’re sudden onset weakness and shortness of breath, nausea, vomiting, severe headache and muscle pain, loss of appetite leading to extreme breathing problems (kussmal breathing) and finally unconsciousness.

Hoping taking Bydureon again will have the great effects in controlling blood sugar as before. Had to go off Bydureon in the past due to insurance denial and cost. Doctor gave me a savings card to bypass the ""bull"" and outrageous cost from the insurance company. Too bad the insurance companies are only out for the money and not the health of people.
