I didn't lose any additional weight but it did seem to lower sugar. However, after taking this for about a year, I started getting a yeast infection. I NEVER get them. I tried everything. Prescription meds, creams, suppositories. Nothing worked to get rid of it. I was blistering, peeling, and bleeding. I also had a pretty constant UTI. I even used moist wipes per the doctor's order from day one to keep extra clean. At first I thought it could be those so I changed brands and even went to the ultra sensitive ones. Then I thought to check here and I'm so glad I did! After realizing it could be Jardiance, I went off of it and the infections stopped on their own with no other intervention! My doc tried to start again with lower dose but as soon as I started getting the first sign of infections coming back, I ditched it. Waiting on an appointment with an endo to see what's next.",Sha

The only side effect I had was a couple yeast infections at the very beginning.  My blood sugars are pretty good and my A1c is 6.3 but that was never a problem.  I have also lost 35lbs without changing my diet or any real exercise besides short walks that I always did.  I am really questioning why my previous doctor never put me on any thing besides metformin when I complained about high blood sugars for YEARS!  He said, ""Oh, your A1C is fine so it's fine to have blood sugars of 250. ""  I think maybe he shouldn't be a doctor.  Anyway.  Jardiance seems to be a good medication for me at least.  I take 25mg once a day in a pill form.  Take care out there fellow diabetics.",Justinerachel1

I developed body aches at the highest level I've ever experienced in my life!  Next my neck area swelled up and there were giant softball sized lumps on either side of my lower neck area.  I developed a huge rash that looked like a yeast infection all over my groin area. I went to the ER where I was diagnosed with stage 4 ketoacidosis and the doctor told my family I had only 4 hours left to live! In ICU, the doctor put me on insulin and I began to improve and spent an additional 2 weeks in the hospital with pneumonia.  The side effects of Jardiance are so life threatening, I will not ever take this medication again, it's just not worth it and my blood glucose numbers didn't improve enough to justify the risk factors.",Sing More

Started at 10 mg a year ago, moved to higher dose shortly after beginning.  Was all good for the last year.  3 weeks ago I developed a sore spot beneath my scrotum on a Tuesday, by Friday I was in ER in need of life saving surgery to remove infection from Fournier's gangrene.  They told me if I was not as healthy as I am and waited the weekend to see primary care Dr... I would have died from septic shock.  The ER docs diagnosed in 20 mins, said it not rare and Jardiance was the cause.  Fourniers gangrene has a 20 to 50% mortality rate, not a word about it from primary care.  ER and surgical team says they see at least a case per week.  This drug and the 3 other brands that work similarly are very dangerous.  Diabetes is a money maker, they make more money when we are sick.  Drug companies and doctors have lawyers protecting them......nobody but ER doctors, surgeons and nurses protect the patient once the damage is done.  Get off these drugs.",Lance

I have at various times been on Invokana, Invokamet, and Farxiga, and despite my resevations, now Jardiance.  I could only take it for less than a week before deciding this was absolutely not for me.  I had to pee at least once hourly and sometimes 2 or 3 times in an hour. This was extremely disruptive at work and when trying to drive any distance at all.  It seemed that every time I emptied my bladder within an hour or less I would have to go again. This also occurred at night and resulted in extreme day time fatigue. The urgency would be so extreme that I would dribble in my clothes before making it to the bathroom. It seemed that I could not drink enough water.  There was only a very modest lowering noted with my fingersticks blood sugar tests. The end for me was frequent episodes of lightheadedness so extreme that I thought I would faint. This occurred while sitting, standing, walking and driving. This was the last straw, never again.

But then I get this urge to go to the bathroom to urinate and when I get there I can’t go. I want to my doctor today and he gave me medicine for a yeast infection. If this is what’s causing me to be so excessively tired and painful I got to get off it because I cannot function like this. I feel like I’ve been hit by a Mack truck.

I was taken off that and now I've been on Jardiance for a week now at a dose of 10mg once a day. I am very spooked by the reviews and more than likely will request to be switched to metformin extended release hoping I can stomach that. The only side I have so far is being constantly light headed. I tried to workout with it and I ended having to sit every few minutes from being light headed so I am stopping the Jardiance for now. My starting blood sugar was about 280 and is now 180-200 fasting. I haven't weighed myself cause its not the reason I'm taking it. My main focus now is coming off blood sugar medication as a whole. But that is all for now. The lightheadedness sucks. Its better than nausea and vomiting but it still sucks. If any changes I'll share more.",Juicy

The key I think is being very low carb to begin with. You can't take this drug and eat a SAD diet full of carbs. Carbs will just raise your blood sugars and spike insulin which will result in the medication making you pee more and more to get rid of it. All that sugar pee will just result in yeast infections.

273,Empagliflozin,Diabetes Type 2,1.0,,"August 22, 2015",36,"Jardiance (empagliflozin):Terrible drug.   Made me pee every 90 mins, which is not good as I am  a driver on the road all day.  Constant back pain.  Having to get to 2/3 times during the night to go to toilet, causing lack of sleep.      Negatives far outweigh positives.  I stopped taking it after 3 months.",Little Lofty

I normally drink a lot ofwater but have noticed a definite increase in frequency of urination as well as urgency.This I can live with as I have ""failed"" 4 other diabetic medications. Have not noticedmuch weight loss but I am only about 10lbs overweight anyway. Keeping fingers crossed with this medication.  I am not taking any other diabetic medication and was able to control with diet and exercise for a number of years.  But this is a progressive disease.  No other side effects noted.",siji
275,Empagliflozin,Diabetes Type 2,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"August 1, 2015",41,"Jardiance (empagliflozin):My 37 year old son is a Type I diabetic-totally insulin dependent. His endocrinologist put him on 10mg Jardiance last Saturday. We were initially impressed that his sugar readings were better but Wednesday night he started vomiting uncontrollably and in severe pain all over. We rushed him to hospital. His kidneys were not functioning. He went from ER to ICU with keto acidosis.. I read all over the internet that this medication is NOT for Type I diabetics. When we called the doctor,he blamed his condition on SCUBA diving which is ridiculous. We always SCUBA and he has never had a problem as he monitors his diabetes carefully. He got sick hours after SCUBA diving. ICU kidney specialist said he should never had been put on this medicine.",Mom of Ben

I'm going into month 3 and I'm not sure this is reducing my sugar enough. Big issues with various infections, like 5 in the past 2 months. It does also seem to CAUSE sugar cravings, as the last reviewer mentioned.",phoenixrising513

I have lost 42 pounds.  I am on half the metformin, half the blood pressure meds, half the Levemir, and not using any Humalog.  I would really like to talk to somebody about their experience. I pee all the time, every hour.  I have to drink continually or my mouth gets unbelievably dry.  I am also pretty incontinent.  It has given me sort of a food aversion.  For instance, I have been avoiding dairy including cheese because it just doesn't taste right.  Even the thought of things like cookies, pies, candy is nauseating me.  Craving salty things, low-carb.The weight loss is great, rather unexpectedly fast.  ",RebeccaFaye
