0,Dulaglutide,Diabetes Type 2,1.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"March 31, 2022",0,"Trulicity (dulaglutide):I’m reviewing for my husband. He was first prescribed Trulicity as a pre-diabetic and to help him lose a little weight since it is a known side effect.He’s been on it for about 5 months now. He’s lost close to 100 pounds and his numbers are great.However, he has had terrible stomach pain, diarrhea, vomiting and cramping. That’s not even the worst of it. He is experiencing severe emotional outbursts, manic behavior that has caused him to lose his job and it is playing a severe traumatic strain on our marriage.This medication is more addictive than most illicit drugs. He tends to take his dose a day sooner every week to get the revved up feeling he gets the first few days after a new injection. He will stay awake for days at a time and is extremely fidgety to where he cannot sit still and must be doing something.He already suffers from alcoholism on top of it and this medication seems to amplify it. I cannot stress enough the dangers of this medication.",Stay Away From

I had nausea for a little bit seems to hit in the evening time time on the 0.05 dose. Then got upped to 1.5 then I became very constipated ended up in the hospital but then ate some beans that help that. Then was up to 3.0 I was very, very sick very constipated, vomiting so then ate beans again and then was sick with very bad diarrhea for about 4 days. My doctor moved me back down to the 1.5 and it been good my body seems more comfortable at the 1.5 no constipation or diarrhea. I don't have a gallbladder so I like the injection because it has slowed down my digestive system. My blood sugar is low and my bowels are normal. I started in Nov. I still eat low carb and treat myself here and there. Just had my blood work done so I don't know yet what my a1c is since starting Trulicity but I have lost 32lb. I'm so thankful for that I have more to go and I will get there.

4,Dulaglutide,Diabetes Type 2,9.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"March 4, 2022",1,"Trulicity (dulaglutide):Started 3 weeks ago, I take 1.5 every week and so far have had no side effects and after reading reviews here before starting I was prepared beforehand with anti nausea medication from Dr. I waited three days and braced myself for onslaught but nothing and I am so pleased. I do take Omperazole so I wonder if that has helped me? Anyway I am waiting 3 months to see about improvements. My sugar levels are great, probably better than most people without type 2. But I achieved that thru diet alone but as I am having surgery towards the end of the year I needed to get them down and now I want them to stay down and I need to loose weight in order to please my Dr to give the go ahead for the surgery hence the swap from Jardiance to Trulicity.

5,Dulaglutide,Diabetes Type 2,6.0,,"February 28, 2022",1,Trulicity (dulaglutide):I was on trulicity for five weeks unfortunately one of the side effects is pancreatitis. Which I developed so I can no longer take this medication or anything like it. I was told the vomiting and nausea was normal and would go away after a few weeks. When the symptoms  didn’t stop my wife got involved made the doctor do testing pancreatitis and they found pancreatitis. The doctor thanks my wife for her diagnosis and that I could no longer take this medication or anything like it moving forward. In the short time I was taking it my numbers dropped 60 points I am very disappointed that my body would not tolerate this. I think it works really well if your body will tolerate it.

My blood sugar readings when fasten is above 249.  Recently been having lot of problems with my pancreas function and kidneys.  Even being on diabetic meds my sugar remain high.  I was getting protein spilling in my urine.  This is the 4 day being on trulicity.  I was more nervous about injecting myself with trulicity then it really was.  I read all the reviews I was scared of the side effects.  I didn’t look forward to vomiting and being nauseated.  So far I didn’t notice feeling sick I feel calmer being on it.  I did notice that I felt a little more tired.  Normally I would eat at night and so far I notice my appetite has been suppressed.  I believe it reacts differently to every person.  With my health conditions it was worth a try.  Don’t read all the reviews that make you scared.  Give it a chance because it may save your life.,E Tran

Yesterday I had to force a snack cup of jello and some chicken broth after 5pm because I hadn't ate. I have waves of fullness and nausea every 5 minutes or so. I talked to my endocrinologist yesterday 2/7/22 and was prescribed a beta blocker for my heart rate and blood pressure. It seems to be working, but I don't like that I need it. Hopefully only 5 more days of this... I know people Trulicity has worked wonders for, I'm just not one of them.

That was about the same time that the 3.0 & 4.0 dosages had first been approved.  I was put on the 3.0 dose.  It brought my numbers back down, but the side effects were magnified and became intolerable.  Ended up with heartburn so bad, I started having to take daily heartburn medication.  Then I started having severe episodes of what I initially thought was food poisoning.  I had sulfur burps with severe vomiting and diarrhea so bad, I had to wear adult diapers during those episodes.

I have been taking a new high blood pressure med and metphormine 750mgs 2 times a day. All started same day so I thought maybe the combination of new pills all at once had done me in.

Trulicity. 75 has been working for 2 years with little or no side effects. A1C dropped from 9.5 and stayed at 5.7. Good and steady.  Right?  It has curbed my appetite, I lost about 25 lbs but need to lose more.  I wasn't  eating much, but hit a plateau.  So, my Doc talked me into increasing to 1.5.  One shot.  That was Friday night.  No appetite since then.  When I say no appetite, let be be clear.  The thought of food makes me want to puke. I have not eaten anything solid in almost a week... oh and starting Monday night, the worst searing pain in my abdomen I have ever experienced.  Diarrhea, pain... no food... oh wait, I get it.  This higher dosage will make me never eat again. That is the goal.  Gotcha.  Glucose between 72 and 94... so there is that. ",Kimmielee

I recently had a triple bypass  (heart surgery) and was very concern about this action. I did research on this medication and found it was only tested on animals not humans. It caused throat tumors in the animals and pancreatitis cancer. I then decided to see if anyone posted any review and there are over 600 hundred.  Thank you all for your reviews. You helped me and prevented me from serious complications.  I did not take the medicine and call my doctor and inform them of this. You should make your own decision on what to put in your body.

You still have to eat and behave as if you are diabetic.

No side effects, immediate A1c results, mood improvement, physically confident to engage in activities such as driving without risk of rapid drops that made me dangerous.Then it just stopped. My body hit a wall and my numbers and physical condition reverted to pre-Truliciy condition. I was changed to another once-a-week injectable with excellent response for about a year, then hit another wall. On a third brand of this class of drug but not getting any response as of yet.

I lost about  5 lbs in 2 weeks, but I was so sick 3 days out of 7 that was not a great feat.  I complained to my doctor, who said this is a side affect and gave me pills to combat the nausea.  That worked for about 3 weeks and after that nothing happened.    By the time, I stopped taking Trulicity, I was so sick I could barely function.  I took the shot on Wednesday morning and by Wednesday afternoon, I was sick until that following Monday.  Needless to say, my doctor took me off.  This medicine is dangerous.

Plus Novarapid which I had with lunch and my evening meal. I felt so ill that if I had carried on I would have got some serious complications with my life. Trulicity is hard at first for me especially the nausea and the stomach pains but you have to persevere for a few months until your body gets used to this drug.

It  replaced a daily shot of Victoza, max dose, for which I am grateful. I am awaiting my first A1c test results to see if I can finally go under 7.0 at last. . A couple of notes necessary here:  Not expecting drugs I take (including Januvia, Metformin Repaglinide plus the injectables) to produce miracles. Definitely have had a loss of appetite; but I have moderated what and how much I eat, mostly vegetarian dishes and very limited alcohol and meat. Plus been trying to walk 6000 steps/day.
