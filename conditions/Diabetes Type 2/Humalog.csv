0,Humalog,Diabetes Type 2,5.0,Taken for 5 to 10 years,"November 3, 2019",12,"I've been on Humalog for several years, I've tried Novalog and Apidra and both have given me terrible side effects.  Humalog also gave me side effects and have noticed that throughout the years it has gotten worse, the headaches start from the back of my head, then it works it way down the back of my neck and spine.  It has also creates an upset stomach that leads to acid reflux, chest pains and an increase in blood pressure.  It has sent me to the ER several times, at first not realizing it was the insulin causing all the problems.  When I stopped it to use Apidra, all the symptoms disappeared for about a week until I started getting other side effects from the Apidra that were worse and I had no choice but to go back to Humalog, I seem to have run out of options, it's I'm damned if I do, damned if I don't...in search of a better solution before it kills me...",Rick

I gave the humalog company a call but they said they had not recently received other complaints. I've been on the 100, 200, and now the 500 strength and none of them are working.
