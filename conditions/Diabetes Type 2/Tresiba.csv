0,Tresiba,Diabetes Type 2,2.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"March 11, 2022",0,"I was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes about 10 years ago, found through routine bloodwork. I was immediately put on meal time insulin, but we discovered very quickly that I am extremely sensitive to insulin. About 4-5 years ago I was put on Tresiba. I was only using 5 units a day, but went up to about 8 about 3 weeks ago. I've been feeling terrible lately, so I thought back and realized very slowly I was getting progressively worse and worse with the way I felt. My side effects have been:  some form of a headache every night from slight to debilitating; horrible joint pain mainly in my fingers and toes, itchy, congested ears, hoarse voice, blurry bad vision, depression, constant fatigue, zero libido (I'm a female), all over the place readings for no apparent reason, high fasting numbers and more. Also my A1C over the years keeps creeping up and up and up. I just switched back to a sulphonyrea, I'm so thankful! I wanted to share to let people know these things aren't just in their head!",sebela

But the side effects were awful. Vision problems, like TV static over everything. I've since learned this is called ""visual snow"", and in my case, it's nearly debilitating. I need help getting around now. Saw my eye doctor, they can do nothing to help. I was also hallucinating, and on top of it all, gained thirty pounds in a couple of months. I've never had a medication do this much damage. My doctor had no explanation for any of this. He had guaranteed this would make me feel better, but it has made me so much worse. Even after I stopped taking it, I have not recovered. Going back to metformin and hoping for the best.Horrible medication. Would not recommend it to anyone. How was this thing ever approved?",Mason

13,Tresiba,Diabetes Type 2,,Taken for less than 1 month,"October 23, 2020",42,"Started Tresiba 7 days ago after nearly 20 years on Lantus and it has been nightmarish. Had to have a COVID-19 test to rule it out but I'm sure it is linked to Tresiba getting into my system properly. My blood sugars were totally out of control for 3 days. On day 4 my sugars stabilised but headaches and crushing fatigue started. The headaches occur for 5 hours from late morning/lunchtime then disappear in the evening. By day 5 I could barely get out of bed with exhaustion and then the indigestion, reflux and coughing started. Day 6 nausea and diarrhoea and stomach pains and today terrible stomach pains all day, constant indigestion, shivering and flu like symptoms. Sugars are largely stable but regularly have random spikes even when haven't eaten.Has anybody else had such a weird, horrible experience with Tresiba?",CJAERO

15,Tresiba,Diabetes Type 2,9.0,,"January 14, 2020",11,I take Tresiba 50 units  at night for almost 8 months now combine it with Janumet XR 100/ 1000 in the morning and 5 units of Novo Rapid with light carb lunch or 10units with full lunch. I buy all my medicine in the Philippines which is cheaper there. My total MED expense a month is around $ 200 with no RX insurance but just senior citizen discount. Here my co pay for just Januvia for 90 days supply is $800 while in Manila My wife can buy it for $1 a tablet of 100 mg Januvia. So for 90 days she spends only $90 against the $ 800 co pay here in US. Tresiba I heard will cost me $ 750 copay for  a 90 days supply in USA another $750 co pay for Novo Rapid.

18,Tresiba,Diabetes Type 2,8.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"December 12, 2019",22,I feel like it has fewer side effects and better job at lowering my blood sugar than Levemir did and only having to inject once daily.

I have never relied on it to lower my A1C it is already at 6.1.  I use it to lower my sugar at night but clearly that is not working anymore, I had no side effects from the drug at all.

28,Tresiba,Diabetes Type 2,9.0,,"October 27, 2018",36,My experience with Tresiba has been outstanding. After getting the type 2 diagnosis this year I was started on Lantus twice a day. After 3 months ac1 went from above 11 to 5.8 no lie. Got switched to Tresiba which was very difficult to get through insurance and now am at once a day steady 5.5-5.7. Once a day is great no burn on injection and I feel as normal as normal can be. My end dr. felt their was  a lot more protective properties with tresiba and like the long lasting affects. My wife just got switched to a low dose and her numbers are coming down as well. Fantastic product.,chief Broady
29,Tresiba,Diabetes Type 2,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"September 22, 2018",42,I started on tresiba and started off immediately by headache then dry scratchy throat then runny nose which ended up with respiratory infection. I have Cystic Fibrosis so cannot take anything that can lower my immunity so I stopped it and switched to something else. I only started taking tresiba because Insurance no longer covered my old medication. Along with that I gained 7 pounds in six days. After being off tresiba for 2 days the weight is gone and I’m feeling better.  Don’t use if you have respiratory issues.,Lori

I’m a newly diagnosed diabetic and my doctor put me on Tresiba and Toujeo along with metformin and glimerpiride. At first I was given some samples of the tresiba and had to wait on the toujeo due to insurance cost. I had a little itching but it subsided. I have finally found the correct dose of tresiba and it works great so far along with my other diabetic medications. You just have to find the correct amount of insulin units unfortunately for your body.,Mike Honcho
32,Tresiba,Diabetes Type 2,5.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"July 31, 2018",8,I have been on Tresiba for only 5 days - I cannot get my sugars to drop below 200 - they are actually more in the high 2s / low 3s. We are working with the dose - started at 20U (200U pen) and high all the time - now I'm on 26U - still high. The doc said give this 3 more days then increase to 32U. I am not having any other side effects. I was on metformin (took myself off that) and a pump which was not working very well.  So I am hoping that once we get the dose figured out it will be worth it.  I am also starting on Ozempic but  have only had one dose so far. I'm trying to be optimistic - as I am really loving not having to wear a pump - honestly - this keeps me more honest - when I can dose for food - it gave me more freedom to cheat!,PensGirl

I was at a low does of Tresiba now I am at 45 units every evening but it just stopped working.  It doesn't matter what I eat it can be low in the evening then after I take Tresiba it will be high for example took my blood sugar at night at 176 took the Tresiba at night woke up and my sugar was 222 and this is an ongoing battle.  Clearly this is something that is not working for me at all.,mark

I was achieving the control I desired after a bout of highs prior to the change.  However, it seemed that I was having severe hay fever with a lot of mucus, and then got what we believed was the flu.  After a doctor visit, instead of going home we ended up in the ER with severe chest pains that ultimately was diagnosed as congestive heart failure.  Meds were prescribed, but I was getting worse until I stopped using the Tresiba and went back to Lantus.  Improvement was slow, but each day was a bit better. Other mucus issues are also drying up.
