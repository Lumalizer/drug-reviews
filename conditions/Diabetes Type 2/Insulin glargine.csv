I was switched to Baslagar due to insurance no longer approving coverage for Lantus. Since switching my blood glucose is higher than it was when on Lantus plus having issues such as stomach pain/issues, leg cramps, insomnia, tinnitus, headaches etc. The Baslagar pens are often faulty and don't dispense the correct dose. I've already called manufacturer twice with pens issues and all they even do is go through trouble shooting then tell me the pen is ok to use. The dial does not feel right when I dial the dose and I've even physically marked the pens and I can tell it's not always dispensing the correct dose. I know how long a pen should last and I'm still using the pens with the Baslagar 2-3 days after my pen should be used up. I'm going to beg my dr tomorrow to help me get my insurance to put me back on Lantus not only does the Baslagar pen not work right the drug itself is NOT equal to Lantus no matter what the manufacturer says.",dcgirl1969

I will have to go back on Basaglar. My last experience with Basaglar was not positive, I had higher fasting numbers than I did with Lantus. I am expecting the same this time but unlike last time my doctor won't be able to switch me back to Lantus. I am also on Novolog too, so I may have to take more short acting to counter Basaglar.

I've  only been on the new insulin for a couple of days. How long does it take before the new drug (insulin) takes effect?

9,Insulin glargine,Diabetes Type 2,,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"September 13, 2021",1,"Lantus SoloStar (insulin glargine):The problem is not with the medication, the problem is with the design of the pen itself.  The pen often jams. This is a problem when it happens during the injection. Sometimes it won't budge and the entire pen must be thrown out. Other times it will continue delivering the insulin if you apply a lot of pressure on the purple button at the tip. This happened to me and caused the needle to scratch the tissue under my skin. Within 2 days I was in the emergency room and then spent four days in the hospital trying to get this infection under control. Surgery was considered, but finally IV antibiotics over 5 days helped and I was released to continue medicating at home.The problem I believe is with the 'gear' mechanism that they use for delivery inside the pen. Each click of the gear is a nanosecond pause and opportunity for the pen to jam. I have seen other insulin manufacturers use a 'spiral' instead of a gear which propels the insulin fluidly and safely. Try Tresiba instead.",Beware

This month my Rx request for Lantus was switched over to Basaglar, which is UNACCEPTABLE and unauthorised.  I tried this and it didn't work for me.  I can't deal w/the side effects.  I find it annoying and unconscionable that insurance companies have the audacity to switch patient meds w/out first consulting a patient's physician to make sure that patients won't experience adverse reactions to a change in med.  There shouldn't be able to be doing this.  ""First Do No Harm"" should be their primary focus not their own selfish bottom line..The FDA DOESN'T consider nor did it approve Basaglar as a biosimilar 2 Lantus cuz Lantus wasn't approved under the Public Health Service Act, so there is no reference product for a proposed biosimilar product.",Frustrated-In-WA

My insurance dropped Toujeo in favor of Basalglar to reduce costs.  For me, itâ€™s much less effective.  Morning blood glucose is 20-30 points higher; night is 40-50 points higher even with a 10 unit dosage increase.   Basalglar is also 3x dilute, so it requires at least 3x injection volume increase.  The injection pens seem to require more force which causes me to bend needles when I inject in kidney fat pads (canâ€™t inject in belly anymore).   I donâ€™t like Basalglar.",John

After two months my readings still range between 250 and 315.  I started at 20 units and am now up to 50.  It probably is lowering my blood sugar to some degree, but not significantly.  I need something more effective. At this rate I'll be up to 80 units daily or more to reach my goal and will suffer side effects from such a high dose.  I feel hungry all the time since using this and I've gained weight. ",fullofsugar

Much harder to control blood glucose and it allowed me to cheat by eating that cake and increase amounts of injections. I use Lantus now once a day. So much easier. Still trying to adjust amounts (last night blood glucose was 43). Supplement with 5 units of NovoLog before each meal. Insulin spike lasts only one hour.,soxman

I struggled for so long with high blood sugar numbers and Lantus has changed that for me. I actually have normal numbers now! Lantus Solostar is so easy to use and completely painless! Its been incredible. Just one injection lasts all day long. Also Lantus doesn't peak so no low blood sugars here! I recommend Lantus and give it a ten rating. I can't stress enough how amazed I am on how well this product works! I was struggling with my blood sugar being high for so long and nothing seemed to be working! I tried pills, other insulins and still I was high! After taking Lantus my blood sugar level was actually normal! It continues to stay normal now. I was so surprised at first I even double checked my meter!",Realsis 77

However I find the pen hard to use.  I have small hands and the pen is to wide for me to grip easily and the plunger even harder to push down to inject.  I hate needles so this is ideal way for me but something slimmer and easier to push would help.  At 56 iu now it's virtually impossible to avoid pain with the injection.,Marmim0946
