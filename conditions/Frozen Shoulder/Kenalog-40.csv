0,Kenalog-40,Frozen Shoulder,1,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"January 12, 2022",2,"Excellent at getting rid of the pain and restoring range of motion in my frozen shoulder, but HORRIBLE systemic side effects in the rest of my body.  The first immediate side effect was an adrenaline rush that kept me on edge and wide awake for three nights after the injection. After a week my sleep returned to normal however then the hormonal side effects began.  I would have strings of unusual rapid-fire hot flashes one after the other.  Those lasted about two months and then tapered off.  I also stopped getting a period for 6 months.  There is plenty of research online showing that Kenalog-40 injections can mess with your HPA Axis which are your Hormone, Pituitary, and Adrenal systems.  Unfortunately I had to learn that on my own after the side effects started.  Absolutely none of this was mentioned by the (male) doctor who recommended and did the injection.  People should be forewarned and the possible side effects explained in advance.  I will never take this drug again.","MT, female"
1,Kenalog-40,Frozen Shoulder,1,Taken for less than 1 month,"July 25, 2019",20,"If I could give this zero stars I would. I have been dealing with shoulder pain for 5 years. And I have been to as many different doctors. This past week I visited an orthopedist and he told me I have shoulder impingement syndrome. He told me I could have Kenalog shots every 3 months or have a surgical procedure. So I took the initial injection and I have regretted ever allowing this in my body. The next day my face was red, hot and burning. I started crying for no reason and having hysterical thoughts. Dizzy, confused, elevated blood pressure, anger. My pain level skyrocketed within the first two days and is now at the level it was before the shot. Was NOT worth it. I wasn’t informed of the side effects and when I called the dr they basically told me that this happens to less than 10 percent of patients but I have read so many stories like mine. DON’T allow your dr to give you this if you haven’t already. Just awful stuff.",H-Marie
