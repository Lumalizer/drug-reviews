1,Ibuprofen,Frozen Shoulder,10,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"January 31, 2019",17,"This is the go to medicine for me for a frozen shoulder.  I was given Meloxicam first, but I couldn’t handle the side effects of muscle pain and insomnia.  I started the ibuprofen three days after stopping the Meloxicam, and the pain relief and stiffness were greatly relieved.  I take 400 mg a day, and no more, because that’s what works for me.  If I do take more, I become restless with no added pain relief, so why bother.",Jeff
2,Ibuprofen,Frozen Shoulder,8,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"November 21, 2017",15,I've found that taking ibuprofen (200 mg) several times daily reduces the shoulder and upper arm pain (both shoulders) and permits more flexibility. The length of time that its effect lasts is perhaps five or six hours at most...not quite long enough to get a full night's comfortable sleep.,Grampus
