1,Diclofenac,Frozen Shoulder,,,"January 30, 2022",3,I’m a nurse and I’m not sure of the day that I suddenly developed unbearable shoulder pain. I was prescribed meloxicam uhhhm it was just ok. Eventually I was told to do PT. Who has time during a pandemic I’m too tired . I purchased light range of motion shoulder cords on Amazon and started using volteran  gel. I said why not even though it’s not for shoulder. My shoulder after about 2 weeks is 90 percent. At one point the pain was so bad I couldn’t sleep at night. My shoulder would burn and I could no longer reach up.  So grateful!!!,Worked

3,Diclofenac,Frozen Shoulder,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"July 28, 2020",2,diclofenac did not alleviate the pain I hae from a frozen shoulder and it gave me side effects of  stomach pain. I'm glad it works for others.  I was hoping it would have worked for me.,Malditasea
4,Diclofenac,Frozen Shoulder,8.0,,"June 11, 2020",23,Voltaren (diclofenac):Doctor recommended surgery but I had some Voltaren gel that I used for my knee. Worked well for the knee so I used it on my left shoulder. After a couple of days applying it 3 times daily it started working. I have been using it since and it really helps. I haven't had any stomach ache problems like oral NSAID's.,Damien712
5,Diclofenac,Frozen Shoulder,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"January 27, 2020",6,I had a frozen shoulder with unbelievable pain. Nothing helped voltaren made me dizzy. I was beside myself because I couldn't do anything. Until one smart dr. Gave me a shot right in the joint of  cortisone.  It hurt going in but within seconds it started working. Left the surgery on cloud 9. That was 15 years ago and still no problem. Good luck,Lee
6,Diclofenac,Frozen Shoulder,9.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"September 22, 2019",2,"One year in to frozen shoulder I am in the thawing stage and probably have 70% of movement back. A friend recommended cataflam, within one hour I felt a small release then 24 hours and 3 pills later I had a larger rotation range forwards and backwards. I will continue to take for 2 more days in conjunction with gymn and yoga exercise then stop as advised. No side effects as yet.",Dodge
7,Diclofenac,Frozen Shoulder,1.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"October 15, 2018",14,"Voltaren (diclofenac):Did absolutely nothing for me, the pain was the same with or without using it, complete waste of money.",Sparky
8,Diclofenac,Frozen Shoulder,,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"April 3, 2018",12,"I was prescribed Diclofenac Sodium 75 mg twice daily by my physician for a severe attack of gout. I was absolutely stunned that it nearly wiped the pain away from my Frozen Shoulder- Adhesive Capsulitis. In addition, it reduced the severe back pain of advanced stenosis in my lower back by 75%. I cried for joy. The relief was within about 6 hours. After the gout subsided my physician allowed me to continue taking it though reduced the amount to a once daily pill of 75mg to avoid heart or other complications. Now only a small percentage of pain comes and goes if I take one tab every 24 hrs. I am a different person with this drug. In doing research I have never seen a drug called a ""miracle""  as I have this drug. My side effects are a minor stomach upset about every 4 days for a few hours. Taking with food helps and I will talk to dr about taking something to protect my stomach. I choose to take it with breakfast so I have relief all day.",K
9,Diclofenac,Frozen Shoulder,9.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"May 14, 2015",20,"This medication has been a God send for me.  After PT and a year of Aleve my shoulder was somewhat better but not great.  For a different issue my physician told me to stop the Aleve and try Diclofanac Sodium.  My body is very happy.  No back, neck, ankle, toe, shoulder pain.  My shoulder range of motion is almost 100%. For me, Diclofenac Sodium DR 50mg has been wonderful.",aBusyMom

11,Diclofenac,Frozen Shoulder,6.0,,"August 19, 2009",11,The first day I took this medicine I was disturbed because suddenly I noticed the itching and indigestion followed after dinner.
