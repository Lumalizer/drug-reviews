2,Nabumetone,Frozen Shoulder,7,,"July 19, 2008",50,"Relafen (nabumetone):I'm probably the only one I know taking this for inflammation from a frozen shoulder as I have had serious side effects from steriod shots, so its a viable alternative.  It's not bad, it is working slowly but definitely have to take it with food.  I'm taking 750 twice a day but started breaking them in half which is not easy but overall not a bad drug, for what it is intended for I've heard great things, not just from this site.",Anonymous
