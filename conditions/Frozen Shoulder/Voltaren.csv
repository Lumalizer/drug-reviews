0,Voltaren,Frozen Shoulder,1,Taken for less than 1 month,"March 26, 2022",0,Doesnâ€™t work I tried it for awhile and nothing. My brother in law tried it nothing. I used it on shoulder and arthritis on hand and knee nothing. Ben Gay works better and cheaper.,Anonymous
1,Voltaren,Frozen Shoulder,8,,"June 11, 2020",23,Doctor recommended surgery but I had some Voltaren gel that I used for my knee. Worked well for the knee so I used it on my left shoulder. After a couple of days applying it 3 times daily it started working. I have been using it since and it really helps. I haven't had any stomach ache problems like oral NSAID's.,Damien712
