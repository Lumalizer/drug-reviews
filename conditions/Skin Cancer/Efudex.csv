0,Efudex,Skin Cancer,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"October 15, 2020",24,"After completing my EFUDEX treatment my skin seemed to get better and then it turned out to get worse and worse, red spots where I had applied the cream. My doctor could not understandwhy and prescribed me cortisone cream, which turned out to be much worse.Another doctor said I am cancer free but from now on I have constantly broken capillaries on my face and I am not able to do any inversions or put my head down. My skin is still irritated after 6 months that I stopped using Efudex.With a very sensible skin you should be aware that this cream is not always the best option.",Sirius
1,Efudex,Skin Cancer,6.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"August 27, 2020",81,"I have been using the Efudex cream for 10 days now. I have come out in red spots on my face but I am in no pain, as yet. I am wondering if I am using it correctly.  The blotchy spots are crimson but not sore. Will it get worse because I was scared to use it but so far so good as far as pain is concerned. I do look weird though with these red spots everywhere.",Neen
2,Efudex,Skin Cancer,9.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"July 27, 2020",24,"Being a white Aussie girl who loved being outside my skin was a mess. I’m now 58. I’ve used Efudex several years ago with great success. Started again due to scaley patches on face that never went away. These reacted instantly and then disappeared. After having a break started using on pigmentations on my face. These too reacted, interestingly I started getting reactions on places I didn’t put the cream. So I started putting the cream there too. My face is a mess, very itchy, sore.  I certainly wouldn’t recommend using this on large areas at a time due to the uncomfortableness of the process. I know it will be worth it, so I will continue on. I have some lumps on my head, once my face is done I will be doing my scalp.",Didewson
3,Efudex,Skin Cancer,8.0,,"January 18, 2020",40,"Two weeks after efudex and my skin looked incredible - soft and everyone asked if I got a peel! 1 day later day 15 there was burn abrasions, raised cuts and I went to my scheduled two week check in with dr and she said it’s working Beautifully and continue for two more weeks. During week 3 I had small cuts all over my face where I applied cream 2x a day. Small scabby cuts also appeared on my scalp, chest even though I didn’t apply the medication there. The dr said that was strange, but I read in the leaflet it’s plausible. Horrible taste in mouth and sick to my stomach within 20 min of applying still. I’m in horrible pain, look awful and two more weeks to go. Had SCC with two Mohs surgery then reconstruction of Nose and head earlier last year. I'm 47  years old and grew up in  cal sun. Hope this prevents future SSC",JMe
4,Efudex,Skin Cancer,9.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"August 7, 2019",46,"Used Efudex on my whole face 10 years ago. I think it was for 4 weeks. Week 2 the redness turned into lesions on my whole face , especially my left side (drivers side).Hurt like hell. I play poker sometimes at a casino. I didn't have to look at me so my appearance wasn't my problem.After the lesions healed my face was as smooth as  a baby's butt.  A couple of the players were surprised I was still alive because I looked like I had full blown aids. I recommend it as I had no idea my face was such a mess. It is an ordeal.Using it on my ear now. started 6 weeks ago and in the last few days.  Fingers crossed. Not pleasant but hopefully I can avoid surgery and plastic surgery .",ET
5,Efudex,Skin Cancer,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"July 17, 2019",33,This cream should be banned. After using it for three weeks I had a bad reaction to it. I have lost my taste and my skin has a terrible rash. Three weeks since I stopped using it I still have no taste. My life is ruined if my taste doesn’t come back. :( Do not use,Teece
6,Efudex,Skin Cancer,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"September 26, 2018",29,I was prescribed efudex for squamous carcinoma. Was told to do both arms from elbow to fingers. One at a time of course. I'm just over three weeks of using it and it has not worked at all. Doctor can't understand why.,Deb
7,Efudex,Skin Cancer,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"November 16, 2017",49,"At 65yo and lifetime in the sun and numerous treatments including surgery, cryotherapy etc Doctor said will have to use Efudix to whole face as had untold AK's plus Bowens Disease. Told it was a ''brutal'' treatment. He was right.All I can say is that this treatment was the most painfull experience in my life. By week two I was in agony but forced myself to continue the three week treatment. A word of warning. Under no circumstances get this stuff on your genitals. I did and it was agonising. Pain so intense sent me into depression for 3 months. Results were excellent however and no regrets.",Philpara
8,Efudex,Skin Cancer,5.0,,"March 20, 2015",53,"Used years ago my arms and it was successful for a time, after healing. But arms look like they once did. Red hair and freckles growing up in az before sunblock was used!! Now using on forehead. It's miserable I hope it works. All I can say is take it one day at at time. Keep battling.",War dog
9,Efudex,Skin Cancer,10.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"November 14, 2014",109,"Before I started with Efudex I googled pictures and reviews, on seeing the pictures I decided to do one part of my face at a time, lip first and now I've just done 2 weeks on the right side of my face and I'm glad I did especially because I work in retail and the pain of feeling like you have cold sores all over your face, thank God for makeup is all I can say. I will do my right side once my left has healed and then my forehead followed by a micro dermabrasion. I think this product is amazing and the way it keeps working after you stop applying. Those who did your whole face all at once I take my hat off to you.",Dee63
10,Efudex,Skin Cancer,,,"February 5, 2014",44,"Im treating slightly raised warts which only partially respond to tea tree oil, EGCG cream, tazarotene and many herbal ointment containing thuja plus etc essential oils. To those wanting to use Efudex, there are articles stating 1% /0.5% are better tolerated, compared with 5%. But Carac is magnitude more expensive. I guess the lower % is less irritating as normal cells are not absorbing as much. If you have deep growth, 5FU may cause significant inflammation/edema that may be excruciatingly painful .I found using oral Serrapeptase 120k Ux2(empty stomach) helps a lot in terms of managing inflammation and pain. It seems the warts are responding dramatically",BJ02145
11,Efudex,Skin Cancer,,Taken for less than 1 month,"May 4, 2013",222,"Age 66 - spent many years at sea and as you can imagine my facial skin was a mess. Doctor put me on Ufedix (how it is called here) two weeks ago and the results are amazing. Of course it is not a pretty sight and sleeping is a bit difficult, the reaction was clearly pictured in the brochure that I was given at the clinic - but it does not truly describe the actual sensations associated with the inflamation. A little concerned I browsed for reviews and found this sight - after reading the experiences of other users I feel much releaved - thanks to all for sharing their experiences, now I am looking forward to seeing the end result. Stay safe and keep well. Thank you.",outdooraussie
12,Efudex,Skin Cancer,5.0,,"February 6, 2011",84,"Efudex successfully combated skin abnormalities that my doctor had cancer concerns about. I used Efudex for ten days and then stopped because of blistering; they were small, but covered my face. It's been almost two months after my treatment and I still have an unsightly, coarse rash. The steriod cream I used five days afterwards eased the appearance of the rash, but because of concerns over skin thinning, I could not continue with the cream.",Anonymous
13,Efudex,Skin Cancer,9.0,,"September 25, 2008",217,"This product works very well to eliminate skin cancers.It becomes quite irritating after a few days, and very irritating at about 10 days, but it gets rid of the skin cancer in a couple of weeks.",olyfoxtrax
