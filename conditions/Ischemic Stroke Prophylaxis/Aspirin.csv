0,Aspirin,Ischemic Stroke Prophylaxis,10,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"April 27, 2018",15,"Bayer Women's Aspirin With Calcium (aspirin):It's the only aspirin product I can tolerate. All others, even ""coated"" low dose aspirin cause GI upset. It's also significantly more expensive. For some reason lately I have been having difficulty finding this product. That said, I'm glad I found an aspirin product that does not cause GI upset (I take it for stroke prevention which is very rampant in my family).",Beebe
