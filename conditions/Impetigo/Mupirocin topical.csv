0,Mupirocin topical,Impetigo,1,Taken for less than 1 month,"February 16, 2021",1,That only made it worse - Kept it wet which made it ooooze . Dreadful ! The only  thing that worked for me  - is spraying alcohol directly on it ! every time I felt   a little  itchy I still will spray alcohol  - it burns like fire ! But it dried it out and made it go  away   and Doxycycline  along with  the alcohol spray !  I would  and had gotten it off and on  often . And it was bad right below my nose or on my chin !  I would just sit at computer searching for different ways to make it go away .,eee
1,Mupirocin topical,Impetigo,1,Taken for less than 1 month,"November 4, 2020",2,I  seem to get this Impetigo every year and it really sucks! So what I found helped me is to be spraying  alcohol on it when ever it itches - Sure it hurts like anything but at  least it wasn't  as bad a when I put mupirocin on it . With in 5 minutes I was at the Gross  STAGE  OF A WEEPING HONEY CRUSTED MESS . I mean this erupted on my right side of mouth-  So basically I washed THAT stuff OFF AND SPRAYED ALCOHOL ON IT AND ITS  BETER .    Hopefully your experience will be better - I am also on Doxycycline which has helped in the past. WARNING - if you feel a little tingling  on your face act quick spray alcohol - get antibiotics and  pray it won't last as long as mine did before - too many months,Mselaineious
2,Mupirocin topical,Impetigo,3,,"May 17, 2020",9,"I'm 19 and was prescribed this for a bad case of impetigo around the corners of my mouth. I was told it would go away after 3-4 days if I used this ointment but immediately noticed extreme, and I mean EXTREME itching and burning that wasn't there before. I nearly cried from the itching. I also had a ton of redness and experienced yellowish brown lesions that were intensely dry and peeling constantly. I thought it was just the impetigo getting worse but it was actually the ointment that made it worse. This stuff completely RUINED my skin and even after stopping the use of this, my skin is still very discolored and dry. I should mention that this did get rid of the impetigo, it just gave me new problems that I now have to deal with on my own.",bunnybaby
3,Mupirocin topical,Impetigo,8,Taken for less than 1 month,"July 4, 2018",8,Mupirocin worked on my Impetigo but the weird thing is the finger that I used ( washed hands before and after) to apply this got tendonitis ( hurt so much!). I was confused because this is not the group of drugs that should cause that but when I started to apply with the other hand same thing happened. It was scary and weird. OK drug but watch for side effects.,wacomom

5,Mupirocin topical,Impetigo,10,Taken for less than 1 month,"May 19, 2017",14,Thought I had horrible acne. Tried other things that online doctors prescribed. Made it worse. Went to my primary after not being able to go to work because I was so embarrassed by my face. She diagnosed it as impetigo and gave the ointment because it stays on longer. Not even 24 hours and it's almost cleared up. AMAZING. Zero side effects.,rhsess00
