1,Triamcinolone,Pityriasis rubra pilaris,10,,"November 30, 2009",6,"Kenalog-10 (triamcinolone):I have Pityriasis Rubra Pilarius, or PRP.  My feet developed a horrible thick peeling layer that cracked and bled continuously.  Topical ointments such as Clobetasol did not help relieve my symptoms.  Kenalog-10 injections over the bottoms of my feet cleared them up within weeks.",NolaMN
