1,Temovate,Psoriasis,10,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"April 29, 2014",34,Works best when applied at night before sleep. Good for use on the body. Not for face or other sensitive skin areas. I've only been using it for a couple of months but the results are better than any other products that I've used in the past.,Safjaf
