1,Clobex,Psoriasis,10.0,Taken for 5 to 10 years,"September 19, 2019",22,"I have used Clobex for many years.  It is the only product that has worked for me.  Thankfully, I currently only have psoriasis on my scalp.  I use the spray and rub it into my entire scalp.  I am only able to use it once a day, at night time, and it usually takes 3 days for my scalp to be clear.  Then I can go a couple of months before I have to use it again.  I have asked my dermatologist about using the shampoo instead of spray but he has said that he believes the spray works better than the shampoo.",Fran

3,Clobex,Psoriasis,10.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"September 3, 2018",13,"I've had psoriasis for 28 years and this is the first thing that after a few weeks my psoriasis is gone. Once cleared, I stopped using it and it's been about two weeks and still clear. I feel a tiny piece coming back on my elbows so will need to use it for maintenance but for the time being, best stuff ever prescribed. Also it was only $35 through a mail in pharmacy my doctor sent it through and said they have lots of coupons and such and would be way cheaper than a CVS and he was right.",Courtlynn
4,Clobex,Psoriasis,1.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"July 18, 2018",19,"I was on clobex spray and shampoo for several years at the direction of several dermatologists. I would use regularly and then take breaks while I was clear. The clearing time would get shorter and shorter - in between I was not able to maintain the clearance with lower potency steroids. Every time my Psoriasis would come back angrier, redder, patcher, more itchy than before. In 2 years on Clobex on and off - my coverage went from 5% to 30% - started becoming aggressive and not responding to clobex on my legs. BEWARE of this medication. If it seems too good to be true - it's because it is. I was trapped in the clearance-worse outbreak-anxiety-clearance-horrible outbreak cycle for years. This medication is not a cure-all and can make your Psoriasis worse in the long-term.",notforme
5,Clobex,Psoriasis,9.0,,"December 6, 2017",8,"I used Clobex spray this summer for 4 weeks in June 2017.  This gave me almost immediate clear skin on my elbows.  This lasted until September (long sleeve season).  Thanks Clobex,  I plan on using this every summer to give me clear skin during short sleeve weather.  Hopefully some day they find a permanent cure for this disease !",HockeyFan88
6,Clobex,Psoriasis,10.0,,"March 24, 2017",3,Clobex is in shampoo form. I use that weekly. Need 2 tsp. Lathers up really well. I leave the shampoo on for a few hours then rinse. This is a great maintenance first me between the spray applications- I apply the spray on wet hair/scalp so it stretches the product more bc it's expensive.,Clobex Discount Available
7,Clobex,Psoriasis,10.0,,"June 17, 2016",50,CLOBEX IS AMAZING.  It doesn't cure psoriasis but it will clear you up.  My scalp is bad.  within a week I was completely clear.  I could go 2 weeks before it started to appear back on scalp.  I use the spray for a few days and it was gone....Problem now is there is a generic so my insurance will not pay for the brand.  The cost of brand out of pocket is 900.00.  Who has that kind of money?  the generic does absolutely nothing for me.  No relief what so ever.  The entire insurance industry is such a crock in the USA.,DONNA SUT
8,Clobex,Psoriasis,10.0,,"June 17, 2016",17,"I've tried almost everything for psoriasis in the past. It was an extremely embarrassing time in my life. I was at the point that I was going to ask the doctor if he could just surgically remove the areas. Then I tried clobex spray. Within 2 weeks it was completely gone. Being a nurse, I've run across alot of patients that I have suggested them to try this spray. They have all had success and come back to thank me. I even tried it on my poison ivy and it worked wonders. Thank you to the makers of Clobex. You have changed my life. Forever grateful!!",Zmommyof4
9,Clobex,Psoriasis,10.0,,"October 26, 2015",56,I would use clobex on my thick plaque psoriasis on my scalp. It literally cleared it up completely within 48 hrs to the point where I can go and get my hair cut. The best med I've used in my 30 years of trying everything,Lilmack
10,Clobex,Psoriasis,10.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"March 25, 2015",26,The spray is amazing...only thing that will clear my scalp...Right now my scalp is in a mess because my insurance will not pay on it and it is $400 for a 4oz bottle...I can't afford that.,karenlynn58
11,Clobex,Psoriasis,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"January 21, 2015",41,"Clobex for my skin. I can't say enough good things about this spray.  I say ""spray"" because the ointment did nothing.  The spray, for some reason is absolutely amazing.  One place on my knee where the P wasn't removable with a jackhammer, magically cleared up 99% of the area in less than 1 week.  My arms - my chest - EVERYTHING - it's gone.  My Psoriasis is gone.  I've gone through shampoos. NOW - if I stop using the spray for a week or longer, the symptoms return - but until a cure is found for Psoriasis - this medication is hands-down, the absolute best there is.",Wess
12,Clobex,Psoriasis,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"May 2, 2014",43,"After about a year with this, I went to see a doctor & I was just diagnosed with pustular psoriasis - palms of hands and bottom of feet only. Before seeing a doctor, I started juicing heavily - 200lbs (no, that's not a typo) of carrots in three weeks & added green juices to my regimen as well. My hands had completely cleared and my feet were almost completely clear. But because of another issue, I went to my doctor - and because of the then upcoming tests I backed off of my juicing completely. The psoriasis came back on my hands and feet. While I wasnt juicing, I figured I would find out what it was. Doc gave me the Clobex spray. For the immediate painful inflammation problems in my feet caused by the psoriasis, this stuff is AWESOME.",BeachLizard1
13,Clobex,Psoriasis,,,"March 20, 2014",60,"I used this medication as directed and it completely cleared up my psoriasis. However, I became extremely stressed. I didn't know why I felt this way until someone else who used it experienced the same. After stopping it my adrenal glands were fatigued and I suffered from depression. My psoriasis also returned. This is very potent and I advise anyone who wants to use it to use something more natural and more safe.",Anonymous
14,Clobex,Psoriasis,,,"February 25, 2014",40,"Clobex cleared up my psoriasis but it suppressed my adrenal glands which made me extremely stressed, anxious which led to depression. ",Anonymous
15,Clobex,Psoriasis,10.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"November 15, 2013",25,"I love this stuff... I actually use a different medication for my body called Stelara and I love that product as well. But this is a good back up for special occasions when I want to let my hair down! I spray several days before the event and I am almost clear. I spray before bed and sleep with it in my hair and then around noonish I wash my hair! Also don't wear nail polish while applying, It will be like nail polish remover. Great product.",MrsNMcFarland
16,Clobex,Psoriasis,9.0,,"January 6, 2013",28,"I have been using Clobex spray for nearly 2 years. It is the best so far. My psoriasis is on my scalp, elbows and small spots here  and there on my body.  The Spray is the wonderful, real easy to use for applying to my scalp at odd angels.",lvodron
17,Clobex,Psoriasis,9.0,,"March 29, 2012",31,"Clobex is the only thing that worked.  Severe patches and redness went away in only days. Its expensive and is a very strong medicine, a little goes a long way.",headtripp

19,Clobex,Psoriasis,3.0,,"October 12, 2010",48,"I used Clobex this summer for itching and dry flakes in my scalp.  I became sick with a bad cold and later turned to pneumonia.  I was sick all summer long with trouble breathing and wheezing.  I went to an ENT and a lung doctor. None of us could figure out what was causing the lung problem.  After several months I was getting better with the breathing problems.  Last week I used Clobex again because the itching scalp came back.  Two days later I am having breathing problems.  I put 2 and 2 together, read the side effects of Clobex and breathing problems and wheezing are the first side effects listed.  All that suffering because I did not read the medical bulletins earlier.",Anonymous
20,Clobex,Psoriasis,5.0,,"September 27, 2010",28,"I got this psoriasis when I was in my early 20's and I thought it was nothing because it started in my head. Itching and redness followed but still I ignored it not until it got bigger then I went to my doctor to get checked up. First, he doesn't know what kind of condition I have. He gave me a lot of things that made no effects on my skin. Bottom line was he didn't made me feel better until I discovered Clobex. I used the shampoo and spray in the same time but you need to be aware that over time any medications will not work. You need to take a break otherwise you will be immune to it or even worse. My skin cleared but after few months it came back so be careful using any medications.",702
21,Clobex,Psoriasis,10.0,,"December 28, 2009",23,"This medication calmed down the inflamation in psoriasis. I was so pleased with the results. After about two weeks of twice daily use, my skin appeared to be getting back to normal; however, I will be starting on Stelara because Humira was ineffective. I can see that all the psoriasis medications are individualized to each person.",Gwynie1
22,Clobex,Psoriasis,9.0,,"October 24, 2009",28,I had a severe case of psoriasis at the base and outer areas of my hair line with severe itching and the Clobex lotion cleared it up in a week. I used a little on the affected area only.,Anonymous
23,Clobex,Psoriasis,5.0,,"September 21, 2009",43,"I have had psoriasis for years and have treated it with cortisone to control the inflammations and itching.  I discovered Clobex about a year ago and used it on my elbows and scalp.  It does a great job in eliminating the external signs of psoriasis when used for 2 to 4 weeks.  However, after about a month the symptoms return.  I have used it a second and third time with the same results but I am hesitant to continue this process considering the warnings provided.",Anonymous
24,Clobex,Psoriasis,6.0,,"March 19, 2009",109,"I have had moderate and sometimes severe plaque and guttate psoriasis for 16 years, using clobetasol (clobex) for 14. Clobex is the only thing that can eliminate my psoriasis almost completely. It is a very effective drug, but I feel I really should warn people of the devastating effects that can occur if the drug is applied continuously. When using clobex or any other strong topical corticosteroid, you are supposed to use it for no more than 2 weeks, then take a break I believe should be between 2 and 3 weeks. I made the mistake of not doing that. I used it continuously because I wanted to be clear. Now, my skin is paper thin. Nearly every vein is visible, and I break blood vessels constantly, and I have stretch marks everywhere.",Anonymous
25,Clobex,Psoriasis,10.0,,"July 2, 2008",42,"I got psoriasis in March after a strep infection. I probably had 1,000 spots on my legs, a few spots on my scalp and arms and chest, but my legs were horrible. My doctor gave me some samples of Clobex spray and after 1 week my Psoriasis is 80% gone. He said I need to go in a mega tan bed for 15 minutes and take 8,000 IU of Vitamin D3 and take zinc, so doing all that I am so thrilled with the results. I would recommend Clobex to anyone - pricey but so worth it.",indygoblu
