0,Prednisone,Psoriasis,,,"February 22, 2022",0,"Had wide spread of psoriasis and prurigo. Rash and hives at night, so I could not sleep. Doctor gave me a steroid shot + 10 days of 20mg prednisone.  It was like magic 90% clearing and  my skin had not felt this good in the last two years. It will be temporary but gives me time to seek a biologic instead of the standard Dermatologist treatment with Clobetasol etc.",kal
1,Prednisone,Psoriasis,1.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"September 23, 2021",0,"I took this steroid for 6 weeks starting from 6 tablets of 5mg a day going down a tablet each week. As soon as you finish your dose, the psoriasis goes completely crazy. It becomes darker and you get more flare ups especially at night. Every night for me. I would never recommend these steroids.",Amina

I went from 40% covered to 90% covered and it was severe. Prednisone and oral steroids have a tendency to cause rebound full flare after use in psoriasis patients.",Skintight

7,Prednisone,Psoriasis,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"May 7, 2020",22,"I have had psoriasis for years, but it turned really bad a few years ago. My the tops of my feet were completely raw oozing, and unhealable. I finally went to the Dermatologist, who wanted to run patch tests, but I insisted he treat me at once. I was prescribed a Prednisone for ~2 week period with Methotrexate and blood testing to assure no liver damage. My skin was completely clear everywhere, for the first time in my life -for at least 2 years.  Also, using otc moisturizers daily has helped.",phil

Had plaque psoriasis at the start and during the dosage developed guttate, pustular and inverse patches which had not been present prior to starting the drug. And I got nearly all the side effects.",Nanny
11,Prednisone,Psoriasis,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"March 26, 2017",6,I have psoriasis on my hands and was prescribed prednisone.  And yes it cleared my psoriasis up in under 2 weeks but the side effects of this drug are worse then the psoriasis is.  Horrible!!!,Lowjac
12,Prednisone,Psoriasis,10.0,,"September 2, 2015",46,"I have been experiencing horrible psoriasis on my feet that had me depressed then I started to also experience joint pain (in almost every joint). After a million test my rheumatologist prescribed me prednisone, and honestly after all the bad reviews I didn't want to take it but thank God after a couple months I did. My psoriasis cleared up dramatically! It's like a miracle that I hope is not short lived...If you are dealing with severe psoriasis and haven't had any relief I would highly suggest you at least try it short term. It will change your life for the better...",Tiffmik
