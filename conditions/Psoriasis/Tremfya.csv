0,Tremfya,Psoriasis,,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"March 8, 2022",0,"I have minor-to-mild psoriasis, about 10-12 relatively small but persistent spots for years. Ointments would work temporarily but I had to constantly reapply and they would stain my clothes. I tried Otezla too and that helped a bit at first but I stopped seeing any benefit after several months. Tremfya has been AMAZING. I finally have my skin back! I love how easy and infrequent I have to take it (and for someone who is afraid of needles I find the approach very manageable. My skin is clear without any noticeable spots after two months.",T Fox
1,Tremfya,Psoriasis,3.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"December 13, 2021",1,"I have a severe case of psoriasis only on the bottoms of my feet. Over the past 30 years, I tried all of the standard topical and oral medications. Nothing worked. I've been doing the Tremfya injections for 20 weeks. I've seen only minimal improvement. I was hoping for better.",DaveS
2,Tremfya,Psoriasis,1.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"November 29, 2021",4,I feel like just so awful! Very sick with pain and I think I have inverse psoriasis  Very painful and very itchy. I didn't have any of these issues till I started Tremfya. I  have been on the medication for 7 months and went to the Dr and they said keep taking it and if my condition doesn't get better go to your primary. What???? They are the specialists. Don't know what to do please help.,Scott
3,Tremfya,Psoriasis,1.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"December 1, 2020",6,Dermatologist recommended I switch from Enbrel to Tremfya after 7 years of my psoriasis under control. Tremfya did nothing. My scaling came back in multiple areas and I had blotching on my face as well. Bye bye Tremfya.,Walt
4,Tremfya,Psoriasis,10.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"October 29, 2020",8,"I have been on Tremfya for about 12 months now and have really loved the results. I do have small flare ups just before I am due to take my next injection but over all I have remained psoriasis free. I do have  some joint pain which I assume is from the Tremfya but even so it is worth it. Wes, I think you will find getting hypothyroidism could be linked to already having an autoimmune condition such as psoriasis. Often when you have one auto immune condition you are at risk of ending up with two or three. I have both of these conditions. I find intermittent fasting does help a little bit with my overall health.",KSlice
5,Tremfya,Psoriasis,,,"September 19, 2020",5,"Hi, Ive been on steroids few times in past 10 years. The only thing that helps me is healing naturally without steroids and medication. The healing process includes holistic approach not just physical but emotional and spiritual approach.",Healing challenge
6,Tremfya,Psoriasis,10.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"August 19, 2020",9,I have been on Tremfya for about a year. What a wonderful medication and psoriasis free! I've been through four other biologics and works like Tremfya!,MA
7,Tremfya,Psoriasis,8.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"August 11, 2020",13,I’ve been on Tremfya for about a year now. I’ve been a lifelong sufferer of psoriasis and this was the first drug that really cleared up my skin. It’s been amazing but my only issue is that it’s now causing me sensitivity to the sun. I break out with a horrible itchy rash on my hands and chest. I’ve tried all kinds of treatments for that and have yet to find a successful one. Is this happening to anyone else? Do you have a thought about what I can do about it? I waited so many years to have clear skin and now this. ,Toasty
8,Tremfya,Psoriasis,9.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"June 10, 2020",10,I have psoriasis but I take this medicine more for psoriatic arthritis. It has not yet been approved by the FDA as of this writing for that purpose. Other medicines in the same category have been approved for this treatment. My psoriasis plaques cleared about 95% after a few months. No side effects that I've noticed. My only complaint is that you take the medicine every 8 weeks on maintenance dosage. By the 6th week I have bad joint pain flare ups in my knees and hand joints. So usually by that time I'm asking for a cortisone shot and begin taking meloxicam along with it until my next dose.,Bob
9,Tremfya,Psoriasis,6.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"October 4, 2019",13,"Been on Tremfya for about a year now.  I had some form of psoriasis on about 80% of my body before I began treatment.  After the first injection I had 70% clearer skin and 100% after the second.  The needle is tiny and it is really easy to give myself the injection with little to no discomfort.  No joint pain, I have hypothyroidism so I cannot comment on the fatigue side effects as I am always tired anyway.  Did have minor headaches for a couple days after injections.Loved the drug but within the last month I have started developing plaques on my scalp and elbows again.  Sad doesn’t even begin to describe my emotions.  I have another 4 weeks until my next injection so we’ll see what happens.  Heading back to the dermatologist if my symptoms worsen after that.",LC83
10,Tremfya,Psoriasis,6.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"September 15, 2019",17,Started Tremfya Feb 2019 after Taltz stopped working for my psoriasis. Currently about 6 months in I got swelling in my neck.  Went to my GP and was told I now have hypothyroidism and a low blood count.  Not sure if this was caused by Tremfya but am concerned because my next dose is coming  up and I don't know what to do.  Will be going to see my dermatologist soon to see what he says. Has anyone had anything like this while on this medication.,Wes
11,Tremfya,Psoriasis,9.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"September 8, 2019",6,"15 mo on Tremfya for Psoriasis Pros: confidence in public settings, 100% skin clearance, super easy company to work with if insurance won’t cover, once every 8 weeks after startup compared to daily. Cons: many bouts of upper respiratory illnesses, several skin infections, skin sensitivity to sun, diarrhea, extreme tiredness week before my shot, will not help joints.",Locksloy
12,Tremfya,Psoriasis,,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"August 5, 2019",10,"I started Tremfya in February 2019. Now my skin is clear, joint pain 90% gone, however, questionable upper respiratory infection after the 2nd shot, and bronchitis after 3rd and now 4th shot. Side effects after 4th shot included worsening bronchitis, fever, chills, and big time malaise... almost flu like symptoms. Continuing to take Tremfya until I can trend the patterns and make sure they are related under my Dr's observations.",Anonymous
13,Tremfya,Psoriasis,9.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"April 26, 2019",12,Been on Tremfya for over 6 months. Cleared 100% almost immediately. Failed Humira and Cosentyx previously. Body aches and joint pain on the rise. Cold sores occurring. A couple of intense colds . Energy drain. So far worth the side effects  for me. For now:),Ambo
