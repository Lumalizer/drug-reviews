0,Triamcinolone,Psoriasis,10,,"August 8, 2021",2,"Kenalog-40 (triamcinolone):Kenalog has changed my life. I have hand psoriasis and for years tried every topical prescription steroid and treatment out there,  to no avail. The very first time I had a few Kenalog injections in my hand, the skin cracks healed, the plaques thinned and my hands were normal again. Miraculous. In addition I had severe hip bursitis and kenalog allowed me to continue walking up and down the 15 stairs in my home without issue.After a few months it needs to be reinjected but I t’s an absolute life changer for me.",Squee99
1,Triamcinolone,Psoriasis,10,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"November 24, 2020",4,Kenalog-40 (triamcinolone):My menstruation is totally out of control while on Kenalog injections (for psoriasis). It’s heavy as last 7-10 days vs 4-5 light days when I’m not on Kenalog. I was on it for a 6 mo period having injections every 4 weeks. Til I couldn’t take the heavy cycle and my hemoglobin dropped to 7. Last month I got back on the Kenalog because of the psoriasis was so bad and inflamed. Now the second set of injections this month my cycle is heavy already. Not sure what to do I’m very disappointed.,Tonya
2,Triamcinolone,Psoriasis,10,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"October 24, 2020",2,"Kenalog-40 (triamcinolone):I love this drug Kenalog-40. My entire body hurt, my joints hurt all over my body.  This drug is a miracle, but not without side effects.  You will get a round face but it’s not awful.  I did develop a bit of a hump on my back, but that will go away.   I can’t take  another one for about 2 months But I wish I could now",Dee
3,Triamcinolone,Psoriasis,9,,"August 24, 2014",20,Kenalog-40 (triamcinolone):My Dermatologist give me tiny injections under the skin on each plaque.  My hands can get really bad.  Usually by the next day or two they are gone.  It lasts quite awhile.  I also get injections of Kenalog plus numbing agent for severe muscle spasms from Fibromyalgia.  The Pain Management doctor injects the muscles where the spasms are. By the next day I'm 90% better.  Usually I only have to get these a few times a year.  So Kenelog works really well for me.,JE2

5,Triamcinolone,Psoriasis,10,,"September 16, 2010",9,Within a matter of days my Psoriasis completely cleared up and as soon as it did I was able to completely lay off the prescription and not have reoccurring symptoms. Very pleased with my outcome.,Anonymous
6,Triamcinolone,Psoriasis,10,,"May 18, 2009",16,"It was amazing. I've had a large, full body, break out of psoriasis for about month now. This was due to the fact that 4 previous physicians could not figure out what it was. I went to a dermatologist, he gave me triamcinolone and it made my skin look so much better in a matter of days.",Anonymous
