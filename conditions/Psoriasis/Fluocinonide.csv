8,Fluocinonide,Psoriasis,10,,"June 5, 2015",16,I was diagnosed with psoriasis about 3 yrs ago after years of being told it was dandruff on my scalp and eczema on my face. When I told my doctor it seemed to flare up when my arthritis did he realized I had Psoriatic Rheumatoid Arthritis. Long story short...he told me to use this and every time my face flares up I use it the night before and in the morn it's 90% gone. I'm only 38...I know the shot would be better but I have no side effects from this. The shot I would. I recommend the solution over the cream or gel.,ShelG

10,Fluocinonide,Psoriasis,10,Taken for less than 1 month,"July 3, 2014",9,I always have had psoriasis of the scalp but recently it has started on one armpit.  It is very uncomfortable so my mom who is a nurse gave me a tube of this. It worked within a day but I lost out and it broke out terribly bad like I thought nothing could help it.  I found the tube and it looked awesome after just one day.  Just finished my second day and it had faded quite a bit more. I'm sure it won't be long till its completely gone. Can't wait.  It's the summer and I can't always keep my arms down.,sidebottom

13,Fluocinonide,Psoriasis,9,,"November 7, 2009",80,"Lidex (fluocinonide):Easy to use on scalp conditions compared to oils. Can burn a little, but two thorough applications will clear up the problem for 7 to 10 days. Apply once a week before a break out and it keeps the problem under control. I have been using it for 3 months and no side effects yet. I have a full head of hair, my scalp can get really bad and this works. I am a 62 yr. old white male.",Anonymous

I have experienced no side effects and for the last 2 years my psoriasis has gone. The coverage area was not great so I did not use huge amounts of this ointment.
