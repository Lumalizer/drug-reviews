1,Lidex,Psoriasis,10,,"September 20, 2013",15,While I was pregnant my psoriasis freaked out. It went all over my body. I could see a difference every day until it was gone. One of the only medicines that didn't set my skin on fire.,Kaboom
2,Lidex,Psoriasis,1,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"August 19, 2013",9,Did not phase my psoriasis in any way. It did manage to take my fingertips off the fingers I was using to apply it. I would have thought it was pretty strong based on that. But did nothing for my patches.,Miemieknotts
3,Lidex,Psoriasis,9,,"November 7, 2009",80,"Easy to use on scalp conditions compared to oils. Can burn a little, but two thorough applications will clear up the problem for 7 to 10 days. Apply once a week before a break out and it keeps the problem under control. I have been using it for 3 months and no side effects yet. I have a full head of hair, my scalp can get really bad and this works. I am a 62 yr. old white male.",Anonymous
