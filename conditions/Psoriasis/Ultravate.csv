0,Ultravate,Psoriasis,9,,"June 27, 2016",7,"I have had psoriasis for many years (40) and have seasonably felt the conditions itchiness during the springtime.  This year, fed up with the condition, I used Ultravate liberally on all areas where condition exists, but this time, I also exposed the area so UV rays of 9 and above for quite some time, building up to an exposure of one hour in the sunlight.  Did not find suntan booths beneficial.  Where psoriasis use to be, now it is only an area that you can see, but it no longer itches.  I also use coconut oil on the areas to keep the moisture in.  After sun exposure, use coconut oil on top of the Ultravate and go in the shade and let the ultravate and coconut oil kind of dry up.  It works for me.",Old man Stu
