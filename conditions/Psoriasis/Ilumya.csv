0,Ilumya,Psoriasis,7,,"September 24, 2019",7,"I had tried all the creams & all the biologics available. My palmoplantar pustular psoriasis, inverse, & plaque resisted Everything. Then Ilumya was released by the FDA. My post psoriasis has improved IMMENSELY after 5 months. The plaque has improved , the last to go is the inverse psoriasis which is always a battle.  Hopefully we're getting there - w a with remission of it all. The only problem I have with Ilumya is it does not treat psoriatic arthritis so that had to be dealt with separately.",Seahorse02
1,Ilumya,Psoriasis,2,,"July 30, 2019",7,Iâ€™ve had psoriasis for over 30 years and have been poster child for medication both internal and external. First breakthrough came with Enbrel. It cleared me from head to stomach and then stopped. Went to Humira and Stelara with no good results. Then I went to Taltz and it just about cleared me up but did get a lot of side effects. Hands broke out to shortly after starting. Dermatologist in the challenge of completely trying to clear me moved me to Ilumya. I have had 3 injections now and no improvement. In fact several spots have now come back. I suspect on next visit he will move me to a IL-17 drug next.,Redfalcon12
