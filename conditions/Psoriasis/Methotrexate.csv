Last summer it showed up on the palms of my hands, between my fingers, and the tips of my fingers.  Having been advised by my dermatologist to take methotrexate years ago I finally gave in and started taking 15mg once per week and 1 mg of folic acid 6 days per week.  I started this regimen in October.  My feet and hands are finally starting to clear.  The first day after the meds I feel wiped out.  I wish I had started taking this medication a long time ago.

I tried all therapies - homeopathy naturopathy. Ayurvedic treatments, nothing worked. Then I resorted to Allopathy- Doctor started with steroidal creams on cracks and they healed a bit.

8,Methotrexate,Psoriasis,10.0,,"November 2, 2019",75,Our son developed psoriasis at 14 whole body out of no where. He hid it for a long time but when he finally showed me I was heartbroken. Immediately we were referred to a skin specialist who put him on weekly methotrexate and within a week the results were staggering. He has now been on this drug for 6 years with regular blood testing all good results and it has changed his life. He will continue to take it as long as it works. Changed our lives and his life and mental well being to know he can show his body with no shame. He now takes 1 or 1.5 tablets once weekly and only ever has maybe one stubborn patch maybe on his elbows here and there. No side effects have ever happened ☺️,Happy mum
9,Methotrexate,Psoriasis,10.0,Taken for 10 years or more,"September 25, 2019",66,"I'm 71 years old and have been taking Methotrexate (mtx) since I was 13 In all these years of using between 10-15 mg/ week I have never had a problem ... and yes, blood work every three months and precautionary (cya) liver biopsies over the years (all 11 of them scored a 4+ on a scale of 5 - tahdah).  The results have always been positive - when I was younger and had severe psoriasis, the methotrexate (mtx) would slow it down, sometimes totally suppress it, the sun would help eliminate whatever was present and now that I'm (much) older, the mtx keeps me totally clear except during the winter months when things occasionally flare. My dermatologist has tried to get me on newer drugs but I've had such a lifelong success with the mtx, I won't change.  I totally endorse trying it and I simply don't buy into it being more toxic than the newer items out there. (ps since its now generic, the price is way down ....)Good luck !",willie

I am currently on day 5, my skin has stopped forming layers about 90% but still red and small patches here and there. From the time I got the shot, I have only felt low energy and low appetite. No serious side effects. I must add before going on methotrexate, you should start eating healthier and detox the body the best you can for a month prior to going on methotrexate. If you don't you are doing more harm than good because your immune system is going to sleep mode and if you got a load of junk and bad bacteria left they will just take over.",Johnny from Canada
