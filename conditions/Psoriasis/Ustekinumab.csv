0,Ustekinumab,Psoriasis,9.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"November 20, 2021",0,"Stelara (ustekinumab):I am a 60-year-old male, I began to acquire plaque psoriasis in 2005 beginning with scalp and soon followed by elbows up to my lower forearms. For years I tried every cream and potion available and it did little or nothing to help with it or slow down the growth. I did get a bit of scalp relief for a few years from Talclonex Suspension but it was removed from My insurance allowable drugs list last year. This, and the fact that it was now covering 20% of my Buttocks, fingernails and lower back prompted me to finally look at a biologic. Stelara has (within 7 weeks and two injections) totally removed psoriasis from my life except for one dime sized spot on my backside. It almost seems to good to be true. The side effects have been some sinus issues within the first week of both injections and some minor joint pain within the first 48 hours of each injection. It has even taken the psoriasis out of the two fingernails that were effected. I only gave it a 9 because of price.",P. From Ohio
1,Ustekinumab,Psoriasis,10.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"September 4, 2021",0,Stelara (ustekinumab):I am a 52 year old female and have had psoriasis since age 8. I’ve tried most things as you all have above from creams to PUVA to Humira. I have had just 2 doses of Stelara after breaking down in my Rheumatology appt and realising that life was so awful that I couldn’t even go out anymore because clothes hurt me. We bought and moved to a house 5 mins from the beach but I stopped going to here too because I was sick of the stares I got. I am 100% psoriasis free and I have only worn shorts since it disappeared! I’m just sad that this wonder drug was not around when I was younger. But I am living my life so happily now and am so grateful,P/head
2,Ustekinumab,Psoriasis,9.0,Taken for 5 to 10 years,"August 27, 2021",0,"Stelara (ustekinumab):This medication was like magic the first time I got it. I've had severe psoriasis on my scalp and ears for the past 10 years. The topical creams, solutions, and shampoos just wouldn't work.  When all other methods failed, my dermatologist recommended a biologic such as Stelara. About 2 weeks after my first dose, I noticed things were clearing up. The second dose was about a month after the first one, and I noticed even more clarity after that one. I've been taking it every 12 weeks since, and I have no more patches in my ears, and only a tiny little bit on my scalp, but it's manageable. I tend to flare up a little bit when it's getting close to the next dose. I would say about week 11 is when I see a little bit more on my scalp than normal, but I know it's because I'm due for my next injection soon. My insurance covers all but about $200, and then the Stelara Savings Card covers the rest, with the exception of $5.  So I only pay $5 for a $27,000 drug that is seriously a miracle worker!",alt14cs
