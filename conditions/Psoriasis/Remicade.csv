0,Remicade,Psoriasis,9.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"September 2, 2021",0,"I have been taking it for 2 1/2 years now for both PsA and psoriasis. Before Remicade I was on Humira and still had about 25-30 percent plaque coverage mostly on my legs and arms. about a week after the first infusion my Psoriasis was almost cleared up. I now only have a tiny bit starting in my ears again, the only side effect I attribute to it is my blood pressure skyrocketed shortly after the first infusion, however, it is under good control with a low dose of Coversyl plus. I hope to remain on Remicade for a long time. My arthritis seems to under control with only minor flares just before infusion.",rlc702
