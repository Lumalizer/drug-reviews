0,Humira,Psoriasis,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"December 13, 2021",0,"Let this be a warning to anyone about to take this drug. This drug can give you permanent MS, Lupus, and neurological conditions like painful peripheral neuropathy. This is not after taking it for years. This is after just 1 or 2 infusions. My son developed painful peripheral neuropathy after only 2 injections of the drug. The drug company and the doctors push this medication. The company will even assign a nurse to help you get started. Once you develop a problem, the company will shut you out. You can no longer even sue this damn company anymore. They legally have everything all tied up. Unless absolutely necessary, do not take this medication. It has ruined my 26 year old son's life. It is worse than poison.",Katie

He was a healthy kid with some psoriasis. OMG, why oh why did we every suggest this medication. He is only 25 and in so much pain now. I feel like a horrible parent for ever suggesting this medication. The course of his life is forever changed. This drug totally disrupted his immune system- PERMANENTLY.- you cannot even sue the company now. They have made sure to cover themselves. DO NOT TAKE THIS DRUG IF AT ALL POSSIBLE>",Forever changed

3,Humira,Psoriasis,10.0,,"January 23, 2021",5,"I have been on Humira biologics since March 2005. Prior to Humira I had systematically gone through all creams, ointments, UVA, UVA, Methotrexate, Cyclosporine and another drug I can't remember. At the time of beginning treatment I was 35% covered across my entire body. After a month, most of the scale had reduced and after a further 3 months most of the redness had gone too. From then on, I had 10 years of no psoriasis, continuing to inject every two-three weeks. Due to a change of address and mix up with hospitals I was without my medication for a year and for 9 months of that year I stayed clear. When I restarted the injections they were not as effective as before but with a little help from a steroid ointment I was clear again and have been since. This product changed my life and I hope others benefit how I have. I'm also so grateful to the NHS that this costs me nothing. Reading reviews online, you realise how expensive these things are elsewhere.",Jeff8246
4,Humira,Psoriasis,3.0,,"December 16, 2019",8,"I was SOOOOO hopeful that Humira would address my psoriasis as well as my RA.  After my third shot (two weeks apart) last summer, I had a SEPTIC ARTHRITIC JOINT INFECTION that has lasted 3-4 months.  I'm still getting over it but at least home and free of home infusion antibiotics.  It's very unusual that this type of infection happens in a ""native"" knee (not as a result of surgery) but it happened and with both arthroscopies and an arthrotomy followed by another open surgery wash-out (that makes 4 operations in two months) cultures were always taken but nothing would grow, thus making it difficult to know what to medicate me with to kill the raging infection.  I am basically walker-bound (and a crutch for stairs).  PLEASE pay attention to the drug warnings.  I had no idea I had a low lying infection - - maybe it came from a try at stem cells a year ago(?), maybe steroid injections to allow me to walk(?), or?????",Septic
5,Humira,Psoriasis,1.0,,"August 5, 2019",29,"I’m sharing this only with the hope that it might help someone else. My daughter was started on Humira  six months ago for psoriasis. Three months in she developed what looked like a very itchy rash over her entire body. After two weeks the rash turned into what looked like psoriasis plaques. Her physician switched her to taltz.  She had some initial clearing, but it came back with a vengeance. Tried  several different types of steroid creams, but the rash continued to cover 90% of her skin  on her arms, legs, and torso. Last evening, with nothing left to lose, I smeared  Vermont’s  bag balm  all over her back, as this was the worst area. This morning when she woke up there was a noticeable (I’d say about 50%) improvement  on her back, with no change to the skin on her extremities.  I do not work for the company that makes the cream, And I’m not trying to sell it to anyone. I only  wish to share our experience.",Concerned mom
6,Humira,Psoriasis,,Taken for 10 years or more,"July 23, 2019",13,"Humira is a powerful drug , I used it successfully for almost 11 years  but about the time the commercial came out about it being successful in patients for over ten years , I had a problem . Well more than a problem it interacted with a BP med . HCTZ , Then they gave me another BP med and I almost died . My face peeled 12 times in a month I was hospitalized and treated for symptoms but was undiagnosed . The MD's were clueless. It took me a couple of years to figure out what the trigger was and I realized finally that it was the BP med. Word of caution if you use a Biologic check out the contraindications for use with a BP med , or other meds. These are probably not known in the more recent meds.  ( NO Studies ) . Stelara , Otezla , Cosyntex , All pointless .Humira works but is dangerous . Its a broad spectrum Biologic and hits a lot of systems in the body . Stelara was billed as a pinpoint and highly successful med but the MD's told me they did not see the same results in practice.",g

8,Humira,Psoriasis,3.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"July 15, 2019",9,"Probably because I have a strong fight-back immune system while still being young, I really don’t enjoy such treatment that worked at first and then backfired like anything. I’m really looking for a treatment than can last long but Humira was not the choice for me and I don’t know what to do now. After trying all pills, lighting treatment, herbal showering, and cream (most of the time I’m lazy to apply), I’m switched to Humira for a goal of 100% clearance. It worked so fast like in 6 weeks and then kept for a year and a half but all of sudden all the redness, rashes, and scales came back just like what it was only in 2 weeks and it terrifies me. Everytime I did the shot, it stopped and got better for 2 or 3 days, but the plaques are just madly itchy... Hope people got prepared for the after effects around the injection area and your body system; also another side-effect to me is extreme fatigue over a year.",PPT
9,Humira,Psoriasis,1.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"July 3, 2019",14,"I fully believe this is a wonderful drug for psoriasis, Crohn's and other diseases; however, it isn't helping me! I have had psoriasis for over 10 years. I was prescriped Humira and was so excited that I would finally get this under control. The first two weeks, my psoriasis seemed to be getting a little better. I was very hopeful. Unfortunately, after the first two weeks, my psoriasis got worse! Everything flared up, scales everywhere and itching like mad. At my 1 month checkup my Doctor told me to continue the medicine and use Enstilar to get it under control. By month 2 I was ready to give up on this medicine. I will be asking my Doctor at my appointment to switch me. This is just my story with Humira but I still feel it is a great medicine for some, just not me.  :(",EB
10,Humira,Psoriasis,10.0,,"June 24, 2019",12,"Humira has changed my life I started from the beginning when it all kicked off the only worry I got is now at the moment I’m suffering from a tight throat pains an numbness up my side also felt something burst in side ( hip to groin ) I’ve tried asking for help with this at my doctors and the Humira after care team and all I get is  ""in two weeks we can see you"" . Before I started this my Doctor said to me ""if there’s any problems pick up the phone"" and  I believed him. But as for after care now since he’s left everything up  to me. I’m worried  it is the first time I’ve rang with a problem I can't handle and they tell me to hold on for two weeks.  I'm having a good and bad experience, so  I've decided to price up private  to try and see if I can get the help I need that way",Jason davies
11,Humira,Psoriasis,9.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"March 7, 2019",14,"When I was 29 I noticed a rash on my groin that grew slowly.  Doctors prescribed topical antibiotics.  Self medicated with OTC cortisone for almost 10 yrs.  Then rashes began spreading to other areas of my body.  Managed for a bit with cortisone creams, coal tar, etc.  At that point I was pretty sure it was psoriasis.  At 38 I finally went to a dermatologist and he confirmed.  Started me on tacrolimus/pimecrolimus for sensitive areas and topical steroids for all others.  That helped keep the scaling from being too bad, but plaques continued to spread.  He upped the strength of the topical steroids to no avail.  Finally, at 40 yrs old, doctor prescribed Humira and I had 100% clearance within 3 months.  Unfortunately, the plaques are beginning to appear again.  Doctor said to start with topical steroids again.  I may ask to try another biologic with a different target like IL-17 or IL-23 (Taltz, Cosentyx or Stelara) before I become completely resistant to TNF blockers.",jrock
12,Humira,Psoriasis,10.0,Taken for 5 to 10 years,"March 2, 2019",19,"I have been on this drug for close to 8 years now.  Humira has done a fantastic job for me. Personally, when I began I was at close to 40% coverage on my body with countless tiny spots almost everywhere.  Within 4 months, I was down to only quarter sized spots on my knees and elbows.  Currently I only have one very small spot on one knee.  It has been a fantastic drug.",Q
13,Humira,Psoriasis,7.0,,"January 23, 2019",11,"I have been on Humira for 4 years now & I can't say enough about its ability to clear my skin & help my joint pain. I have had psoriasis since I was 5 years old, am 23 now. I tried creams, steroids, and light treatments for about a year in high school. Starting Humira it was 4 months to clear skin (90%), which was amazing since I hadn't had clear skin like this since before I could remember. Negative side effects include unexplained headaches, nausea, and when I get sick it is always very bad, meaning the flu becomes a whole week+ of severe symptoms. Something else I deal with are painful injections and pain at the injection site. (Tips) Try massaging your thigh first and numb it with ice, also let your meds warm a little for 10 minutes. Overall, despite the cons, I really love being able to wear anything I want and Humira is worth it for me!",Em

Repeated visits to Dr's to have them I'm crazy, and odd.. I spent so much on medical bills. Chiropractor, Holistic Chiropractor, Regular Dr, Sports Dr's.    I kept asking if it was the Humira injections causing this. I was told no way that's not possible. Well I decided to take the shot in the other hip and low and behold, I had pain full force. I stopped completely. Went to my Dermatologist and explained what had been going on. She looked at me and said I have 3 other patients going thru the exact same thing!! 3 months later and I'm on Otezla, ;( my back hurts again, daily headaches, and feel so tired every day!

17,Humira,Psoriasis,10.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"August 9, 2018",18,It's a miracle drug as far as I'm concerned.  I've had psoriasis since I was 13 and I'm not 53.   I was so bad at one point that 60% - 70% of my body was covered in scales.   I started on Humira 4-5 years ago and I'm now 98% clear.

18,Humira,Psoriasis,8.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"July 26, 2018",17,"I have been on Humira for about two years and it has worked great at clearing up my Psoriasis. It cleared up my skin and nails.  I had also tried just about every other treatment. I don't like taking medicine in general but decided I needed to do something after suffering for over 25 years.  I do often feel tired and have gotten sick more often and I think it is due to the Humira. I also have two young kids that bring home everything from school so that probably doesn't help. I weigh the benefits of clear skin vs the side effects. I have stopped taking it over the summer months when my psoriasis wasn't as bad and it was about 5 months before it came back. Then I started the injections again. I know you are not supposed to stop and start but my body was just feeling so fatigued I thought I needed a break. In conclusion, for me the side effects are real but I can finally wear shorts and swim with my kids without feeling embarrassed.",Dude

I didn’t anticipate such drastic results and certainly not this quick. No side effects. I'm using  the self injection pen and no prior experience with one before. A nurse came out and helped me get familiar with it. The hardest part in all of it has been actually pushing the button on the injection. It’s just a mental thing.  The injection is a slight sting, like a fire ant. Only last a few seconds while the medicine is being injected. Zero soreness, redness or pain after it’s done. I’m hoping this continues to work for me. I’ve had this all over since 18 months (37 years). As a child I had injections every week in my thigh & under my nails, light therapy and topical medicine. Every night my mom would take a comb and pull the plaques open on my scalp to put the medicine on. I’d wake up with dried blood in my hair.  For the first time in my life I feel normal.",Kp

I had to teach myself how to walk again with physical therapy it took 30 minutes just to walk three houses down and back. I went back to the Dr who said in rare cases it can cause MS like symptoms and I was very saddened to be removed from this medicine. Within weeks I was back to normal. But here's the kicker I had plaque psoriasis on about 30 percent of my body when I started Humira. 2 yrs later I am covered in about 90 percent n it has this since age 11! SAD!!,love hate Humira

I did creams, Enbrel for 2 years, now Humira for about 6 months.  Initially it worsened then got way better.  Now, I have been off the Humira for over 3 months and nothing has come back.  My skin is 99% better.  I had over 50% coverage on my body and it was unsightly, painful, and nasty.  Now it's all gone.  At this point in time I have to say: this stuff is remarkable.",minch77

111,Humira,Psoriasis,9.0,,"June 12, 2008",67,"I have tried all drugs out there,and almost gave up. Enbrel was good but I developed resistance after about 2 years of use. Humira showed a marked clearance of my severe psoriases within one month of use. I have never felt this good after 30 years of struggle. Administration of the injection is also convenient, once every other week.",Anonymous
