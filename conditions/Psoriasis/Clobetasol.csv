0,Clobetasol,Psoriasis,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"October 22, 2021",0,"I have had scalp psoriasis for 3 years but was only diagnosed a month ago.   I tried self help treatments prior to being diagnosed with no success. My doctor prescribed Clobetasol shampoo which I was reluctant to purchase due to the extreme cost for a 2 week supply; however, I did purchase the product because my condition was worsening. I thought at this price for 4 ounces, it has to be good. I used the shampoo according to my doctor's  directions, once a day for 2 weeks. My plan was if my condition slightly improved, I would purchase another bottle to use for an additional 2 weeks, 4 weeks being the maximum amount of time to use the product.  Unfortunately, it did absolutely nothing to improve my scalp condition.  I will seek the advice of a dermatologist and in the meantime, I will begin using Nizoral shampoo to see if it might have a positive effect. I did not know until reading the reviews published here that this is an incurable condition.",Cka

In 2 years on Clobex on and off - my coverage went from 5% to 30% - started becoming aggressive and not responding to clobex on my legs. BEWARE of this medication.

Through the years I've tried many creams and nothing helped.  Recently I tried this medication and in a couple of days my skin cleared completely.  I used it a few days and then went a week without it and it seemed like it was healed.  Eventually I felt some itching and used it again.  Now I use it once every four or five days just in case and I've been completely clear.  The unknown is that although several doctors told me it was psoriasis, the most recent doctor said it could be some kind of dermatitis since it has always stayed in the same place affecting only one leg.

It starts out with bumps under the skin and in 2-4 days they become big water filled blisters that are the size of a dime, most of them are the size of a quarter and the largest one I had was bigger than a half dollar.

27,Clobetasol,Psoriasis,7.0,,"December 1, 2015",40,"So like many people here I have had good results but there are a few things to point out.   This is s very potent steroid and needs to be used for short periods of time.   It's meant to knock down a flare up but is not s good long term choice.   It will thin the skin and cause stretch marks.   I know from experience.   Also the more you use it the less effective it becomes and overuse can cause cushings disease.   So...

I probably had 1,000 spots on my legs, a few spots on my scalp and arms and chest, but my legs were horrible. My doctor gave me some samples of Clobex spray and after 1 week my Psoriasis is 80% gone. He said I need to go in a mega tan bed for 15 minutes and take 8,000 IU of Vitamin D3 and take zinc, so doing all that I am so thrilled with the results. I would recommend Clobex to anyone - pricey but so worth it.",indygoblu

According to my dermalogist, I had a severe case of psoriasis on the hands, feet, knees and elbows a total of 7% of my body area.  All cleared up except the front of the feet within 3 weeks, so down to 2.5% in 6 weeks.  The doctor had explained that it would take longer on the feet and I'm ok with it... I love the results... the price however is another story.  I don't have insurance and one bottle of the spray is $400  help!!!",tasha11
