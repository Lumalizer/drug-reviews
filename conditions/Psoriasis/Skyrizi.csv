0,Skyrizi,Psoriasis,10,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"March 18, 2022",0,"Went into Skyrizi failing every other biologic systematic you could think of before it trying to treat plaque psoriasis and arthritis for 12 years, although it cannot treat the PSA for more than a month per loading dose, Skyrizi not only cleared my skin quicker than the competitors, it also didn't have a severe effect on my existing health conditions unlike the rest. In fact I noticed some of those other conditions improve temporarily, have also been able to enjoy a flexible diet and other bad habits without a single lesion or breakout since starting it, cannot break the effectiveness of this biologic no matter what I eat or drink. I would say based on my experience it is the least risky and most effective thus far and has taught us the IL23 pathway is critical to treating many other autoimmune diseases",mmikeman
1,Skyrizi,Psoriasis,10,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"March 10, 2022",0,I’ve had psoriasis since I was 8 years old and have done every topical recommendation under the sun. I was on otezla for a few years. Initially it worked well but I had a lot of side effects and then it stopped working at all. I started skyrizi a year ago and cannot be happier. My scalp is clear for the first time in 24 years and all the visual plaques on my skin has resolved. I had no side effects from starting it but have gotten two UTIs (which I have never had before) since being on it.,Skyrizi

The patches on my arms and legs are starting to dissipate after only 4 days.",Daniel

5,Skyrizi,Psoriasis,1,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"August 8, 2020",12,"this drug after close to 18months or more made no difference in low back guttate psoriasis dermatitis is which appeared as an allergic reaction after bad food and another drug. I've been given many drugs in the same class: enbrel humira skyrizi otezla consentyx they're all equally ineffective and only made my skin hurt. The dermatitis the MD was at war with was not my normal immune system over reacting no, The allergic reaction was to another drug or a bacteria in food. The only thing that puts the low back dermatitis closest to get guttate psoriasis calm down is two weeks of water fasting and avoiding the other mess provoking breakout.",nono
