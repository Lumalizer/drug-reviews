0,Tazorac,Psoriasis,7,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"May 28, 2018",9,Applied to my plaque psoriasis daily . At first my skin got super irritated raw and started to crack open . After this initial bad reaction it started to heal and progressively clear . The amazing part is that the plaque psoriasis did not immediately return at that location like it does when you discontinue the use of other topicals . To me the pain is worth the gain. It is by no means a pleasant treatment but it's effective.,Larry
1,Tazorac,Psoriasis,9,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"September 16, 2016",11,"I apply it all over my face after washing and patting dry. I keep it on overnight, don't wash it off, and keep it on until the next night I shower. I do this three days in a row, and then I do this routine every other day for about 2 months. This clears up my dermatitis for 2-3 months, at which point, I start my routine all over. Winter months are a battle with the irritation, peeling, and redness, but that's when I have to be most aggressive with treatment. When my skin gets to the point where its super itchy, raw and red, I use benedryl lotion and it works like a charm. I love this product. My skin looks fantastic. Not only is it really great at clearing up my skin, it's also great at diminishing fine lines.",Olpimple
