0,Methylprednisolone,Psoriasis,9,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"July 22, 2021",0,"Methylpredisolone is my miracle drug. Because of gout, I was prescribed this medication and found I benefited by the clearing of my psoriasis plaque on my feet also. In addition, it helped with my back and neck pain. Only side effect is thinning skin. It helps me to eliminate the gout pain, clears the plaque, and eases back pain. But it is a temporary fix as I can't use it continuously/permanently.",CAS
