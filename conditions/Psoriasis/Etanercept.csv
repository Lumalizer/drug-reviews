0,Etanercept,Psoriasis,9.0,,"August 21, 2012",15,Enbrel (etanercept):I was so glad when my doctor started me on the Enbrel shots. I wasn't sure it would work considering my body was totally covered.  Although it started in my head but it wasn't long before it made it's way all over my body. I started the shots in Aug/2008 and by Nov/2008 I didn't look like anything was ever wrong with my skin.,Anonymous

2,Etanercept,Psoriasis,10.0,,"January 5, 2012",15,"Enbrel (etanercept):I have been on this medicine for just over a year now and I call it my 'life saver'. I was covered to 90% of my body and was getting to the point of not going out anymore. Within a couple of months the change was so noticeable that my friends and family were noticing and commenting on how good I was looking.  This past fall, I joined an aqua-fit group. I've had absolutely no side effects, that is except for better self-confidence, better outlook, more outgoing and so much happier.",One Happy Lady

4,Etanercept,Psoriasis,,,"May 5, 2011",10,"Enbrel (etanercept):I am 53 year old female having psoriasis since I was about 20. I started Enbrel 5 months ago and after switching from the autoject pen to the powder you have to mix with sterile water made the shot painless, the preservative burns! I noticed a big difference in about 5 weeks and was totally clear everywhere until just recently. Now I am getting some small eruptions in the usual places. I work in a hospital and have never had issues with illness due to my immune system being compromised so I am happy and plan on wearing shorts this summer for the first time in a very long time.",razzyg1
5,Etanercept,Psoriasis,10.0,,"May 3, 2011",4,"Enbrel (etanercept):annabamma-  you need to PROVE beyond a shadow of a doubt that her psoriasis is debilitating.  It must be SEVERE for them to cover the cost of the medicine.  Moderate just wont cut it, it didn't in my case.  I know its easier said than done but I let my skin get horrifically bad just to prove to my insurance that it should be covered.  TAKE PICTURES and see several dermatologists until one considers it a MAJOR problem.  Hope that helps.",SteveRoland

8,Etanercept,Psoriasis,,,"August 20, 2010",6,"Enbrel (etanercept):I have used Enbral now for 4 months. This has worked for me for palm/plantar psoriasis in the following ways:-reduced the feeling of burning under the skin-reduced inflammation and leg swelling- I now wear 7 shoe size instead of 7.5-has not fully taken the psoriasis away, but keeps it under control- I can wear sandals-I have only minimal skin issues-on palms-minor itching- I wear vinyl gloves at night with Eletone cream on my hands. In two consecutive days, patches are 80% better-I still flare in cycles, but only minor areas on my palms and parts of both feetI have previously tried Humira, Stelara and topicals.I recommend Enbrel, but realize that you may need to go through all of the medications to see which will work.",Gwynie1
9,Etanercept,Psoriasis,1.0,,"August 18, 2010",7,"Enbrel (etanercept):I have had psoriasis for only about five years now, and seeing a dermatologist for four years. We tried everything and then he suggested we try Enbrel. I used it for a total of 7 months with absolutely no results, in fact it spread more. I was desperate to get rid of this as both calves were covered and it was painful. Finally we went to Methotrexate and it worked almost immediately! I take only 4 pills weekly now and it is working like a dream.",Barbara421
10,Etanercept,Psoriasis,9.0,,"August 5, 2010",9,Enbrel (etanercept):I have been on Enbrel for 7 years and I have to tell you it is awesome.  I am able to do things that I never thought possible again.  I have had no side effects and I only have to take a shot every 3-4 weeks to have it be effective.  I will keep my fingers crossed that none of those side effects show up.,Anonymous
11,Etanercept,Psoriasis,9.0,,"July 21, 2010",12,Enbrel (etanercept):I have had Psoriasis since puberty and for lack of a better term it was a living hell.  It covered 80% of my body.  I started Enbrel 4 years ago and I cleared up drastically within the first month. It was a miracle.  Only side effect I encountered was during my blood work check ups my doctor noticed my ANA was high which could indicate drug induced lupus so we kept a close eye on that.  I am no longer on Enbrel because I got Pneumonia last summer and couldn't take it while sick and I never broke out the whole time I was off it. So they saw no need to go back on it.  Since then I have been experiencing break outs again and wish to go back on but its not a large enough percentage covering my body to start it up again.,Anonymous
12,Etanercept,Psoriasis,10.0,,"March 3, 2010",31,"Enbrel (etanercept):I have been using Enbrel for about 2 yrs now and have been living a life that I never thought possible.  I am active both socially and athletically (lacrosse) I would not have been able to do any of these things without Enbrel.  I find this website to be a great avenue to post my thoughts and feeling about this miraculous drug.  However expensive it may seem this will undoubtedly CHANGE YOUR LIFE. I was on the verge of suicide every time I looked in the mirror.  I was horrified at how my body had mutated into an unrecognizable state.

13,Etanercept,Psoriasis,5.0,,"January 5, 2010",21,"Enbrel (etanercept):I have tried Enbrel for 9 months and it worked great for both my psoriasis and the arthritis. BUT last July I stopped using it because I wanted to get my wife pregnant. And to be sure there was no side effect by using it. And since I stopped using it, the psoriasis and arthritis have come back massively and seems worse then ever. This is a really bad side effect. Also I have got some very weird infections/viruses, etc. that healthy people normally don't get. I have had Zoster Shingles, and Pavovirus. These are immune related illnesses and they must have come because of the lowered immune system. ",Enbrel addict

I have the arthritis also, and since I quit due to cost, it seems to have come back 100 worse than before the Enbrel.

15,Etanercept,Psoriasis,8.0,,"October 28, 2009",9,"Enbrel (etanercept):In 2005 after 20  yrs with plaque psoriasis I began to experience severe body aches & pains. My dermatologist recommended Enbrel to treat both Psoriatic Arthritis and plaque psoriasis. I started it in September 2005.  After 6-8 wks I had remarkable results, aches and pains ceased and psoriasis plaques cleared.  In May 09 during a routine follow-up w/ my dermatologist I complained of fatigue and other issues.  They assumed it was not related to the Enbrel. Instead intense Thyroid testing was recommended.  I was diagnosed with various thyroid nodules, biopsy showed suspicious cells.  My entire thyroid was removed in September 09 - No Cancer-hooray!  Very Scared to resume Enbrel after 8 wks but feeling desperate.  Aside from the cancer scare, drug has worked for me!",Me and Enbrel

I am 99% clear. I have three tiny patches left. I buy black clothes now. I no longer look over my shoulder to see if I am flaking and I am considering getting rid of my bangs after 40 years because I can! Honestly, if you have psoriasis and a prescription plan, you MUST try this. My toe nails are almost clear. I am thinking by Christmas I will be able to wear open toed shoes. Seriously, my husband is self employed and we pay our own benefits and he and I agreed, despite the expense, the Enbrel is worth it. I would be devastated if they took it away from me now.",Anonymous

I am in week five and the psoriasis on my stomach, which was the most severe, are nearly gone. My rear end is clear. My scalp looks better. I have many, many small ones on my legs and they aren't as red or as thick. My elbows still have psoriasis but not as thick. The only side effect I can see is that my foot twitches every once in a while and I can't honestly say it is the medication. I LOVE this. Only con, in the beginning the injection hurt.",Anonymous

22,Etanercept,Psoriasis,6.0,,"March 22, 2009",20,"Enbrel (etanercept):I used Enbrel for Psoriasis for a little over 2 years. I was eager to try something that worked since at that time, nothing did. It worked and continued to work. It was VERY expensive and good thing I had insurance to cover it, or I would be back at square one, feeling and looking terrible. The needle is massive and hurts but it was worth it 100%. After those 2 years, Enbrel started to NOT work and my doctors upped my dosage 3 or 4 times and finally I had to be switched since it just did not work anymore. I researched it and I did read that after X amount of times some patients can and will become immune to the drug. This is what happened to me. I was devastated.

As with other medications of this sort, there is no guaranteee of 100% effectiveness, and also the results diminish with time. I am personally very very thankful that I was able to use the enbrel pre-filled syringes.",rmjjnana
