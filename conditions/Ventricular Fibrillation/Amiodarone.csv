0,Amiodarone,Ventricular Fibrillation,1.0,Taken for 10 years or more,"February 7, 2022",0,"*****WARNING******This drug, is like walking through a NUCLEAR WAR ZONE! The side effects were over the top, from the standpoint all the ones listed on Drug.com I experienced. The worst was the rash, neuropathy etc. Over the years, the occurrences became overwhelming and the doctor pretty much said, grin and bear it! Fortunately, My heart rebounded to pretty much normal functioning..ejection fraction of 17 to 60’s…It is hard to say, if the drug helped, but I do know the SIDE EFFECTS WERE BRUTAL!  Word of Advise! Challenge your Doctor and Ask Questions.",Jay
1,Amiodarone,Ventricular Fibrillation,1.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"December 25, 2021",1,"My husband was on amiodarone to prevent defibrillator from going off. His initial dosages were quite high for one week, then levels tapered down. After six weeks of relative healthiness, we went on Caribbean cruise. Two days into cruise he was very short of breath, and at times incoherent.  Ship doctor’s findings were bilateral pulmonary infiltration, O2 sat of 50%, and pO2 level of 55. In St.Maarten hospital intensive care. Testing for virus and bacteria negative. A pulmonologist researched his meds. Amiodarone is culprit. It is taking weeks to leave his body. He is  still on CPAP, sats are at 94% but he is getting 50% O2 at 4 liters. When we can finally fly back to US, I have every intention of seeking medico-legal assistance. I don't think he will ever recover, need O2 for rest of his life.  I see many attorneys taking on these cases, with some class action occurring. THIS DRUG NEEDS TO BE REMOVED FROM MARKET.",Garbos Mom

9,Amiodarone,Ventricular Fibrillation,8.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"August 28, 2016",39,"Began Nexterone (amiodarone) IV in the hospital.   I was taken off of it, but went into afib again, so they reinstated it.  Then they started me on it orally, again went into afib so they put me back on the IV.   Was discharged (after 4 weeks in the hospital intensive care ward for tachycardia/afib; sepsis; pneumonia; pancreatitis, MRSA, and then renal failure most likely as a result of all the antibiotics/meds for every thing else).  Taking 200 mgs per day and heart rate has been stable for the three weeks I've been out of the hospital (and on dialysis 3 days per week).   The potential side effects (lung scarring, liver and thyroid issues, and eyesight issues-which I think I am already developing) are extremely scary.  Would like to DC .",I'm not Tachy

13,Amiodarone,Ventricular Fibrillation,1.0,,"August 13, 2009",60,"Three weeks after commencing amiodarone I had developed an itchy skin rash (under clothing, not photosensitive) which started below my knees, and spread over my whole body within eight weeks. At that time I wore a halter monitor to assess rhythm and my condition was worse than when I was on other medicines. The side effects were pronounced, the results poor, at least in my case.",Anonymous
