1,Amitriptyline,Chronic Myofascial Pain,1.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"October 4, 2019",17,"Endep (amitriptyline):This medication should not be taken lightly. It has some terrible side effects I’m taking this to help with my burning mouth syndrome (BMS) which has bought on anxiety.  If it wasn’t for my BMS I would never take Endep. People should be aware of the side effects this medication can have as it’s made me sick, once I take the medication any higher than 75mg I know the side effects will come on (shortness of breathe, chills etc) I’ve woken up many of nights in chills and fever in my chest and I’ve taken myself to hospital as I thought I was going to die. The latest I’ve woken up with tremors and taken by ambulance to hospital.",Son

3,Amitriptyline,Chronic Myofascial Pain,8.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"February 24, 2018",17,"Hi there. Just want to share my experience I hope this helps people. I suffer with facial pain and migraines. I have been taking 10mg of amitriptyline for 2 and a half yrs now. I am used to this dose now though my anxiety has become worse so having spoken to my doctor I am upping the dose to 20mg, taking each before bed every night. This medicine has helped me a huge amount with my facial pain and migraine. Wondered if anyone can give me any advice on the upping dose of this?",Chloe
4,Amitriptyline,Chronic Myofascial Pain,10.0,,"September 30, 2017",19,"I take Amitriptyline with carbamazepine. I was diagnosed with trigeminal neuralgia type 2. I take Amitriptyline 10-30 mg in the evening and its the only thing that has relieved me of the shocking pain I feel and the end of my jaw. At first I felt immense drowsiness, but as my body got used to the drug and that side effect went away. The pain is gone now, I am able to eat, drink and shower without the pain. It's been great. I don't have any side effects.",Anonymous
5,Amitriptyline,Chronic Myofascial Pain,10.0,,"June 27, 2017",18,"I started on 10mg for acute myofascial pain and bursitis in both hips it absolutely changed my life,  Almost all pain has stopped unless I exacerbate the bursitis with a 10 mile walk !  After about 4 years I had to increase the dossage to 20mg as I was beginning to notice I was experiencing pain again but the increased dosage has rendered me almost pain free again.  I could not cope now without it although I do worry about being so reliant on drugs for pain relief the side affects are negligible as I take dose before bedtime so do not experience undue fatigue.",shrodycat3
6,Amitriptyline,Chronic Myofascial Pain,,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"June 13, 2017",14,Elavil (amitriptyline):Been taking for pain in right side of my face. 1st month I would wake up like a Zombie now after 6 months I am fine. Pills don't work the same for everyone.,losier
7,Amitriptyline,Chronic Myofascial Pain,7.0,,"January 11, 2016",49,Started taking this for chronic myofacial pain. At only 10 mg it's hard to notice a big difference in pain reduction but has definitely made it more tolerable. A little groggy at first and dry mouth but goes away within a few weeks. Absolutely no weight gain although I did feel early on I was really craving carbs. If you stay disciplined those cravings will go away . I haven't gained even 1lb and have been on it for over a year.,TaylorTyler
