0,Cyclobenzaprine,Chronic Myofascial Pain,8.0,,"June 2, 2021",4,"I’m a licensed massage therapist with chronic pain and, when the pain & tension goes on for too long, I end up with painful muscle spasms as well. Flexeril (10mg) has helped me immensely. I only take it a couple hours before bed, often along with 600-800mg of ibuprofen. This seems to help reduce the pain as well as relaxing my body & inducing drowsiness so I can get a restful night’s sleep and wake up feeling better. I will say that I have taken this during the day, and while it doesn’t always make me drowsy, if you’re planning to use it during the day, PLEASE try this while you’re at home and in a safe place… Everyone is different, but while I’m still cognizant whilst taking it, it can induce intense drowsiness to the point where I would never consider being in a vulnerable position or getting behind the wheel of a vehicle.",RandomLMT
1,Cyclobenzaprine,Chronic Myofascial Pain,2.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"February 20, 2021",2,"My neurologist put me on this for well over a year.   Everything was fine until I was faced with idiopathic marrow edema and muscle problems with my pelvic floor.   Once I stopped taking it I experienced the worst nerve pain in all my joints and extremities.   The pain has been constantly cycling between joint and muscle pain to debilitating head and neck pains.  No one knows what to do, I'm suffering.",Dave
2,Cyclobenzaprine,Chronic Myofascial Pain,1.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"September 22, 2020",4,"Honestly, I don’t feel any better after taking cyclobenzaprine. I have chronic widespread tense tight muscles that spasm a lot. Pretty painful and makes sleep super difficult. But this drug has never helped. Doesn’t even make me drowsy or help sleep.",Ian
3,Cyclobenzaprine,Chronic Myofascial Pain,5.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"September 3, 2020",3,I took this medicine cyclobenzaprine for years for jaw issues and it really helped. It also got me into a deeper sleep which was great. Unfortunately it caused muscle weakness in my arms and hands and had to have carpal tunnel surgery on both hands and surgery for two trigger thumbs and one trigger finger. This is a rare side theft that I have seen posted online but several doctors said they never heard of that. I am doing well now and have retrained muscle in my hands and arms again. When it warns not to take long term there is a reason for that. You can't believe what the doctors say. Get off this medicine now.,Yvonne
4,Cyclobenzaprine,Chronic Myofascial Pain,9.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"April 1, 2020",41,"Hello All,I was prescribed  cyclobenzaprine for the first time 12 years ago after a neck injury. Made me really drowsy and helped me sleep for hours and hours.  I was 20 back then so I could afford it on days I didn't have college. Now 32 with 2 small kids and some nerve damage and degenerative arthritis on one shoulder, My Dr prescribed again.  Decided to give it another chance.   I take 5mg tab which helps me relax my mind and face muscles (For some reason I do not relax while I sleep).  I wake up a little drowsy but nothing a cup of coffee wont fix.   I take right before bed and works around 15-20 mins after taking.  Hope this helps anyone out there.",Emelyn G
5,Cyclobenzaprine,Chronic Myofascial Pain,3.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"March 24, 2020",12,"cyclobenzaprine provides help with sleep, but it did nothing for my chronic muscle spasticity. But even for sleep, the results are inconsistent. Sometimes it would help me sleep through the night, but other times I got no sedation. But it *always* left me feeling hungover the next day. So, the benefits for sleep are decent, but no help with actually relaxing my muscles.",dfa
6,Cyclobenzaprine,Chronic Myofascial Pain,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"August 31, 2019",7,"I have constant muscle tension in my neck, shoulders and back as well as large muscle knots in these areas that never seem to dissipate, even with monthly professional massages along with regular at home stretching and massaging. 6 weeks of physical therapy did nothing either. I always feel uncomfortable so my doctor prescribed 10 mg of Cyclobenzaprine. She also stated to take it at night as it may help me sleep as I have a hard time falling asleep so it would work as a 2 for 1. This does absolutely nothing for me. I feel no difference in my muscle tension and I don’t get tired at all from it. I have a friend who was prescribed the same dosage for pretty much the same reason and it does nothing for her either. But I know others who take it and it helps their muscle/pain issues and knocks them right out. Not sure what makes it work for some and not others.",D
7,Cyclobenzaprine,Chronic Myofascial Pain,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"September 22, 2018",8,"While this medication helped with my chronic myofascial and muscle spasms 100%; after about 1 weeks of taking it twice daily I started having horrid side effects.  Numbness and tingling in my arms and fingers, rapid heart rate,  palpitations,  hot and cold flashes, tremors and high anxiety.  I thought I was going crazy or about to have a heart attack.  These are the very rare side effects of this med, I wish I hadn't experienced them because of the relief I got in my back.",Anonymous
8,Cyclobenzaprine,Chronic Myofascial Pain,3.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"January 4, 2018",7,The use of this medication long term has diminished my ability to do much physical work. My muscles hurt a lot. Prescribed by the VA doctors. I'm 68 years old!,vetairborne
9,Cyclobenzaprine,Chronic Myofascial Pain,4.0,,"October 9, 2017",3,"I have been on many over the years and found that Soma 350 works best if you take 1-3 (based on your tolerance of course)  at bedtime  to help your muscles feel like muscles again, as apposed to being rigid and having major spasms. and 1 or 2 as needed through your day. Now for tramadol, it is a small help for people with small pains. Like me starting out when I was 24, now I'm 42 and in oh so much worse pain.",Anonymous
10,Cyclobenzaprine,Chronic Myofascial Pain,,,"June 21, 2017",6,"Have a herniated disc in my neck leading to pain in my arm and shoulder blade.  I'm not sure why my doctor prescribed this drug for me, probably because she won't prescribe pain meds.  I have refilled very few of these ongoing prescriptions because the only time it has any effect at all is when the pain gets so bad I take 2 of these and 4 aspirin.  I am surprised to see that this drug is only supposed to be taken for 2 week max.    I have not had any side effects at all but taking 1) 10mg tablet has absolutely no effect at all!",Lee Galen
11,Cyclobenzaprine,Chronic Myofascial Pain,1.0,,"September 24, 2015",7,This drug gave me a stomach ache. I just wanted the side effects to be gone. Didn't take long and my stomach pain was gone. I will try eating when I take the pill again. I have bad hip pain as I have arthritis.,Flicca
12,Cyclobenzaprine,Chronic Myofascial Pain,1.0,,"August 29, 2015",19,"All I felt after taking this pill was drowsy and like my legs had blood pooling in them. I fell asleep shortly after taking it and woke up with just as much back pain as I had the night before. In addition, I've felt like a zombie ever since taking it 20 hours ago. I feel like I'll never be the same again. I feel like I'm underwater and neither my eyes nor my brain can focus on or react to anything. Events are just passing me by and I have no reaction. I don't care about anything, I just want to sleep. This is awful and it didn't even relieve my pain.",never again!!
13,Cyclobenzaprine,Chronic Myofascial Pain,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"January 13, 2014",39,"Have Lumbar tear lots of nerve damage but finally having nerves in back fused, etc. Went from a HIGH 10-7 to WOW 7-4, I have chronic severe PAIN & take 10mg NORCO 5 daily which doesn't relieve at all the constant SPASMS through out my body! You CAN'T SLEEP! body just spasms to where you just can't sleep! I tried a 10 mg cyclobenzaprine, this also knocks me out but WELL WORTH IT; this was the first time I slept for a straight 8hrs  since. I've been unable to find any medications to help till Christmas. I ran short on pain med & started taking 800 mg of ibuprofen (prescription) which is a MIRACLE I FEEL I'VE FINALLY FOUND THE PROPER MIXTURE & I'm able to say I've not been this alive since 2002!",FINALLY 42/now 53
