0,Clonazepam,Chronic Myofascial Pain,8,,"January 4, 2018",7,Starts out great but over time this drug will turn on you. Requires more and more to reach same effects. You will reach tolerance and you either up dose or get off this poison. And getting off is very difficult takes a long time to taper with horrible side affects. No dr warned me about this drug when it comes to long term use. I was on it for 3 years and never abused it just look up benzo withdraw. This drug has ruined 1000s of lives.,Josephga01_1966
