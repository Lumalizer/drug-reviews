0,Octreotide,Small Bowel or Pancreatic Fistula,4,,"September 11, 2014",12,"Sandostatin (octreotide):SMALL BOWEL FISTULA.  Had a hysterectomy and my bowel was cut.  Developed fistula.  Had 2nd surgery by general surgeon and was developed a fistula of the small bowel after 4 resections of the small bowel. Has been a high output fistula through the incision site, at the belly button level.  Octreotide did slow down the fistula output from 1350ml/24 hour period to now just a trickle (a ml or so per day).  On some days the output is zero.  SIDE EFFECTS have been many...burning of the throat, much hair loss, whole body rash including my face and in my hair, nausea and dry heaves.  I was first on 50mcg 3 times per day and that was increased to 100mcg three times per day.  That's when the hair loss and rash started.",SUNNY663
