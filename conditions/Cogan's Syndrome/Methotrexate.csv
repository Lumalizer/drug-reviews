0,Methotrexate,Cogan's Syndrome,4,,"August 17, 2009",7,I have a rare syndrome and I'm on methotrexate and prednisone. I've been taking both for 4 months now and also take another pill 12 hours later due to the side effects from the methotrexate. I'm hoping to get off the predniose and see how the methotrexate will work alone.,Anonymous
