3,Eliquis,Deep Vein Thrombosis Prophylaxis after Knee Replacement Surgery,1,Taken for less than 1 month,"November 30, 2019",36,This medicine  is poison pure and simple. Had a total knee replacement 2 months ago and developed more clots in my right calf.  Taken off plavix for recently placed heart stent and put on Eliquis 2.5 mg morning and night.  Yes I do have hemmorhoids which can bleed (exacerbated by blood thinners) but not as bad as the rectal bleed I experienced 1 hour ago. I am so alarmed that I will pray and continue to take 81mg aspirin until I can talk to doctor on Monday.  The manufacturers of this med deliberately tried to deceive FDA regarding clinical trials results.  And yes doctors ARE paid to prescribe this poison over other similar drugs.,Anonymous
