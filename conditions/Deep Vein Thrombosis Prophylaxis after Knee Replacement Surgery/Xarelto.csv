0,Xarelto,Deep Vein Thrombosis Prophylaxis after Knee Replacement Surgery,,,"July 10, 2021",1,"No not take this drug it does not work.It is a expensive worthless piece of rubbish. I had knee replacement, then I developed blood clots in leg  that happens I guess.Wanted to be on warfarin as blood thinner because it worked for me in the past.My clinic wanted me on xarelto, it did not work and  I had several small strokes while on xareltoFollow the money",Pete
1,Xarelto,Deep Vein Thrombosis Prophylaxis after Knee Replacement Surgery,1.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"August 26, 2018",16,"Was on eliquis. Awful drug. Was on it 6 weeks and my urine got VERY rank. after 2 and half months woke up one night and my heart was vibrating, jaw and arm pain. It stopped after 5 min. It occurred  2 to 5 times a day  for 5 days Made Dr appointment and I cut pills to 1 a day. Dr put me on Xarelto.  Still have the bad urine smell.  Had a few days of heart episodes but now it seems to be better. Have taken 16 pills, one a day. I still have slight tightness and jaw pain occasionally but nothing compared to Eliquis.. I also on Eliquis had sore eyes and very very tired. I am still tired but not as bad. have 2 more months to go. Just wanted to share this with everyone that has to take this  medicine!!",sher
