2,Pantoprazole,Peptic Ulcer,4.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"September 1, 2020",12,"Had terrible heartburn/ nausea that was just making it hard to eat things like a sandwich and it made it hard to get through work cause of the pain. Doctor said I probably had an ulcer. Took pantoprazole and it worked like a miracle, only had a lot of seasickness like I felt dizzy like I was on a boat. Then I went from 2x a day to 1x for like 2 weeks and I started feeling bad again so I stopped. Immediately after I stopped I started getting terrible stomach/ chest pains and now my acid is just abysmal. I think taking it actually left me off worse than when I started. I've never had acid regurgitation before but now I started having it, and I feel so weak :(",Anon

4,Pantoprazole,Peptic Ulcer,9.0,,"August 24, 2019",5,I have been on 40 mg of Protonix for about 17-18 yrs. It has worked wonders ( I have a peptic ulcer that covered my whole stomach) for years and could eat pretty much whatever. Now it's not working as well and wondered y'alls opinion on upping dose or switching to aciphex ( the (ONLY OTHER ONE THAT WORKS) Which is more expensive. I stay nauseated ALOT but have lived in a very stressful situation for awhile. I have medical knowledge- phlebotomy and Alzheimer's hospice care and med aide but I had a nervous breakdown about a year ago and discovered that I'm bipolar and OCD and ADHD and probably some more letters. I am going to go to my doctors but just kind of wanted y'alls opinion,Belli's Nana
5,Pantoprazole,Peptic Ulcer,10.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"August 12, 2019",13,"This medicine helped me so much. It was prescribed to me in June after I got sudden extremely harsh and painful acid reflux accompanied by diarrhea and lost 10 lbs in one week. Couldn't eat without being nauseous, couldn't sleep without my stomach hurting me and waking up to throw up water brash several times. I was in the ER twice for this and that's when I got the prescription. It took around 3 days to control the acid, but I could still feel a slight sting in my stomach for around a week at the time. I got a migraine and was itchy at first...two weeks later my joints started to ache. But then after that I used it for 2 months and now I have stopped. My symptoms are gone! I'm back to normal and can eat/drink what I want. Also, actual symptoms from the medicine seemed to have faded away after 2 weeks and I literally had no reaction to it after.",Dee

Protonix has been my miracle.  If I run out even for a day I'm in so much pain that I can't even walk.   I'm thankful for this medicine",Saved my life
7,Pantoprazole,Peptic Ulcer,9.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"May 25, 2013",59,"Protonix (pantoprazole):Hospitalized January 2012 due to bleeding peptic ulcer which I didn't know I had. GI doc said ulcer was due not to H. pylori but entirely to NSAIDs, the nightly 325 mg aspirin (combination therapy with Plavix for RCA stent, Dec. 2010), to which I added generous doses of Advil (600-800 mg) most days trying to combat muscle pain from simvastatin (current combination of Livalo 2 mg   400 mg CoQ10 = no pain). I am supposed to continue Protonix as long as I am taking aspirin (now only 81 mg).  No visible side effects after a year and a half. I do take magnesium 2-3 times a week due to concern about Protonix knocking mg level down. Also take Caltrate, for the osteoporosis it may cause. Protonix is easy to take, but hard to get off of, I hear.",Neem
8,Pantoprazole,Peptic Ulcer,10.0,,"February 19, 2011",68,"Protonix (pantoprazole):Esophageal ulcer: Had problems off and on with horrible heartburn throughout my teens years until I ended up with an ulcer due to undiagnosed acid reflux and other problems. Was prescribed Protonix and it was the only thing that worked. Since then I have been able to use Tagamet (cimetidine) for every day use, along with watching what I eat, but the Protonix is awesome.",Anonymous
