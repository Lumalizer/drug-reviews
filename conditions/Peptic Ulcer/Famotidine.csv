0,Famotidine,Peptic Ulcer,1,Taken for less than 1 month,"March 15, 2022",0,"The side affects are worse than the pain. I was prescribed 20mg famotine twice a day. I experienced extreme anxiety, sleeplessness, increased heart rate and sweats to the point of almost fainting within 2 days. I stopped taking it. It is just not worth adding all those symptoms on top of stomach pain. I can't believe with all the negative side effects its on the market. I've never experienced such terrible side effects in my life.",Famotine is no
1,Famotidine,Peptic Ulcer,1,Taken for less than 1 month,"February 2, 2022",0,"Reading these reviews are almost hard to believe.  Could Famotidine really be that bad?I'm a doubter & a contrarian, so I figured I'd give it a shot.Wow.  It really is that bad.My stomach problem only got worse.  And the biggest concern were the mental changes it undoubtably caused.  I'm generally very positive & somewhat care free, and that changed within 3 days of starting Famotidine.  I'm 54 years old & have never felt so down.  Into the toilet the rest of the pills went and I was back to normal the next day.Be very cautious with this drug.",Anonymous
2,Famotidine,Peptic Ulcer,4,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"October 20, 2021",2,"Starred taking this for a month 40mg twice a day for gastritis. Noticed a lot of anxiety after taking it. Plus hallucinations, dizziness, feeling tired. Plus shoulder joints and back hurts. Had heart palpitations. Having hot flashes also. I've cut it down to when I need it. I pretty much feel back normal again. Med works just not worth the side effects. PPI's mess with your absorption of food. You don't get all your nutrients. I think it's messed up my gut. Diarrhea more than usual. Wish I never started it.",It's me
3,Famotidine,Peptic Ulcer,10,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"March 10, 2021",4,"My gastroenterologist put me on 40mg, twice per day, for six weeks for my peptic ulcer. I tested negative for h.pylori. My PCP had had me on Nexium which I ended up being allergic to. Horrible headache, fatigue, hives, major bowel issues, and nausea.  Famoridine has changed my life. After two doses I felt better than I had in nearly one year. I had zero side effects which made it easier for me to stay on the 6 week plan. After my six weeks I will remain on it as needed.",Mich614
