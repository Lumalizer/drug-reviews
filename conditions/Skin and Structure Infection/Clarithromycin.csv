0,Clarithromycin,Skin and Structure Infection,5.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"September 8, 2021",0,I am on day four of a seven day course 2 a day morning and late evening for severe ear infection. I was given this medicine at the local hospital. My ear infection was/is severe. The continuous bad taste is just awful. My stomach is very upset and I seem to be practically living in the toilet. I will try and avoid this medicine in the future. You need to be very ill and very brave to take this tablet.,Anonymous
1,Clarithromycin,Skin and Structure Infection,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"July 25, 2021",1,"Was put on clarithromycin 500mg for a horse fly bite that got infected on my back which caused the lymph node in my neck to swell. First day of taking this medication was fine but all went down hill from there, low mood, the most severe tummy pains with lead to the worse case of diarrhoea I’ve ever had in my life, confusion, rate heart and anxiety. I stopped taking after the 3rd day, I would never recommend these tablets to anyone else and I will never take them again! AVOID AVOID AVOID!!",Catherine
2,Clarithromycin,Skin and Structure Infection,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"September 23, 2020",7,"I always get side effects from antibiotics and am allergic to penicillin but I have NEVER experienced anything as bad as this reaction from clarithromycin! Horrible metallic taste in mouth, horrendous stomach pain/cramps/diarrhoea, headache, insomnia, confusion, UTI, and probably worse of all is the depression. I actually feel suicidal and have been hurting myself. I NEVER normally do this. I feel like I have been poisoned and have stopped after 6 tables. I just hope the side effects don’t last, I’m trying to find something to get them out of my system, charcoal maybe??",Running girl
3,Clarithromycin,Skin and Structure Infection,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"September 7, 2020",9,"STAY AWAY FROM THIS DRUG !!I started clarithromycin at a dose of 500mg, first dose was fine no side effects, but after the second dose that’s when it went downhill . Prolonged nausea, intense stomach cramps and the worst diarrhea I’ve experienced in my life. Woke up on the third day and refused to take my dosage before I spoke to my doctor again. Worst drug out there.",J
4,Clarithromycin,Skin and Structure Infection,3.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"September 8, 2019",1,"This was given to me for a lump in my neck which got infected somehow , it's day 6 of a 7 day course and the lump etc are cleaning but I have bad side effects and an awful taste in my mouth :( Dr on Monday as the infection still isn't goal clear and don't want these again I'm allergic to penicillin so not an option with that but I wI'll be asking for a different drug this is disguising and leaves me unwell feeling",Wendz
5,Clarithromycin,Skin and Structure Infection,4.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"January 9, 2019",0,"Not sure how the drug helped the finger infection (Paronychia) which seemed to get worse before getting better (which it might have done on its own).  The only side effect I suffered was the metallic taste in mouth, but I have to say that this was a hideous experience, particularly at night.  Have a constant urge to spit to get rid of the taste (a bit like what happens before you vomit), but the taste comes back almost immediately.  I am not sure if I can make it to the end of the course and I only have a couple more days to go!  ",clarithromycin hater
6,Clarithromycin,Skin and Structure Infection,10.0,,"September 20, 2018",5,"Biaxin XL (clarithromycin):I was on this antibiotic for 7 days. It started clearing up the infection right away, 2 very red and swollen lymph nodes on the right lower armpit. I have never had infection in my lymph nodes, but it was around my bra line, and my immune system is currently weak. I had mild stomach pain the first day but was told to take it with food, I can't take Sulfa drugs because of  severe stomach pain they cause. I had terrible malaise and have more energy now. The infection is cleared up, I took the last dose yesterday. This drug leaves a horrible bitter taste, glue like feeling in the mouth, because I took it before bedtime, 2 tabs at once, I had to gargle right away in a.m. with mouth wash. I'm on heart medication and was not told it can contraindicate, that it can discolor teeth, both are very important to know and I was not informed of this. This drug can be used to treat TB so it is strong, but clearly effective.",Mac
7,Clarithromycin,Skin and Structure Infection,7.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"June 14, 2018",1,"I'm a 22 year old female, I have been suffering from chronic laryngitis for around 2 months so once my life stopped being very busy, I went to the doctors and they put me on Clarithomycin. I got home and took the antibiotic on an empty stomach, worst thing I could do because although I ate cereal straight after,  it made me violently sick and nauseous. I have been on the medication for 3 days now and I have been completely unable to leave the house or do anything productive because I am nauseous, I keep heating up and feeling ravenously hungry after eating just 15 mins ago.",Joanne930219
8,Clarithromycin,Skin and Structure Infection,2.0,,"February 4, 2018",0,I was prescribed Clarithomycin to prevent infection after tonsillectomy. I told the doctor that it makes me feel very sick but she insisted on it rather than prescribing Kefexin which I tolerate really well. I am allergic to penicillin and find that in UK doctors prescribe mysin based antibiotics for anything. Must be the cost as it just doesn't make any sense. Anyway this medicine is making me feel so sick that I cannot take it. I'm recovering from tonsillectomy and the last thing I want is to be sick! Never again!,Mrs SH
9,Clarithromycin,Skin and Structure Infection,,Taken for less than 1 month,"September 27, 2017",2,"After taking this drug I had severe stomach pains and vomiting which required admission to hospital, the problem was that I was also on statins at the same time.",Univ008
10,Clarithromycin,Skin and Structure Infection,5.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"July 27, 2017",4,"Put on this for suspected Diverticulitis after amoxicillin. Day 1 saw no real improvement except a slight lowering of my temperature though still too high and a decrease in my runs to the loo. The downside, the pain. The stomach cramps were bad enough from the diverticulitis but coupled with this became borderline unbearable. Paracodol was the only thing to ease the pain.Day 2 I started noticing the pattern, as well as the vile taste in my mouth, which woke me Repeatedly, and the thirst. I also noticed the nausea hit hard about 10 minutes after the tablet, retching, belching etc. Also came the poops... again... the only think I could do was take paracodol and try to sleep it off. Which brings me to the dreams... vivid, erratic and scary.",$#!t$ and giggles
11,Clarithromycin,Skin and Structure Infection,7.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"June 26, 2016",4,I am taking this for a regular toe infection I can't see the actual impact on my toe due to a bandage so I will talk about the side effects and ease of use. The tablets go down easily with water but remember to have something after to get rid of the after taste. I haven't experienced any major side effects except for a mild dry throat many people are saying they have had a metallic taste and they are right but with my pills (250 mg) I struggle  to find it worse than mildly irritating you don't care if you genuinely need anti-biotics. it is there but when you really need the medication this shouldn't matter,not bad
12,Clarithromycin,Skin and Structure Infection,1.0,,"May 10, 2016",6,"I was prescribed this medication at 500 MG for an ear infection. The side effects were worse than the ear ache. SEVERE diarrhea, headache, body chills and unfortunately my ear still aches. I will be calling my doctor tomorrow for something different. I only took 4 doses and had to stop. I also want to mention I had my gall bladder removed 10 years ago which left me needing to be extremely careful of what I eat- maybe that had something to do with it? I have to agree with most of the comments here- that taste from the meds is horrid. I woke up both nights from the taste! Avoid if possible. I'm allergic to penicillin so I think that's why we tried this.",Sickernow
