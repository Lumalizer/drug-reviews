0,Amoxicillin and Clavulanate,Skin and Structure Infection,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"October 17, 2021",0,I was prescribed this medication to prevent an infection after a root canal. My dose was 825mg I believe twice a day.  Took the first dose but crushed into apple juice because the pills are huge and I have anxiety about swallowing pills. Hour later I was holding back from vomiting.  I blamed it on crushing it up and also doing so on an empty stomach so took my second dose that night and an hour later started to feel dizzy. So started looking up reviews and saw a lot of people saying it caused them panic attacks and anxiety which I already deal with on a daily basis so the next day called my dentist and they switched me to regular amoxicillin which I've never had any issues with.  I thought this was the same as amoxicillin or else I would have never taken it. I am the kind of person who reads up about everything. When I get medicines I'm looking up all the side effects and stuff. Definitely would never take this stuff again.  I've never had any side effects from anything else .,Meep
1,Amoxicillin and Clavulanate,Skin and Structure Infection,1.0,,"August 21, 2021",0,"Took amoxicillin/clavulanate for a minor sinus infection.  Took 1 at night, then 2nd mid-day at 12pm.  It was 875 dosage, which the doc said was a regular dosage.  By 5:30pm, I had severe heart palpitations, then difficulty breathing, then chest pains, pressure on my chest, felt like passing out.  I am 48, and never had such severe reaction to antibiotics.  I had to go to ER and they could not help me because they did not know how to help me.  I suffered in ER.  Went to see an Allergist next day and finally she told me that I had an allergic reaction to Amoxicillin/clavulanate.  By that time I had pins and needles all over my body and had to be put on prednisone which I hope would help me. This drug did some serious nerve damage all over my skin.  My skin is on fire.If you can avoid this drug like a plague, stay away…",Anna
2,Amoxicillin and Clavulanate,Skin and Structure Infection,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"March 16, 2021",2,"Got bit by a friendly, feral cat that thought my finger was food (I stupidly fed it from my hand). Now, I have cats that I play with and they play bite/scratch me all the time. This time, though was a puncture bite. Blood was dripping from my index finger. At first, I thought, I’ll be fine. So I went to work with caution not to use that hand. My mammy also insisted I’d be okay. But something told me this was not going to be okay as the pain and redness/swelling started to kick in less than 24 hours. Any bump or nudge that I touched hurt like anything. So I went to urgent care and they prescribed me this. It’s been 2 days and so far I can almost feel my finger again. Still painful and swollen. I had my first bout of diarrhea today and I have more anxiety than usual. I want to say possibly the disruption of good flora/microbes have been gotten rid of is the source of this. I’m also eating yogurt and some probiotic/prebiotic enriched foods while taking this medication.",Meep
3,Amoxicillin and Clavulanate,Skin and Structure Infection,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"December 2, 2020",3,"I'm someone who generally responds well to medications. However, with Amoxi Clav 875mg, I had very uncomfortable lower abdominal pain, diarrhea and gas started about half way through a 7 day course. Despite taking with food and taking 2 different probiotics twice daily, this medication caused a yeast infection and rectal itching that is still lingering almost 2 weeks after treatment. I've seen 3 separate doctors about side effects just to make sure there isn't something severely wrong with me. Do not take this unless you're desperate!!",M
4,Amoxicillin and Clavulanate,Skin and Structure Infection,3.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"October 6, 2020",4,"Augmentin (amoxicillin / clavulanate):My cat bit my ankle in 5 places. Out of hours GP gave me Augmentin 500/125mg to take 3 times a day. 1st 7 days fine apart from urinating, diarrhoea had to force feed myself as no appetite.7 days nurse came for 2nd time one of the bites fine the others raring to go. It gave me cellulitis. Leg was red, black swollen plus my neck. So GP gave me another 7 days worth. (Had 2 days break). bad diarrhoea/accidents Lying in bed being sick high fever, migraines, feeling so ill. Perspiring, tight chest, palpitations,itchy vagina, became very depressed. I was in a foul mood, memory loss and acid reflux. I thought I had septicaemia. Therefore I only took 3 days of the new pack. By Monday I felt great apart from another bite came up. Nurse dressed and GP put me on Flucloxacillin 500mg and so far so good. Please note these pills are awful. Trying to force food down when you feel so very ill is terrible. Glad it worked for the first week (with slight of the above side effects.) I’d rather give birth!!",Soulsurvivor66

6,Amoxicillin and Clavulanate,Skin and Structure Infection,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"November 1, 2019",6,"I was prescribed amoxicillin/clavulanate for an ear infection. I've been taking it for about 5 days now. My stomach has never hurt this badly and I feel achy all over. It seems to have helped with the ear infection, but I'd rather have the ear infection than deal with the severe stomach issues - cramps, pain, diarrhea, gas, bloating, etc. I'm stopping taking this - I'm glad to know I'm not the only one that had these issues.  I've never had this sort of problem with antibiotics. This stuff even makes my urine smell bad. I've been taking some probiotics to try to fix my stomach. It's not fun having to find a bathroom, sometimes in a severe emergency, while trying to work, drive, etc.. Glad I found this forum. TAKE THIS STUFF WITH GREAT CAUTION - SEEK AN ALTERNATIVE.",Shelly

One of the side effects was it cured me of  my cystic acne. I was about to give up after my dermatologist tried 4 different antibiotics. Two months out and my acne is gone. I went from having penny and quarter spots on my head to nothing. My testosterone injections brings my flare ups out, now I can take a normal dose without not even a hint of acne.

10,Amoxicillin and Clavulanate,Skin and Structure Infection,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"January 19, 2019",4,"Didn't work for me at all for a tooth infection. Took as prescribed for 4 days, ended back up in ER at 3:00 am due to severe swelling near eye/nasal cavity. The ER Dr. said give it more time but I ended up having an emergency dental visit at dentist office. Switched me to regular Penicillin, pain and swelling almost immediately went down. Was gone in 3 days with Penicillin. This stuff was very poor for my tooth abcesses. Didn't help with pain or swelling, just made me feel like garbage for 4 days. Penicillin is definitely the way to go for a Tooth abcesses. No side effects with Penicillin, just relief.",Kenster
11,Amoxicillin and Clavulanate,Skin and Structure Infection,1.0,,"September 26, 2018",2,"I was prescribed Augmentin (but was given a MFG Aurobindo substitute Amox/Clav from Pharmacy) for a diagnosis of bacterial infection on the back of my neck.Out of 14 pills, I've taken the third one and that will be my last one ever!!.After my first pill I noticed the extreme headache but thought nothing about it being the side effects from the medicine. It lasted as long as it could last until I finally gave in after 3 hours and went looking for Advil for Migraines that I luckily bought that day. The Advil helped lessen and controlled the headache after 30 minutes. After what I've gone through the week before (depression, the ""infection"", headaches, and cold sores), this medicine was only making my life worse with the extreme throbbing headache (kind of like having someone bang on a sensitive area on the top left of my head). Noticed no other side effects yet, besides the unbearable headache since I'm stopping after my 3rd pill. Will put this name on ""medicines I can't take"".",d0r3m0n
12,Amoxicillin and Clavulanate,Skin and Structure Infection,,,"February 9, 2018",5,"I was prescribed this before getting a dental procedure done.  I took 2 doses (875 mg), 12 hours apart.  The first day, I experienced an unusual tingling, best way I could describe it would be like little bugs all over my body.  I also experienced stomach discomfort, mostly on the right side.  I woke up the next morning to bouts of watery diarrhea.  I stopped taking it and contacted my physician.  I've never had a reaction to regular amoxicillin but haven't taken antibiotics in decades.",DMarrria
13,Amoxicillin and Clavulanate,Skin and Structure Infection,,,"July 20, 2017",6,"Twice taking this antibiotic following oral surgery with bone grafting for dental implants, I subsequently contracted a fungal sinus infection.  The first time I had sinus symptoms and the second time no obvious sinus symptoms, which made it hard to diagnose. Both times I got a daily pattern over 6 hours of headache followed by anxiety/irritability followed by cognitive dysfunction as if I were drugged or severely sleep-deprived.  Because the second time was without nasal symptoms, it was hard to diagnose and daily pattern continued for 3 months. Once diagnosed, I took the anti-fungal drug, amphoterisin prepared as a nasal spray and I was cured of symptoms in one week.  Amox may clear natural sinus flora setting the stage for fungal infect.",fungalZombieAnt
14,Amoxicillin and Clavulanate,Skin and Structure Infection,1.0,,"May 10, 2017",6,"Started taking the medication 7 days prior to surgery and continued for a total of 14 days. Stomach issues began right away but not excessive. Got worse. Stomach cramps (not abdominal), dizziness, sweats, nausea, extreme fatigue. Did it work? No idea, this was a preventative measure and since I was having a procedure that I do NOT want to repeat, I stuck with it. Now it's 48 hours after the last dose and now I have the abdominal cramps and diarrhea. Hoping this doesn't last too long. I will not take this drug ever again. I've lost 15 days of my life so far.

It gave me a slightly upset stomach but quickly subsided with yogurt/probiotics etc. Took more augmentin after extraction, no upset stomach but noticed tiny bumps on lower half of face and neck. Started to feel hot and kind of itchy, very shaky. Shortly after I started burping and felt hungry like I hadn't eaten in days. An hour after 3rd dose I had never vomited so hard in my entire life, it was painful. Doc said to stop taking it - no duh. Stopped taking augmentin but nausea and vomiting still here. Face still hot and bumpy, skin itchy. Never allergic to reg. amoxicillin. I want this new med outta my system! NEVER AGAIN",worse off

This is rough stuff. During the 10 day cycle, although it cleared up the infection in my foot, I had begun to develop headaches, felt weak and tired, sleeplessness, and some stomach discomfort.

18,Amoxicillin and Clavulanate,Skin and Structure Infection,10.0,,"September 17, 2016",28,"During an emergency my cat bit my index finger.  After ~20 minutes I washed the wound w/ hot water & soap, then rinsed with alcohol and applied an antibiotic ointment. The skin around the puncture wound became warm, pink and started to swell 6 hours later. I began the 875/125 mg amoxicillin/clavulanic acid 24 hrs after that. By then the closest joint was aching and the symptoms had spread to the palm. About an hour after taking the tablet, I slowly opened and closed my hand into a tight fist about 15x to increase blood circulation. Within 12 hrs, most of the symptoms had dissipated. The joint was still a little stiff. Puncture wounds from cat bites are serious. See a doctor or start antibiotics at FIRST sign of infection!","Cat lover, AZ"

Hand swelled and was red. Took augmentin 8 hours after being bitten and within 3 days swelling went down and redness had faded. 6 years as an animal control officer and never injured once...help my friend pick out a cat at the local humane society and get bitten...oh the irony! This is an excellent medicine for cat bites. Had a friend tell me her dad got bitten by a cat and he ended up in the hospital and was gravely ill from an infection. Lucky me from my experience I knew to seek medical attention immediately. Anyone bitten by a cat should know they have about an 85% chance of infection and need to take it very seriously or you'll end up in hospital.,Anonymous
