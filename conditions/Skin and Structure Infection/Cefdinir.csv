0,Cefdinir,Skin and Structure Infection,1,Taken for less than 1 month,"September 23, 2021",1,"Every time I took one of these antibiotics I would get a distended stomach, itching, sleeplessness, migraine, and flu symptoms including a sore throat, cough, raspy dry voice, stuffed/runny nose, fever, chills, and horrific body pain. It took me 3 days of taking these pills to realize I always got significantly worse right after taking the pill but would get a little better before the next dose was due. I thought I had COVID and was dying that’s how severe the symptoms were. I could barely get out of bed to go to the bathroom. Never again.",deandra

4,Cefdinir,Skin and Structure Infection,6,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"July 31, 2017",2,"Had a prostate biopsy done (June 2017) which resulted in a severe infection. Chills, temp was 103.7, peeing blood. Had to be rushed to the ER and a central line put into my neck for antibiotics and fluids. I was in the ER for 2.5 days and released thank God. They saved my life. Doctor prescribed Cefdinir 300mg x 2 for the next 42 days to ensure the infection was destroyed. OK at first but started getting dizziness the last week. Starting tomorrow I'm off of Cefdinir and we will see how it goes. God bless you all and good health",Just Survive
5,Cefdinir,Skin and Structure Infection,1,Taken for less than 1 month,"July 15, 2017",4,"Use with caution. I was prescribed this in Thailand for what the doctor said was a bacterial infection. My first dose was given via IV and it instantly started to give me horrible abdominal cramps from my stomach down to my pelvic area. I continued to have abdominal pain and terrible watery diarrhea until I decided to discontinue use. Once I stopped taking it, the cramping ceased and the diarrhea went away within a day. Felt like it was poisoning my body. Use with caution!!",Horrible abdominal pain!
6,Cefdinir,Skin and Structure Infection,1,Taken for less than 1 month,"August 10, 2013",9,The doctor gave me this for an abscess. Around the third day I had bad diarrhea and horrible cramping.  After a day of that I was sent to the emergency room and was diagnosed with a c. diff infection. Its been 6 months now and I still have side effects. I have to watch what I eat and I still get cramps and constantly running to the bathroom frequently.  Now if I need to take an antibiotic I have to go to the gastroenterologist to make sure it is safe. ,Cmday2
