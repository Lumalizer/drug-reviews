0,Mupirocin topical,Skin and Structure Infection,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"January 24, 2022",0,"This stuff is phenomenal. I had a rather painful case of folliculitis that was first misdiagnosed and I was put on antiviral meds (I knew it was the wrong diagnosis...I had to explain to the Dr things she should have known from a simple Google search). After 3 days of no improvement and it actually got worse, I contacted an online Dr who took one look and said, it's not viral, it's bacterial, it's folliculitis. (What I had suspected all along). She suggested mupirocin, of which I had an old tube of (from what, I can't remember, perhaps acne?) so I figured, what the heck I'll try it at least until I can get the newer rx the next morning. Within ONE HOUR (I was shocked too), my swelling, pain and rash had almost completely disappeared along with my stress and worry. No side effects either! After 24 hours it's just about completely healed. Skin is back to its normal color, bumps are gone, no scarring, and no pain. This is a miracle drug (and I avoid pharmaceuticals at all costs).",SeaSeason247
1,Mupirocin topical,Skin and Structure Infection,1.0,,"April 25, 2021",5,"Prescribed for prophylactic use on surgical incision with skin graft (surgical removal of squamous cell carcinomas on lower legs) , to keep graft moist.  dressing to be changed once or twice a day for 5-6 weeks.  Second day began to feel burning at incisions.  After third day, woke with widespread hives on trunk, groin and upper arms and legs.  Diminished with OTC oral antihistamine.  Next morning woke with similar widespread hives.  Reported this to MD who, nurse reported, didn't think I could have absorbed enough to cause systemic hives.  Continued use caused swelling in ankles and feet, widespread weeping rash of an angry purple.  I stopped using the ointment without medical approval, which was forthcoming at the two week follow-up. I discovered subsequently that there is a direct statement that the ointment is not to be used to avoid bacterial infection on post surgical lesions.",MSD
2,Mupirocin topical,Skin and Structure Infection,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"March 25, 2020",25,I do not like this antibiotic cream mupirocin! It has been prescribed to me a few times (Iâ€™m prone to skin infections) and each time has only made my condition worse. The first time it caused terrible burning and increased redness and this past time it caused my skin to peel along with more redness and itchiness than I had before. I know many people have a positive experience with it but just know that you might experience negative side effects.,Youngone
3,Mupirocin topical,Skin and Structure Infection,10.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"February 23, 2020",8,"Actual cost of prescription Bactroban Mupirocin 2% cream was $291.69 for 15 grams.  My drug plan only required my payment of $3.60. But $288.07 is being ""paid"" for by all of you (us), in high insurance and health care costs.  This Rx has been on the market for a long time/  I should have asked about the actual cost before having the prescription filled, as I would not have had it filled, even at no cost to me.  And, because prescriptions are electronically filed, I never saw that 15 grams - far too much had been ordered.  I am filing complaints with every government entity, and the manufacturer.  I won't let this happen again. As to length of time using mupirocin calcium cream 2%, it has been only used very sporadically for the last 8 years, and in tiny amounts.  I have had no side effects. But I might have seen results with other, cheap, OTC antibacterial/antibiotic ointments.  I will rate the cream at 10, because it provided relief, and possibly healing.",Youmustbekidding

8,Mupirocin topical,Skin and Structure Infection,10.0,,"December 11, 2018",25,"I had these horrible bumps all over the sides of my nose (especially the cracks on the sides) and up across my bridge between eyebrows that would get bright red after a shower and peel some too! I looked stupid! Tired of this, I dug around in my med sac and found a lil tube of mupirocin ointment. So I smeared it generously all over my nose, eyebrows, and mouth. The next day, some of the bumps were gone, and the ones that weren't were shrinking! It's nearing the end of day 2, and the bumps are almost completely gone.  It does burn if you use too much but that just means it's working so it's ok.Summary: Smear mupirocin liberally on the affected area, if it burns and itches, dial it back one click, and just try to stay right in that slot. Give it a day or two and soon enough you'll be looking like a baby's butt.",Danglers
