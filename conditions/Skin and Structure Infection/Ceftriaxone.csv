0,Ceftriaxone,Skin and Structure Infection,10,Taken for less than 1 month,"July 1, 2020",1,"I hand an severe infection at a finger joint after a light dog bite. So about 30 hours later I received a shot of IV in left arm it was painful to the point they had to stop and change injection site. Reduced injection rate helped but still was harsh. Redness in finger diminished a lot during the night. Next morning doctor recommended another shot. In right arm this time I was apprehending pain again but this time just a small discomfort. My observation is the last IV was really correctly in the vein and rate of injection was adequate, even if the last 5ml was pushed by hand by the nurse. I was prescribed Amoxcillin orally for 5 days, 24 hours later after the second IV the swelling was gone and normal coloration.  Yes, this worked well for me so far and probably saved my finger from complications. Follow your infectious disease specialist advice they know what they are doing.",Nickname
