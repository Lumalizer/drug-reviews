4,Bactroban,Skin and Structure Infection,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"March 24, 2016",32,"I had a heat rash in my groin and it was red and very irritating. I used a small amount if the ointment twice a day after showering. Within 24 hours, the irritation was bearable, within 48 hours the irritation had stopped and within 72 hours the redness had faded. I still have dull red marks where the skin was damaged but the rash has totally gone. This, is a fantastic product for heat rash and also, if you have an insect bite, it stops the itching within 2 minutes. Can be bought over the counter in most Asian countries. Cost here in the Philippines is 299 pesos or around $7. Bargain!",JamesLevster

Prior to this I had a scab in my nose that hurt so I had been using Bactroban on it.  When I went for my surgery everyone was gowning up before they came into my room because apparently my nose swab results came back positive for MRSA, and the Bactroban was detected as well.  I was told Bactroban was the right medicine to use for the infection and actually by the time of my surgery my nose was already healed.",beverly1956
