0,Cipro,Skin and Structure Infection,10,Taken for less than 1 month,"December 29, 2020",4,"Overall it wasnâ€™t bad at all, never had any side effects I was good all the way through. Make sure you drink water daily when taking these pills. DON'T be scared by the bad reviews you see on the internet!! I was a little scared at first myself but it was perfectly fine for me and even got rid of my infection which was great! I would definitely recommend this but personally I would recommend trying a home remedy before going with any drug.",Jade
