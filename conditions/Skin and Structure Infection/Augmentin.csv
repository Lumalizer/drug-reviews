0,Augmentin,Skin and Structure Infection,3.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"October 6, 2020",4,"My cat bit my ankle in 5 places. Out of hours GP gave me Augmentin 500/125mg to take 3 times a day. 1st 7 days fine apart from urinating, diarrhoea had to force feed myself as no appetite.7 days nurse came for 2nd time one of the bites fine the others raring to go. It gave me cellulitis. Leg was red, black swollen plus my neck. So GP gave me another 7 days worth. (Had 2 days break). bad diarrhoea/accidents Lying in bed being sick high fever, migraines, feeling so ill. Perspiring, tight chest, palpitations,itchy vagina, became very depressed. I was in a foul mood, memory loss and acid reflux. I thought I had septicaemia. Therefore I only took 3 days of the new pack. By Monday I felt great apart from another bite came up. Nurse dressed and GP put me on Flucloxacillin 500mg and so far so good. Please note these pills are awful. Trying to force food down when you feel so very ill is terrible. Glad it worked for the first week (with slight of the above side effects.) Iâ€™d rather give birth!!",Soulsurvivor66

2,Augmentin,Skin and Structure Infection,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"March 31, 2019",8,"I took this for an ear infection, it worked well. One of the side effects was it cured me of  my cystic acne. I was about to give up after my dermatologist tried 4 different antibiotics. Two months out and my acne is gone. I went from having penny and quarter spots on my head to nothing. My testosterone injections brings my flare ups out, now I can take a normal dose without not even a hint of acne. Amazing!!!!!!",Mike8976
3,Augmentin,Skin and Structure Infection,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"February 2, 2017",9,"Started on augmentin the day prior to a simple tooth extraction. It gave me a slightly upset stomach but quickly subsided with yogurt/probiotics etc. Took more augmentin after extraction, no upset stomach but noticed tiny bumps on lower half of face and neck. Started to feel hot and kind of itchy, very shaky. Shortly after I started burping and felt hungry like I hadn't eaten in days. An hour after 3rd dose I had never vomited so hard in my entire life, it was painful. Doc said to stop taking it - no duh. Stopped taking augmentin but nausea and vomiting still here. Face still hot and bumpy, skin itchy. Never allergic to reg. amoxicillin. I want this new med outta my system! NEVER AGAIN",worse off
4,Augmentin,Skin and Structure Infection,,Taken for less than 1 month,"October 29, 2016",16,"Took Augmentin for a bacterial infection in my foot. This is rough stuff. During the 10 day cycle, although it cleared up the infection in my foot, I had begun to develop headaches, felt weak and tired, sleeplessness, and some stomach discomfort. It works well if you can endure all the side effects. Would not recommend if other options are available.",whit.
5,Augmentin,Skin and Structure Infection,8.0,,"May 21, 2014",30,"My neighbors cat scratched and bit me. At first I thought I sprained my wrist doing something but when my wrist was red like a lobster swelling in pain and pus draining from bite I knew it was due to the cat bite. Went to ER they said I had cellulitis. They gave me an i.v. of this then prescribed it. For ten days. Started to work immediately. I had mild diarrhea for the first three days felt nauseous and very groggy, trouble thinking clearly. I still have dark urine but wrist is just about completely healed. I'm on day 6, 4 more days to go.  Then I'm done regular amoxicillin made me feel weird but didn't give me much side effects however I was prescribed amoxicillin for abscessed teeth.",Enthroned
6,Augmentin,Skin and Structure Infection,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"April 19, 2013",39,"I have an active pilonidal cyst. For those not familiar with this condition, it is extremely painful. It involves a massive infection. I have been treated with Augmentin XR for 11 days so far. After about 8 days, I could feel a noticeable improvement. It works great, however, it is rather rough on your digestive system.",phantom jet pilot
