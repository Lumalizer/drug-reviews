0,Sprycel,Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia,10,,"October 3, 2016",5,"I have ALL Phil+, my Dr put me on Sprycel after my bone marrow (stem cell) transplant as a precautionary measure. Initially I suffered the side effects, mainly pleural edema but different from others, I had a drainage done (through my back) which seemed to cure it immediately. I stayed off the Sprycel for 1 week then went back on it at a lower dosage (40mg once a day). I have grittiness of the eyes (eyes are not dry, they tear alot infact), a little edema in the legs and feet. I don't really have anything bad to say about Sprycel, I have nothing to compare it to. I'm alive though. Should be cured in another year. I also am on the study where this drug is provided no cost.",Rickkronos
