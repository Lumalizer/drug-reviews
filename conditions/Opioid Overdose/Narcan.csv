0,Narcan,Opioid Overdose,10,Taken for less than 1 month,"November 6, 2021",0,"I’ve carried Narcan nasal spray for the last three years, after a friend I’d never suspected to have a drug problem had nearly died of an opiate overdose when he’d relapsed. And feeling anxiously helpless about not wanting him to die I dove into online research and decided that carrying Naloxone nasal spray was something I could do in order to help anyone near me dying as a result of a relapse. He’s never once needed it, but six separate times I’ve administered it to unhoused strangers utterly foreign to my life until I stumbled upon them while I was biking or walking in Portland. Naloxone was miraculous and gave them a bridge that successfully saved their lives by keeping them breathing until an ambulance ambulance arrived with paramedics. EVERYONE should carry it. Period!",ProPortland
