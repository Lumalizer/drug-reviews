0,Rituximab,Bullous Pemphigoid,5,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"July 23, 2017",0,I had 4 rituxan infusions last year. Discontinued all meds in Dec. 2016. Symptoms returned within 2 weeks. Blood work in Jan. 2017 showed my numbers were still as high as when I was first tested a year earlier. Started again with the azathioprine and have had 4  rituxan infusions this year. Will not know if infusions worked until I have more blood work. My infusions take approximately 5 hours to avoid most side effects.,Photodancer
1,Rituximab,Bullous Pemphigoid,5,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"July 27, 2016",0,"I had 2 infusions in June, 2 weeks apart. Had a severe reaction with the first infusion and a mild reaction with the second infusion. Have not noticed any changes in my condition. I've read it might take up to 3 months to see the effects of rituximab. Am still taking azathioprine, prednisone and doxycycline to manage symptoms.",Photodancer
