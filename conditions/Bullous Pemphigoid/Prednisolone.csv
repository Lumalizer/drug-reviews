0,Prednisolone,Bullous Pemphigoid,9,Taken for less than 1 month,"September 28, 2015",4,"I was sliding downhill very fast with Pemphigoid/ Pemphigus (I have symptoms of both) before I started taking the Pred- I had them sitting in my cupboard because I was too scared to take them after hearing bad things about the side effects. I know they don't suit everyone but they have been excellent so far for me. There are side effects yes, night sweats, leg twinges, mood swings, curing migraines and curing a persistent arm pain I had for 6 months! The sores on my body are almost healed in 3 weeks after 5 months of agony and I can actually eat again. Long term they're maybe less good for you but they do work well.",JoPemphigusV
