0,Lorazepam,Sedation,,Taken for less than 1 month,"February 12, 2022",0,"Ativan (lorazepam):My husband went to hospital for afib they gave him 4 doses of ativan a day to claim him down.  Well, a few days later his heart stopped.  He has COPD giving him ativan slowed his breathing and his heart stopped.   He went in the hospital walking, talking, eating, no oxygen needed came out not being able to eat or do anything on oxygen 24/7 now.   This drug is dangerous, and the fact that hospital overdosed him sending him into cardiac arrest.",Bad experience
1,Lorazepam,Sedation,,Taken for less than 1 month,"July 17, 2021",1,"M y doctor just recently prescribed Ativan to help me sleep. I was going 3 - 4 nights in a row without sleep and totally unable to function during the day. I was so very tired but could not sleep. I have some health issues that aggravate all of it also. The last few nights I have not needed to take it but tonight I decided to try It for the first time. I took it , 1 mg, at around 8 this evening so I could go to sleep early. It is now almost 2 am and I am wide awake. Any suggestions?",Ck
2,Lorazepam,Sedation,10.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"July 4, 2021",0,"I cannot sleep, almost never. If I do sleep it will be for 2-3 hours due to extreme exhaustion. I started taking Lorazepam (Ativan) 1mg first night, I slept for 5 hours. That is a win for me. So I waited a few days and tried 1.5mg, I slept for 8 hours, yes, I was a bit disoriented and things were a bit off for me, that lasted about 2 hours. BUT, now, I take them in the weekends only and seem to get 5-6 hours of sleep during the week and 8-9 hours on the weekends for 2 nights.After 40 years, since I was 17 years old, this is a life saver. I experience no anxiety as a side note. Sleep deprivation hallucinations were common, glad to say they are ZERO in my life life now.",Canuckwolf
3,Lorazepam,Sedation,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"March 13, 2021",3,"Was given 2mg lorazepam prior to tooth extraction and bone graft. They said I'd be really out if it for hours and need a ride home, etc. Didn't feel a thing. Really annoying. I told the perio's assistant afterwards that I hadn't felt any sedation and she said ""well you came through fine anyways"". So rude. I was tense and digging my nails into my palm. It made me wonder if someone at the pharmacy had switched pills or something. They aren't using nitrous oxide because of covid. That is what works, not lorazepam",Connie
4,Lorazepam,Sedation,9.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"November 28, 2020",5,This medicine lorazepam has helped me so much I have been put on dozens of antipsychotics which give me akathesia was started on lorazepam pretty late and the first time I took it I thought it was a miracle I was able to stop thinking for a few minutes. I have constant obsessive and intrusive thoughts constantly and this medicine I think has saved my life only problem is taking it too much and the effects start to get weaker and weaker.,Anonymous
5,Lorazepam,Sedation,1.0,,"October 30, 2020",2,Night one took  half a lorazepam and a few hours later I woke and took another half.  Woke up decent in the morning. Tonight I said I’ll take the whole thing at once. I totally feel crazy. And I’m awake but exhausted hours until it kicked in,Bettylou22
6,Lorazepam,Sedation,4.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"April 12, 2020",8,Ativan (lorazepam):agree with post above - xanax or klonopin are similar and stronger; will get the job done better.  and Klonopin isprobably the better  than xanax; many reports showx is more addictive but k is more effective. ,fusebird
7,Lorazepam,Sedation,5.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"June 13, 2019",6,"Was a little bit euphoric at the beginning, but this went away fast. Now, only sedation, just pure sedation - you want to do nothing, you can't concentrate or in particular, you don't have the will to do something. It will waste your time, so, stop it.",mr robot
8,Lorazepam,Sedation,2.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"February 7, 2018",3," Works okay for sleep but did nothing for  psychotic agitation for me. I refused it but unfortunately, I was under a section so they injected me, 3 hours later I'm still wide awake.",moadej
9,Lorazepam,Sedation,10.0,,"January 11, 2017",27,"Ativan (lorazepam):52 year old diagnosed with ovarian cancer in July 2016. Received chest mediport in August and went through 12 weeks of chemo. Only side effects were constipation from chemo and sleepless nights from Dedcadron. While these steroids made me feel strong and allow me to work while taking chemo they also keep me wired at night. Only on those days of chemo I would take 1  mg of Ativan at night. So blessed to get some much needed rest and was at work by 6:00 ready for my work day. Feeling rested and getting that quality sleep is very vital when fighting this disease and taking chemo. I just had IP port surgically implanted into abdomen today. Staring next 3 cycles of IP chemo after having surgery December 8th.Ativan has helped me, no side effects.",FightingANDWILLWin
10,Lorazepam,Sedation,9.0,Taken for 5 to 10 years,"October 20, 2016",17,"I have been prescribed lorazepam since I was first diagnosed with Bipolar Disorder Type II with Anxiety 6 years ago. I have been taking it on and off for 6 years. I take on average a 0.5 mg pill a day (usually before bed) and have not had any problems with addiction, side effects, etc. It really helps me fall asleep and feel relaxed when I am stressed out. Also works well for extreme irritability. I would definitely recommend this medication.",BipolarGirl31

12,Lorazepam,Sedation,10.0,,"November 1, 2014",39,Lorazepam Intensol (lorazepam):Very helpful for short term treatment of anxiety and insomnia. I found I only needed to take half dose to have a good nights sleep and to feel calm the next day. Such a relief after 2 years cancer treatment left me very tired and anxious. Only problem is the doctors don't like it to be used other than for short term.,charlie 2

17,Lorazepam,Sedation,8.0,,"May 7, 2010",20,"I have (had) a severe needle phobia.  I got really sick and was often given high doses of Ativan while in the hospital, that exposure to needles did help a little bit.  Now I need to get my blood tested often.  I used to take three or four 0.5mg pills before getting my blood taken and with family member support was able to have blood taken with little drama. I would usually fall asleep for several hours after.  I have been able to work my way down to one 0.5mg pill when I get blood taken and after a half hour nap I am fine.  I would not take this day to day for anxiety because of the drowsiness, I also don't feel it is necessary for me.Ativan has been wonderful helping me get over my phobia.",Anonymous

19,Lorazepam,Sedation,5.0,,"December 5, 2009",55,"Ativan (lorazepam):Ativan was prescribed to me for severe anxiety. I took 2mg one to two times daily. I took the medication for two months. I however, DID NOT follow the advise of my doctor and quit cold turkey. It was five days of hell for me. I did not sleep AT ALL,  I had panic attacks, trouble breathing, and severe sweating for two more weeks when I did start sleeping again. The medication was very helpful but when I quit the side effects were just about unbearable. My advice is use this medication with caution and follow doctor instructions to the latter.",Anonymous

21,Lorazepam,Sedation,10.0,,"November 5, 2009",37,Ativan (lorazepam):Ativan has been a God send for me during these stressful times. It has helped me sleep better and has helped with my anxiety because of the stress I'm under. My doctor has prescribed 1mg x 2 a day as needed and that seems like the perfect dose for me. I also use pain medicines for prior spine surgery and have had no problem with this medication.,trieded
