1,Promethazine,Sedation,,Taken for less than 1 month,"March 27, 2022",0,"This drug has ruined my life. I have been researching it since..I’ve been on a Phyche ward as a direct result.  I  woke up extremely trippy & started trying to kill myself, my son had to go with my parents, he is heartbroken. I was fitting in the hospital as well.I  am now paranoid. I never sleep & my life as I know it is over. My whole personality has gone. I’m paranoid & after almost 2 months can still feel it in my face brain & body. My tongue swelled up & was hanging out I couldn't breath. I hallucinated & lost my cognitive abilities & my personality.  I know my son can’t come home as this has not got better. I cannot organise myself. I have autism & adhd-generalised anxiety. I felt dizzy everything wobbled & I now don’t know what to do with myself. All I could say when I woke up was  ""it just won’t go - and it still hasn’t",Nicky

My Dr wouldn't give me sleeping tablets so recommended phenergan. I take two 25mg before bed and it takes about 1 hour until I'm super chilled and sedated.

4,Promethazine,Sedation,3.0,,"February 16, 2022",3,I have used promethazine on and off for years to continue sleeping when I get broken sleep.

My psychiatrist has given it to me a few times when my insomnia is really bad, and sedation is just absolutely necessary. It is not used for insomnia in the United States, but it is used for insomnia in Europe. I can't drive a car the next day if I take this at night, it makes me extremely sleepy, and I really don't think it is a safe drug for me to take at home. If I was in the hospital, I would not care if it was given to me because who wants to be in the hospital, right? mostly used for nausea/vomiting and cough syrup combo",3purposes
9,Promethazine,Sedation,9.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"December 28, 2021",11,"Phenergan (promethazine):I found half a 25mg tablet good for sleep. Can take hours before it starts working . The first time you take it, it works wonderfully. Be mindful it is an old anti psychotic and has a long half life, so what that means is it builds up in your body. Always start on a low dose of 10mg and increase when needed. High doses can give you restless leg syndrome as it drops your dopamine level. It can also suppress breathing - not ideal!. Best taken an hour before bed as its plasma peak is approx. 2 to 3 hours (the most affect) although that time level is dependent on your rate  of metabolism. I am horrified reading how many people double the max. recommended dose when they take the first time, not knowing how it affects you.",Yol

I started getting restless legs to the point where I had to wander around in my flat for hours like a zombie, and I sometimes only got a few hours of sleep. Also I began to get a bloody nose. Every morning I had to clean my nose with tissues, and the paper was always bloody. And the weight gain. Gained 15 kilos in that time. Right before I quit taking them I was miserable. Almost every night I had restless legs and I didn’t get much sleep. I have been off Phenergan since the beginning of August - I lost 7.6 kilos, my nose is just fine and I haven’t had one second with restless legs since.

It works great if I take it about 3 hours before I want to sleep  (either 25mg - sometimes works) or 50mg (always works unless I'm extremely stressed).   However I do notice I'm 50% slower and dumber at all work tasks the following day if I take 50mg. Sometimes it's worth it though just for a good night's sleep.Normally I just take it occassionally, but  one week I was having a lot of trouble sleeping and so  I took at bigger dose. When I woke up the next morning my phone was in the bathroom sink and I have no memory of how it got there.  So overall it worked well but I'm sticking to 50mg max from now on.

This medication should really be taken just before you go to bed, I wouldn't recommend taking it while you're watching TV or anything because in my experience, you have to be trying to fall asleep for this to work. Even then, it's a horrible drug. 25mg is too little and I still wake up in the night a lot, 50mg is way too much and I'm pretty sure my throat closed up for a second in the middle of the night because I woke up gagging and I don't suffer from sleep apnoea so that was weird. Either way, any dosage of this stuff causes terrible daytime drowsiness the next day, I'm not sure if that's down to the half life of the medication or whether it is purely because it gives you really poor quality sleep.",scg123

Felt tired during the day also, but not as bad.I find that my optimal dose is about 1/3 of the tablet - it helps me sleep and the side effects of tiredness aren’t as bad in the morning. I do still experience agitation when woken up by someone else and would rather carry on sleeping but it isn’t as severe and usually after 20 mins or so I’m fully awake.

Initially it was my psychiatrist who prescribed it due to the reluctancy to prescribe diazepam incase of dependency and addiction. I was put on the maximum dose of 100mg daily for agitation and to help me sleep (I don't usually have sleep problems but when I do they are awful since it's trauma related night terrors).I took them nearly every day and still couldn't tell you for sure if they helped. I think they may help reduce my agitation slightly but for sleep I'm uncertain. That tells me they aren't that effective if I can't even figure out if they made a difference.

Before going on dymista for my hayfever I would take 10-25 mg of phenergan each night (or day depending if I’m working) with a 2mg SR melatonin and tbh, after a week of continuous use the phenergan no longer sedates me (down-regulated receptors I think?). However if I take a break from it, one 10mg will knock me out in an hour. I sleep deeply and feel groggy the next day. It also helps my anxiety and the nausea I sometimes get with melatonin. However there are side effects; headaches, fatigue, and because it relaxes the muscles in sleep, mild sleep apnoea. I sometimes wake from dreams, gagging/dry retching or gasping for air. I also suffer from VCD and find I’m more susceptible to attacks when regularly taking phenergan. I read somewhere than neuroleptic drugs can do this. So now I take it if needed.",MMK

52,Promethazine,Sedation,10.0,,"October 2, 2019",47,"I‘m getting prescribed promethazine for insomnia which is caused by a bad Social anxiety (I get the feeling someone is watching me I‘m sleeping, and generally when I leave my house I get really anxious.

It really does help me with my sleep as well which kinda lowers the anxiety that also was caused by my lack of sleep, but it doesn‘t completely kill the anxiety. Just a tip from me if you want to get rid of your anxiety stop taking stuff like benzos or so and quit doing drugs if you currently do any. Start meditating it really can calm you down and makes you get along with yourself! I didn‘t believe it, till I tried it!Promethazine is good for sleeping and that it.

Whilst in my late forties I had a blocked nose I spent a fortune on remedies and although this sounds insignificant it became a constant annoyance as symptoms were so awful it caused nose bleeds, cold sores in my nose, sleepless nights etc. Eventually I went to the doctor who informed me it was a allergy. Beconase nasal spray and a antihistamine tablet. This I used daily as my allergy didn't subside with the changing seasons, it held it back on a good month although I never had a restful sleep. Then I found Phenergen and since I started taking it just before bedtime all of my symptoms have gone! The down side is I find it challenging  to buy!",Artycooper
105,Promethazine,Sedation,10.0,,"July 23, 2013",101,"I'm 73 years old now and started taking Phenergan a long, long time ago.  For the last 35 years I've taken a little more than 1/2 of a 25 mg tablet just about every night, about 3-4 hours before I want to go to sleep.  Although I wake up about 3 times/night, I fall back to sleep easily and sleep for 8 to 9 hours. It is very ""drying"" but I consider this worth the good sleep. Often I combine it with 0.5 mg melatonin.",another long-time user
106,Promethazine,Sedation,10.0,,"September 19, 2010",178,"Phenergan (promethazine):Although I have fairly high blood pressure - for which I take medication, and use asthma inhalers to prevent asthma, I have found Phenergan to be absolutely marvelous for insomnia - I have an overactive mind! I find it's best to take it about four hours before I go to bed - then it knocks me out for the night. Sometimes I still feel a bit drowsy in the mornings and have discovered I only need the lowest dose to get a good night's sleep. I only take it the night following a sleepless night. Hope this is helpful.",Anonymous

108,Promethazine,Sedation,,,"September 16, 2009",107,"Phenergan (promethazine):I have found this wonderful for helping me sleep after years of taking other sleeping pills. This has worked, thanks.",shooz
109,Promethazine,Sedation,9.0,,"May 16, 2009",222,"Phenergan (promethazine):I've used Phenergan, which is sold over the counter, as a sleeping aid for about one year now. Taken one hour before bedtime, it rarely fails to put me to sleep. The wondrous thing is that I have kept the same dose, and there are no withdrawal symptoms, if you stop using the drug for a week or two. Definitely the best substitute for any prescription sleep aid, that I've ever tried. Highly recommended as a sleep aid.",Anonymous
110,Promethazine,Sedation,9.0,,"December 16, 2008",111,Phenergan (promethazine):This medicine helped sedate me when I was having back pain.  I had two herniated discs and it calmed me down before and after the surgeries. It is not habit forming and was a plus with all the other medicines I was on.,trainman
