1,Trazodone,Sedation,,Taken for 5 to 10 years,"March 7, 2022",1,"I was taking trazadone for 8 years for insomnia. After a few years it became ineffective. I kept taking it because I can't take any other sleeping pills .I didn't know trazadone is also an anti depressant. I can't take what I call regular anti depressants. I stopped trazadone 9 moths ago.  I have been having headaches, brain fog and anxiety for 9 months now .IRS called discontinuation syndrome. I call it a living nightmare ,I am worried it will never go away",Jim

Took a break for a while. Last night tried to take 100 mg of trazadone again since switching to bupropion which causes major issues with insomnia (sleeping 1-2 hours at most or not at all). Bupropion gave me no headaches, but when I added on trazadone 100 last night, wow this is one of the worst headaches I have ever experienced. Similar to when I had viral meningitis. Whole head is throbbing and I can’t move my head without making it worse. And I have suffered from chronic migraine for 10+ years so I know what a bad headache feels like.

I was prescribed trazodone 10+ years ago and chalked up my bad experience to my doctor prescribing too much. I agreed to try it again under a new doctor because a lot can change in 10 years, apparently I was wrong. I was given 50mg. I took one pill, felt the slight drowsiness after about 30mins but not enough to put me to sleep, it took about an hour or two for me to fall asleep. When I woke up in the morning I had a terrible migraine with sensitivity to light and nausea that lasted the entire day and night. I feel weak and am barely able to do much moving. I am able to eat but the nausea won’t go away. Excedrin was able to get rid of the headache. I took Benadryl in hopes that it would ease the nausea but it has not. My only hope is that it will go away by morning if I ever fall asleep. I will NOT be taking this med again.

No one looked at trazodone.  I have been weaning myself off Trazodone and the arc of healing is positive but day to day can be debilitating.

The doctor who prescribed it for me was an ""old-time"" doc who wasn't into unnecessary medication (or any, most of the time) but saw there was a need that day with me. The fact that it was also an antidepressant was also a plus (but ultimately it wasn't effective enough on its own for that purpose). Taking trazodone at night (50mg) plus 1/2 a typical Ambien pill helps me sleep a good five or six hours straight--beats the way I used to sleep and thought was normal for most of my life; waking up every two or three hours.",dragonflycat

I did experience slight dry mouth which was to be expected.  I'm hoping it continues to work good and hopefully tonight I wont wake up so often.
