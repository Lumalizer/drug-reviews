0,Phenergan,Sedation,9.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"March 27, 2022",0,Take 50mg at night to help me sleep as it takes away the anxiety. It works a treat. I'm very sedated and calm after 1 hour and can sleep 8 hours. Only down side I seem to crave sugar foods like chocolate so I tend to binge (can eat whole entire packet of biscuits in 10 mins),Mike87
1,Phenergan,Sedation,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"March 12, 2022",0,"As others have commented, this is completely useless for people with insomnia. Don't waste your time with it",Redbull1412
2,Phenergan,Sedation,9.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"December 28, 2021",11,"I found half a 25mg tablet good for sleep. Can take hours before it starts working . The first time you take it, it works wonderfully. Be mindful it is an old anti psychotic and has a long half life, so what that means is it builds up in your body. Always start on a low dose of 10mg and increase when needed. High doses can give you restless leg syndrome as it drops your dopamine level. It can also suppress breathing - not ideal!. Best taken an hour before bed as its plasma peak is approx. 2 to 3 hours (the most affect) although that time level is dependent on your rate  of metabolism. I am horrified reading how many people double the max. recommended dose when they take the first time, not knowing how it affects you.",Yol
3,Phenergan,Sedation,10.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"October 17, 2021",2,"I have really bad insomnia. I can not get to sleep at all. I take 50 mg of phenergan. And it takes a while to work like 4 hours then I fall asleep. I have tried other meds and they work for a short time but it is slow to work so  that I lay in bed for at least 4 hours till I fall asleep, but hey least it works.",xxxnsh
4,Phenergan,Sedation,1.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"October 15, 2021",9,"I got these over 4-5 months. I started with 25 mg and ended up taking 2 every evening before bed. I started getting restless legs to the point where I had to wander around in my flat for hours like a zombie, and I sometimes only got a few hours of sleep. Also I began to get a bloody nose. Every morning I had to clean my nose with tissues, and the paper was always bloody. And the weight gain. Gained 15 kilos in that time. Right before I quit taking them I was miserable. Almost every night I had restless legs and I didn’t get much sleep. I have been off Phenergan since the beginning of August - I lost 7.6 kilos, my nose is just fine and I haven’t had one second with restless legs since. I’m back to having trouble falling a sleep but I definitely prefer that from all the horrible side effects.",Marie
5,Phenergan,Sedation,5.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"October 11, 2021",1,"I have recently started taking phenergan, I take two 50mg tablets about 20 minutes before sleep. 9 times out of 10 I'm having the most intense nightmares! I've literally just woke up from another. These tablets do work however you need to be mindful nightmares can occur.",Nightmares!
6,Phenergan,Sedation,2.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"September 10, 2021",2,"Although this medication isn’t strong enough to sedate you, it gave me the most craziest/strangest dreams ever. The type of dreams you can remember every detail ....",Weirdest dreams
7,Phenergan,Sedation,1.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"June 12, 2021",16,"I don't know if I class myself as an insomniac but I usually wake up a load of times in the night which disturbs my sleep and makes me tired in the day so I decided to try Phenergan. This medication should really be taken just before you go to bed, I wouldn't recommend taking it while you're watching TV or anything because in my experience, you have to be trying to fall asleep for this to work. Even then, it's a horrible drug. 25mg is too little and I still wake up in the night a lot, 50mg is way too much and I'm pretty sure my throat closed up for a second in the middle of the night because I woke up gagging and I don't suffer from sleep apnoea so that was weird. Either way, any dosage of this stuff causes terrible daytime drowsiness the next day, I'm not sure if that's down to the half life of the medication or whether it is purely because it gives you really poor quality sleep.",scg123
8,Phenergan,Sedation,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"April 2, 2021",2,I tried to use 50mg to go to sleep and the medication had absolutely no affect on me other than heaviness in my legs. I guess it depends on who you are.,J
9,Phenergan,Sedation,6.0,Taken for 5 to 10 years,"March 24, 2021",11,"I have been taking these for almost 5 years what started as 1 x 10mg then turned into a huge dose. I have now dropped down to 3 x 10mg a night and have decided it’s time to go completely cold off them. I started taking these to sleep easier, as due to anxiety it was hard to fall asleep. I have made the decision to come off them as I was getting intense nightmares which made me afraid to fall asleep, my body was bruising extremely easily and my platelets were beginning to drop. Just be careful if you have an addictive personality",Anonymous

11,Phenergan,Sedation,1.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"February 4, 2021",34,"I took two to get some sleep as I suffer from insomnia and we had a family gathering the following day. Still hadn't fallen asleep by 5am so took another one.   Family turned up, I don't remember. I thought there were worms crawling in my carpet,  I was talking to a mop which I thought was a person, thought I saw millions of baby spiders on the walls. I lost track of about 36 hours and was hallucinating the entire time!  After doing an internet search, I found out they can cause hallucinations! They should have it on the box. I wrote to the company but never heard back. I was so embarrassed and felt humiliated in front of my family. At one stage they phoned for an ambulance. PLEASE be careful with them.",Shelly
12,Phenergan,Sedation,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"December 20, 2020",249,"My partner was prescribed 25mg to take each night as he wasn't sleeping. The first night he took one it wiped him out and he was soaking with sweat.  I had to help him get undressed and into bed he was that drowsy.  The next day he looked drugged up.  Then the second night he took another and never woke up, he passed away in his sleep.  I thought he was just sleeping until I found him. The post mortem came back un-ascertained and I have been told it will take anywhere between 6-8mnths to get an answer however this is the only new medication he had taken.  His other meds he took regularly so I blame this.  Please be careful with this drug.",Kaz
13,Phenergan,Sedation,5.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"October 29, 2020",70,"I took 25mg Phenergan to help me sleep. It worked! I've been taking it for almost 2 years but only recently realized, when I stopped taking it, that it was causing me to have a low mood and a REALLY dry mouth to the point where I needed a drink with me at every meeting because it would affect my speech. When I stopped taking it, I woke up 4-5 times in the night, which is normal given I've got small children, but woke in the morning feeling a lot more clear-headed, less headaches and didn't have the need to guzzle glasses of water! Pharmacists only ever warned of drowsiness but not these side effects so wanted to share them with everyone! This medicine will get you to sleep, but it comes with a significant cost!",JohnSmith

15,Phenergan,Sedation,10.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"September 13, 2020",104,I suffer PMS and insomnia. I tried all types of herbs and supplement sleep aids even Melatonin with worked for me for a couple of nights but d be back to the same thing waking up at 3am or not sleeping more than 3 hours a night.

16,Phenergan,Sedation,1.0,,"August 13, 2020",94,"Please be careful with these. About 3 years ago I took some to get a few hours sleep. I had to ask the Pharmacist for them as they were kept behind the counter. I got the 25mg’s and had no idea how strong they were.I’m embarrassed and still feel humiliated with what happened.  I  took 2 at first,  I honestly thought they would just give me a few hours sleep and nothing else.I was hallucinating!!  I won’t go into great details but I thought my family were in the house with me, they weren’t.My family and neighbour told me some of the things I did. They ended up calling an ambulance. I wrote to the company and also did a long internet search which I discovered that one rare side effect was in fact hallucinating. Please be careful with them. A big lesson learnt, always take as prescribed.",Mary

18,Phenergan,Sedation,9.0,,"March 9, 2020",25,"Phenergan is the best sedation I have seen...    I find over 12.5 mg knocks me for "" six "".            Most of these medications are best when used sparingly , when needed.  Taking sedation every night tells me a powerful  anti psychotic may be a more suitable option.",macca
19,Phenergan,Sedation,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"August 2, 2019",121,This stuff is garbage for sleep. My doctor put me on this & took me off Zolpidem which worked great. Why screw with what works? Promethazine may work for people with mild sleeping issues but for those of us with severe insomnia it's like taking a skittle candy. Doesn't do a thing!,Jo

23,Phenergan,Sedation,8.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"November 28, 2018",65,"Has anyone had weight gain with Phenergen 25mg? I've put on 5 kilos quickly since using this & another drug, Valdoxen. Valdoxen helps which your melatonin receptors, is also an antidepressant, & says you do not put weight on. Not sure which one it is! Phenergen does say it can cause weight gain, esp in females, but they are not sure why. Though they state it's thought it can make you hungry thus you eat more. This isn't the case for me. I've been eating & exercising normally so something is going on. It's fabulous for sleep though, I finally get a great sleep. Confused!!",Kelly
24,Phenergan,Sedation,6.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"April 8, 2018",30,"I have restarted taking 3 months ago, after coming off amitriptyline cold turkey. These are more suited as you can take most cold and flu medication without issues, which was always a issue.The tablets take effect quickly (1.5 hours) first started on 50mg per night now down to 30mg due to tablets now making me more sleepy during the day time than before. I would recommend these to any anxiety or insomnia suffer as they do not have neuro side effects like other sleepers.",K

29,Phenergan,Sedation,10.0,,"September 19, 2010",178,"Although I have fairly high blood pressure - for which I take medication, and use asthma inhalers to prevent asthma, I have found Phenergan to be absolutely marvelous for insomnia - I have an overactive mind! I find it's best to take it about four hours before I go to bed - then it knocks me out for the night. Sometimes I still feel a bit drowsy in the mornings and have discovered I only need the lowest dose to get a good night's sleep. I only take it the night following a sleepless night. Hope this is helpful.",Anonymous

31,Phenergan,Sedation,9.0,,"May 16, 2009",222,"I've used Phenergan, which is sold over the counter, as a sleeping aid for about one year now. Taken one hour before bedtime, it rarely fails to put me to sleep. The wondrous thing is that I have kept the same dose, and there are no withdrawal symptoms, if you stop using the drug for a week or two. Definitely the best substitute for any prescription sleep aid, that I've ever tried. Highly recommended as a sleep aid.",Anonymous
