0,Hydroxyzine Pamoate,Sedation,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"March 30, 2022",0,"Odd! I’m reading everyone’s comments and I had absolutely no sedated feeling. Not tired at all! I prescribed 50mg then, 100 mg a month later and I gained weight as well. My Dr. promised I wouldn’t gain weight hence why I got off my trazadone because of that exact reason… then again every time I spoke to her ( 6 months in) she asked if I was a new patient. Just, do your own research and read reviews… idiot Drs!!!",Nikko
1,Hydroxyzine Pamoate,Sedation,8.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"March 21, 2022",2,Was prescribed this medication a few years ago to help me sleep at 10mg. I don't need to take it every night. It stays in your system for up to 14 hours so it's difficult to wake up the next day. I usually take it a few hours before sleep to mitigate some of the fatigue.  I'm pretty sure there's better medications for this as this was primarily an old allergy medication.  Be careful as it can cause some serious drug interactions with other meds/antibiotics.,Anonymous
2,Hydroxyzine Pamoate,Sedation,1.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"March 7, 2022",1,"I was prescribed this medication (ranging between 25 and 50mg) for panic attacks and insomnia. I began taking this medication on a daily basis for sedation in September of 2021. It did (and still does) help me sleep through the night, but the weight gain is huge! I subtly put on 10 pounds in the fall, but assumed it was from lifting more often. Nope. My weight was taken at a doctor's appointment in late February 2022 and I had put on ANOTHER 10-15 pounds. I did not change my diet or exercise. Never have I ever gained this much weight from a medication, even after taking nearly all of the atypical antipsychotics, SSRIs/SNRIs, beta blockers, etc. I am now categorized as overweight, which is mind-blowing. I went from 135 pounds (5'5) to 155lbs. The weight gain has destroyed my mental health and thrown off any confidence (which was little to begin with) I did have. I would switch back to Ambien before taking this medication ever again.",BiPoLaR

5,Hydroxyzine Pamoate,Sedation,6.0,,"February 20, 2022",0,"I’ve been taking hydroxyzine since I was pregnant for sleep. I’ve been on it for 4 years now. I’d say it works better than nothing, but I’m not certain I’m actually sleeping when I take it. I often think I’m dreaming and realize I’m awake and just daydreaming. Despite taking it, I am always tired. If I don’t take it, I get extremely nauseas. Recently, I started noticing I was having memory problems. I would be driving and momentarily not know where I was. I also forget words a lot. I’m 35 years old, so I found this to be concerning. I looked this drug up, and it can cause these kinds of problems long term. After not taking it for a week, I’m the still exhausted. My sleep is pretty poor. However, I’m definitely more motivated and don’t feel the brain fog. I think I’ll just start taking hydroxyzine as needed from here on out.",Laylalady
6,Hydroxyzine Pamoate,Sedation,2.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"January 9, 2022",0,It definitely helped me sleep longer. 9 hours instead of 5 or 6 but I woke up groggy and out of sorts. Throughout the day I felt my brain was not being sharp (so forgetful and feeling lost) and then I got a terrible headache and ended up going to bed at 3pm in the afternoon and slept on and off till the next day. the second day was emotional and very confusing laced with tiredness.This all on one 25mg pill. Never again will I take this medication. I am calling these pills 'crazy pills'. I will return them to the pharmacy.,jenna
7,Hydroxyzine Pamoate,Sedation,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"January 9, 2022",0,Most of the drugs only act in the ways they should without adverse events in about 60 to 70% of the population.  I made an Excel document and loaded every drug in it that I have an adverse reaction to. Then I looked up every drug on that list and entered into the Excel file which substrate is utilized in the CYP450 complex for each drug. It's amazing to me the side effects and adverse events I'm getting from drugs in different drug classes but they utilize the same CYP450 pathways. I digress. Even someone with my education gets panic attacks which all kinds of other therapies with top psychologists did not put a dent in. So I took 5 mg. I took half of a 10 mg pill. I slept for an entire day and I felt destroyed the next day. My eyes and mouth. Confusion. Scattered. Slow. Scary. I had to drive the next day. Unsafe.,Sarah

9,Hydroxyzine Pamoate,Sedation,5.0,,"December 13, 2021",1,"I was prescribed this to help me sleep around 3 years ago. 25 mg every night (or day if I was working overnight). While it did help me sleep well, I have gained 20 pounds over this time frame in spite of being an avid runner and weight lifter. I was feeling so hungry all the time. I would wake up in the middle of the night and shove my face and go back to bed. I did not link this to the antihistamine until recently. I’ve stopped for about a week, and it’s so much better. No more urges to shove my face full of food constantly. Beware if you take this drug and start having a huge appetite and weight gain.",NightShift

Haven't felt good since I took the drug, 2 months ago, and still have persistent problems. After researching, the drug is heavily linked to dementia, Parkinsonism, and cognitive decline. Then I find out the drug is banned in Canada because of permanent heart problems that can lead to death or heart failure because of Qt prolongation and torsade de pontes. This information should be discussed with the patient and warning labels on the bottles! Especially to prescribe to someone going through a little bout of insomnia.

I sleep well with it but notice I am in a bad mood ""snappy"" the next day.  I am also prescribed Klonopin which I take during the day as needed.  I notice I am having to take Klonopin more consistently to take the edgy feeling away.  I think also Vistaril is causing some mild depression.  I was on Trazodone at night for sleep for years but had to stop because it was causing panic attacks the next day; plus I felt drugged up.  My Dr prescribed Dayvigo recently buy I noticed that made me very hungry the next day as well I felt angry; sleep quality not that good.

I take two 25 mg at night and sleep most of the night. I am a little bit depressed when I wake up but that's because My psychiatrist didn't put me on any depression meds since I have an allergic reaction to several of them I am sure he could have tried me on something I hadn't taken before but he was more interested in getting to his next patience.

It knocks me out cold and I sleep, but I have zero energy the next day and feel groggy for hours after waking. I tried taking half the dosage, but the morning hangover and daytime exhaustion were still awful. I am better off just taking benadryl because then I'm not wiped out the next day.

I never took it before but I was desperate to calm down so I took it and within 10 minutes I was calm, relaxed and extremely sleepy. The only difference is I was EXTREMELY itchy on this and I complained to my nurse but she said it STOPS itching, but it did the opposite for me. It made me even more paranoid and made me nauseous so eventually I fell asleep and when I woke up, I still felt groggy and clumsy.

So the next day I cut my dose in half thinking it'd stop the grogginess the next day. Still had the vivid dream and grogginess. So last night I took another half and had a dream that was so vivid and violent. I dreamed about murders of several people and hid the murders. I also dreamed that if anyone witnessed them then I  threatened them .  I had a lot of tossing and turning. My systems are getting worse. So I'm going to  have to stop taking these. The only good thing I got out of these are the increase appetite and calming my nerves. So my appetite issue was definitely anxiety.

The next night two hours after I took the first 25mg I was tossing & turning trying to get to sleep so I ended up taking another 25mg and that got me to sleep pretty quickly but with a very vivid scary dream. For both nights it’s given me 6 hours of sleep before I woke up to pee and then an additional 3-4 hours. Both nights have made me pee like crazy idk if it’s a side effect of the drug & at night or what because it doesn’t happen during the day, and unlike most comments when I wake up it doesn’t make me feel groggy, more spacey.
