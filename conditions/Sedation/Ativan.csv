0,Ativan,Sedation,,Taken for less than 1 month,"February 12, 2022",0,"My husband went to hospital for afib they gave him 4 doses of ativan a day to claim him down.  Well, a few days later his heart stopped.  He has COPD giving him ativan slowed his breathing and his heart stopped.   He went in the hospital walking, talking, eating, no oxygen needed came out not being able to eat or do anything on oxygen 24/7 now.   This drug is dangerous, and the fact that hospital overdosed him sending him into cardiac arrest.",Bad experience
1,Ativan,Sedation,4.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"April 12, 2020",8,agree with post above - xanax or klonopin are similar and stronger; will get the job done better.  and Klonopin isprobably the better  than xanax; many reports showx is more addictive but k is more effective. ,fusebird
2,Ativan,Sedation,10.0,,"January 11, 2017",27,"52 year old diagnosed with ovarian cancer in July 2016. Received chest mediport in August and went through 12 weeks of chemo. Only side effects were constipation from chemo and sleepless nights from Dedcadron. While these steroids made me feel strong and allow me to work while taking chemo they also keep me wired at night. Only on those days of chemo I would take 1  mg of Ativan at night. So blessed to get some much needed rest and was at work by 6:00 ready for my work day. Feeling rested and getting that quality sleep is very vital when fighting this disease and taking chemo. I just had IP port surgically implanted into abdomen today. Staring next 3 cycles of IP chemo after having surgery December 8th.Ativan has helped me, no side effects.",FightingANDWILLWin

5,Ativan,Sedation,5.0,,"December 5, 2009",55,"Ativan was prescribed to me for severe anxiety. I took 2mg one to two times daily. I took the medication for two months. I however, DID NOT follow the advise of my doctor and quit cold turkey. It was five days of hell for me. I did not sleep AT ALL,  I had panic attacks, trouble breathing, and severe sweating for two more weeks when I did start sleeping again. The medication was very helpful but when I quit the side effects were just about unbearable. My advice is use this medication with caution and follow doctor instructions to the latter.",Anonymous
6,Ativan,Sedation,10.0,,"November 14, 2009",39,Ativan is the best drug ever prescribed to me. I take 2 mg twice a day. It calms me during the day and at night I sleep like a baby. There are no side effects when you wake as well.,extacy
7,Ativan,Sedation,10.0,,"November 5, 2009",37,Ativan has been a God send for me during these stressful times. It has helped me sleep better and has helped with my anxiety because of the stress I'm under. My doctor has prescribed 1mg x 2 a day as needed and that seems like the perfect dose for me. I also use pain medicines for prior spine surgery and have had no problem with this medication.,trieded
