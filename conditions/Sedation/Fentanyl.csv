1,Fentanyl,Sedation,,,"August 1, 2019",9,Severe hallucinations and disoriented during recovery after 9 hour back surgery.   Give me NO more please.,Backpostop
2,Fentanyl,Sedation,7.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"March 8, 2019",10,"Husband is a stage 4 SCLC patient. They gave him this in the ICU when ventilated for sedation.  They kept him on it after then vent came off for pain management. For pain relief it was as good as most of the other things he has been on (no better than Diluad, or Oxy). He had horrific hallucinations when taking a very small dose IV. He was having delusions. (He told a nurse he was an undercover bounty hunter at the hospital to serve a warrant). Less than a week after beginning it, he ripped his NG tube out because a  'monster' was sitting on him and 'shoving tentacles' down his nose. Thankfully it was just the NG tube not his PICC line in the jugular. The medical staff had NO IDEA it could cause hallucinations. I discovered it was a infrequent but noted side effect. They placed him back on the Diluad after this and his hallucinations subsided.",Cancer Wife
3,Fentanyl,Sedation,1.0,,"March 13, 2018",23,"My mother received a fentanyl ""cocktail.""  She left the ICU three weeks later after a horrific reaction to the anesthetic, hallucinating, her math skills regressed to kindergarten level, verbal skills mildly impaired, and required six months of OT, PT, and speech language pathology.  She could not live alone, drive, balance her checkbook, shop, or cook  -- all ""activities of daily living"" that she excelled at before entering the hospital.  Before another outpatient surgery, we instructed the anesthesiologist, verbally and in writing, NOT to use fentanyl, as it was determined to be the ingredient that she was allergic to.  They used it anyway.  This time, despite arriving, walking, speaking and eating, she left the hospital a month later in a wheelchair, with a feeding tube, never again to speak, ambulate, or be independent!  One should NEVER use it  without first having a FULL allergic reaction assessment by a first-rate allergy reaction assessment clinic.  Deeply Distraught Still.",Distraught Ph.D. daughter
4,Fentanyl,Sedation,10.0,,"January 30, 2009",28,I just had 4 Wisdom teeth cut out on 1/29/09. Before the surgery they injected Fentanyl through my I.V. injection. After they gave me the injection I went about 10 feet down the hall and everything went relaxed and peaceful. I would say this is a wonderful drug for sedation.,Josh W-S
