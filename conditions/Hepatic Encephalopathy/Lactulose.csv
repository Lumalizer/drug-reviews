0,Lactulose,Hepatic Encephalopathy,10.0,,"July 20, 2021",5,My dr said this would soften stool. Well it does do that. Like liquid water in a matter of hours. Stayed up all night on the pot with constant diarrhea and some seriously explosive gas but I felt a lot better by morning,Smiley
1,Lactulose,Hepatic Encephalopathy,3.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"May 15, 2019",22,"I started out on Lactulose when I found out I had Cirrhosis. That medicine tasted awful and I had to take it 3 times a day! I mixed it with everything under the sun but no relief from that nasty stuff. After taking it for months ( I had to take it) I asked my Gastrologist if there was ANYTHING else that I could take, he prescribed XIFAXAN which does the same thing. WISH I KNEW THAT BEFORE! LOL It comes as a tablet and is so easy to take. The only downside is that it’s very expensive. I don’t know if this will help anyone else, but it was A LOT better than taking that nasty liquid.",CBEAR
2,Lactulose,Hepatic Encephalopathy,,,"December 3, 2017",29,"My wife started getting dehydrated at the beginning  of this year and I repeatedly took her to the urgent care for  rehydration.Her symptoms would go away but come back three weeks later.During a hospital stay  in Aug 2017,my wife was given Reglan  in her IV to treat nausea  with disastrous results.She immediately forgot where she was,who I was or that she was in the hospital.mThis lasted 24 hours but the incident left her with profound hallucinations for about three weeks.She got dehydrated again-got over medicated on hyperidol and then got a blood test that pinged on ammonia.It all fits.The Reglan  damaged my wife’s already overworked liver and shes been dying of ammonia poisoning ever since .Lactulose may be  a Godsend.We hope so.",Old Phil
3,Lactulose,Hepatic Encephalopathy,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"January 10, 2015",100,"Generlac (lactulose):Initial symptoms included brain fog, disorientation, and confusion. I took the lactulose for one week... all symptoms disappeared. However, I must advise you to stay close to the bathroom. Also, I should note that my physician said that I may be taking this medication for the rest of my life and I'm only 47 years old.",kmo
4,Lactulose,Hepatic Encephalopathy,,,"February 13, 2012",73,Very effective! Usually starts to work for me within two hours and continues to work for hours. Stay close to a bathroom. It decreased blood ammonia level and cleared up the cloudy head in just a couple of days. Stress staying close to a bathroom!,stenforce
