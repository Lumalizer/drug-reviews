0,Xifaxan,Hepatic Encephalopathy,,Taken for less than 1 month,"July 19, 2021",4,"I just received my first bottle. I put Lactoloose on my drug allergies list! I have alcoholic cirrhosis. Quit drinking 4 years ago. My liver & portal vein are permanently damaged but are thankful my condition has stabilized! I still have toxic ammonia levels. I have been in a ""mental fog"" for years. Forgetful, mentally confused, poor motor skills, disorientation, (doesn't help I have bad vertigo too) you name it. I didn't know what it was from. Thought I was getting dementia, I'm 63. NOW I KNOW WHAT WAS CAUSING IT hepatic encephalopathy or HE. I only have Medicare Advantage and the co-pay was $840 a month! Couldn't afford it. MY GI doc applied me for Bosch Assistance Program. I was APPROVED and received my 1st FREE bottle of Xifaxan 550mg today. I am SO GRATEFUL!!! Can not WAIT to see if this fog lifts. Wish me luck.",NCIronMan
1,Xifaxan,Hepatic Encephalopathy,10.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"October 20, 2020",10,"Have been on this over 2 years. 100% satisfied. Have not returned to hospital, and ammonia levels have remained doable.",Joe59
2,Xifaxan,Hepatic Encephalopathy,,Taken for less than 1 month,"October 16, 2019",34,"I have been on Xifaxan for 1 month now. I'm on Medicare so you know that story. Took me 9 months to finally acquire. Before Xifaxan I spent my day like a dog chasing my tail. Has done a tremendous job on clearing up my thought process. Would like to add this comment, shame on you The Food and Drug Cartel. Who are the real criminals here?",SmokyHollow
3,Xifaxan,Hepatic Encephalopathy,10.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"September 18, 2019",24,"Hi I have end stage liver and could not use bathroom  for a bowel motion unless I took a bunch of lactulose to go, and when I did it was crazy I pooped my  brains out. But I was having a problem because it would make me a prisoner in my home. Then I tried Xifaxan and after taking for three days no result, fourth day bingo and I stayed using it and it was more tolerable than lactose. So I feel much better. So I go to my gastroenterologist and told him it worked great but I now have heart failure """" not good"""" ",Peewee
4,Xifaxan,Hepatic Encephalopathy,8.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"June 22, 2019",19,"My HE (hepatic encephalopathy) did 180 degree change on Xifaxan.  Better mentally, peaceful, actually.  My wife and my friends noticed the improvement in me after 2 weeks on 550mg, twice a day.  Still take lactulose because cirrhosis is stage 4.",Jackie boy
5,Xifaxan,Hepatic Encephalopathy,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"August 15, 2017",24,Ridiculous price. Makes using it prohibitive. Salix should be ashamed of themselves. Lactulose worked very well and totally affordable.,Mysickliver
6,Xifaxan,Hepatic Encephalopathy,,,"August 3, 2017",33,"$1375 with ins and ins won't cover but $12.50.  Highway robbery and not worth it in my opinion.  Will try and fix some other way.  Drug companies should be ashamed and BC/BS should be abolished.  You all high and mighty CEOs need to think about the patients,",Kahuna57
7,Xifaxan,Hepatic Encephalopathy,,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"January 17, 2017",39,"The whole premise of offering a life saving drug to patients, only to change the policy after the first years trial was successful. This company should not be allowed to offer a life-saving drug, gain notoriety and good press when in actuality, the patients that are responsible for the ""trial"" are just completely dismissed. The majority of people with digestive health issues this bad, are seniors. So for the company Salix to offer this and promote any kind of Affordability is just sad. Morally and ethically wrong for business. Who can afford a prescription that costs the Customer $750 A MONTH. As if that itself weren't bad enough, (that is a rent or mortgage payment) the company acknowledges that they do not and will not accept medicare.",oLturner
8,Xifaxan,Hepatic Encephalopathy,10.0,,"January 13, 2017",16,"I completely agree...miracle drug.  If I stop taking this for any reason I WILL get sick.  In combination with Lactulose, I feel like a new person.  Thank you to the docs that figured this out!!!",Kelpet1
9,Xifaxan,Hepatic Encephalopathy,10.0,,"December 8, 2016",37,Miracle drug is the first comment that comes to mind . I have end stage liver disease and currently wait patiently on the transplant list . I cannot explain my life or more even my unbearable existence I have undergone in the last several years . I began having difficulty with concentrating and unable to focus . I was so frustrated with myself living a life of total confusion to a point that I was in constant fear . My long term physician prescribed the medication to decrease the ammonia elevated by my failing liver . I was at a point that I was so depressed and had no desire to wake up in the mornings .  I began taking the medication in disbelief and only as a last resort . I need more room to elaborate my response,Bon King
10,Xifaxan,Hepatic Encephalopathy,,Taken for less than 1 month,"July 23, 2016",23,"I am Stage 4 Cirrohsis, diagnosed with Hepatic Encephalopothy. Started Xifaxan about a week ago. I was concerned with a few comments from a different doc about this medication. I'm glad I found this site because I feel so much better reader about your experiances. I am so looking forward to feeling better!",RobinLP
11,Xifaxan,Hepatic Encephalopathy,10.0,,"January 30, 2015",57,"I had taken Lactulose for almost 5 yrs before Xifaxan came out.  I had a lot of diarrhea and general bloating and abdominal discomfort with Lactulose.  That all disappeared when I started Xifaxan, and I would encourage patients to do themselves a favor and improve their quality of life by asking their doc for Xifaxan.  My ammonia is  <25, better than when I took Lactulose, and my feeling of well-being is 10 out of 10.",heppercat
