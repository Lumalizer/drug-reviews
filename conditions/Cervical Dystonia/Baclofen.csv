0,Baclofen,Cervical Dystonia,6.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"November 7, 2021",2,"Where do I begin, this medication actually saved me, my dystonia started to getting worse I didn't know I had, since 2009 the doctors brushed it off, until I was referred to a neurologist, my head kept twisting to the right I had to use my hand to keep it straight, I had arthritis in my neck so the twisting made it worse over the years, this medication I take 20.5 x3 three times per day, If I don't take 7 hours apart my muscles sure let me know, my back would just spasm but now its my legs , feet, neck, face, head, arms, abdom, its my entire body but different parts at different times. I find the spasms are worse when I'm cold, I get extreme dizziness, I take gravol, my body feels heavy swollen but I'm not, extreme nerve pain, have had steroid and botox injections if I get a high dosage it works, the procedure of steroid is very painful, so yes the drug is worth the effects verse management",SHELLEY

3,Baclofen,Cervical Dystonia,5.0,Taken for 10 years or more,"July 4, 2018",14,I take 10mg baclofen before sleep when I need to unclench jaw muscles before sleep - it makes me sleepy also and usually I worry less bout loss of muscle control. Any more than 10mgs turns me into a forget everything nodding off zombie but thank heavens there's something that relaxes my face if only for a little while.,CJ
4,Baclofen,Cervical Dystonia,5.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"March 18, 2018",16,I am prescribed baclofen 20 mgs 3xs a day..I had to cut that dosage back as this med causes extreme lethargy and sleepiness.  It does very little for the horrific muscle spasms..but? Telling doctors this is like talking to a wall..so I use it as my sleep aid because Drs. Do not want to prescribe anything for that either..can't win..,Haji Bob

8,Baclofen,Cervical Dystonia,8.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"December 27, 2016",26,"After trying several muscle relaxants, w very little success, I read a monograph from NSTA noting success in a limited study. Tried it 10mg 3x/day and it is equal to off-label benzodiazipines. NOTE: It does NOT improve pain from any underlying damage, only that directly related to the spasms!! It also improved my sleep by lessening nighttime stiffness (I also take 500mg magnesium at bedtime)Side effects are tolerable however- Do not take with narcotics or alcohol ",JD in FL
