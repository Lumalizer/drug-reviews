0,Botox,Cervical Dystonia,8.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"March 18, 2022",0,"I had been getting botox injections for three years for my cervical dystonia, and it helped tremendously but my last three injections caused respiratory failure. I had trouble swallowing, speaking and breathing ,the last time I got injected 2 weeks later I   was asleep, rolled over on my side and as I did I tried to swallow and could not. I couldn't catch my breath, panicked, I was gasping for air, 4 hours I was gasping for air. I thought I was going to die.  That was my last time I got botox injections. Has anyone else experienced these symptoms?  I was getting 12 injections every visit to neurologist ,about 6 vials.  It did help with my twisting neck but now I'm scared to go back. My pain is off the charts, got an appointment with pain management to see if pain pills will help. Has anyone tried pain pills? Do they work?",rex
1,Botox,Cervical Dystonia,7.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"December 2, 2021",0,"Friday 26th Nov I had botox injections all at 300 units  for a focal segmental myoclonus. A neurologist gave me 3 injections in my neck for a twitch to the right, one on the left hand side under the jaw and 2 in the back of the  neck on the right hand side. My neck was very stiff in this area. I also had 3 further injections 1 in the front of the shoulder 1 in the back of the shoulder and one in my side, which felt like in between a rib area. The second three injections were done with the use of the machine. I have read in the reviews that it is better to ask the neurologist to use the machine that reads the electrical activity. Am I right that the neurologist who gave me the first 3 jabs was just trying for pot luck ie not using the machine whilst the other, maybe his second in command did the job correctly?Initially the first night I felt I had an improvement, but since then it has got much worse. Although I can hear you all saying give it time, I was told 10 days. Any recommendations?",unnykop

I switched to xeomin (not much better) when it comes to post injection side effects. The injections themselves do not hurt but 3 days after the injections the spasms, swelling and pain are unbearable for about 2 weeks.

But after getting botox, for the most part it is ok.  The key in my experience has been the quality of the neurologist administering it.  I have had many.  Mapping is essential. But then it necessary to know exactly where in the mapped muscle to inject. A well trained doctor can do this by feel.  Others resort to EMG machines, which adds unnecessary pain. Many just guess and shoot.  Botox is too dangerous and expensive to use haphazardly.  It is a terrific remedy when done properly. I get 400 units every 3 1/2 months. But I just lost my excellent neurologist to Covid and the new one has no sense of where to inject. I supplement with massage therapy which helps my neck and back, but not head pain.  Drugs did nothing or had horrendous side affects.  Thinking of trying LLLT (cold laser).  Anyone have experience with this?",catlet1066

When I see people say it doesn't work for me I often wonder if it's a case of the whether the person doing the injections  is not getting a good result, going by my own experience.

Targeted many different & small muscles.  My husband has had about 3 rounds with the new MD.  Previously, his head was severely tilted to one side.  Now the head is almost perfectly straight.  He still has neck pain, but maybe the pain will improve with time since this is new doctor.  He also receives physical therapy from an excellent provider.  The physical therapy is not merely heat or cold pack, electric stimulation. It involves active patient participation, stretching, strengthening. No traction.

After initial treatments felt like I had the flu and felt ill. Also made vestibular issues worse for a time because all mechanisms are related. Still unable to do actvity do to combination of issues although the Botox is definitely helping. Anyone suffering from head injury or whiplash be sure to get assessed for neuro-vestibular and neuro-ophthalmology issues .. also certified physiotherapist specializing in upper ceevical spine.

I am getting cramping at the back of my head near the hairline. Difficultly turning my head to the right (making it hard to reverse when driving). My throat is swollen it is hard to eat.

I would like to recommend a wonderful organization that I joined in the beginning that really provided a lot of useful information.  The National Spasmodic Torticollis Association has a yearly weekend symposium where they have noted speakers & doctors talking on dystonia & the newest breakthroughs.

The head drop I had after many of the shots, and had to put my hand under my chin when I was walking to keep my head up.  My doctor managed to get it perfect (with little to no side effects) maybe 4 times out of the 10-12 times I was injected. Then I went into remission for 4 years.

I have to say when I get the shots and they hurt really bad they seem to work better I know that sounds crazy but its because she is getting the muscle that is causing the dystonia to act up.

I am 74 now and thanksto this site and others, I diagnosed myself and got referral to a wonderful neurologist.  I got my first injection last week, and for thefirst time since I was a kid, I feel like a kid again.  It's not perfect, but Inever knew perfect.  No more pain, and I can walk again and not think about my neck.  I wish I had this before I left my wonderful job on a handicapped pension. It gave me my life back.",feistyoldlady

My Doctor suggested Botox for both and I can hardly contain my emotions when someone asks how I'm doing. Even now, my eyes are full of grateful tears...I have a LIFE again! Everyday used to be a struggle, but not anymore! To wake up without a migraine, or pain is like a miracle...No it IS a miracle! I love my Doctor for suggesting it. I love Allegan for making it available.If your Doctor says you're a good candidate, or you think you might be, ASK! It might change your LIFE!",Queenofa
52,Botox,Cervical Dystonia,1.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"November 6, 2013",52,"I received injections in neck, shoulders and calf.  Serious side effects of feeling like I have been poisoned for 1-2 weeks after the injections.  I still have incredible pain and muscle weakness.  My calf muscle still cramped and knotted.  Difficulty swallowing at times.  I really don't know if it worked at all for me.  It's been a year and I still am wondering what benefits I am receiving.",janij
53,Botox,Cervical Dystonia,8.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"February 8, 2013",51,"This is probably the best solution to cervical dystonia out there, other than physical therapy. While it didn't take all my pain away, my headaches subsided tremendously! I highly recommend getting this done. It is only needed every 3 to 4 months, and the injections aren't too painful to sit through.",SammiWilson

55,Botox,Cervical Dystonia,6.0,,"September 1, 2009",40,"I have cervical dystonia and have been treated with Botox for 2.5 years. Botox had many many side effects for me in the beginning.  Trouble swallowing, severe headaches, floppy head.  It does take away the spasms where it is injected but I am finding help with trigger point injections and osteopathic adjustments.  They don't stop as much of the pain but they have less side effects than Botox.",Anonymous
56,Botox,Cervical Dystonia,9.0,,"August 20, 2009",95,"I was diagnosed with Cervical Dystonia after months of pain and a few years of wondering what was happening to me. It came to the point where I was depressed and exhausted all of the time and felt things would never ever get better for me. After different medicines, physical therapy and acupuncture I finally was sent to a Neurologist who confirmed my Dystonia and started Botox injections. The first treatment had no effect as they had to start with a small dose so one vile. I had to wait 2.5 months before I could receive another treatment and at that point was given 3 viles. I finally found relief and got my life back. My Dystonia will probably forever affect me but with the Botox I can barely notice it. It is truly a medical miracle that this works.",Smoore013

58,Botox,Cervical Dystonia,8.0,,"May 5, 2008",93,i HAVE FINALLY FOUND AN MD. THAT KNOWS WHERE TO INJECT IT.  I almost gave up after 2 and 1/2 years of failures by guessing Dr.s who didn't really know where to inject.  They were always hitting the opposite side of my neck thinking that was where the problem lied... finally found a dr. who knew where to inject it.  Now I have been straight necked for the first time in 25 years.  Hell yes it works and no side effects... but for some reason I still have the pain (radiculopathy) on left side.,LYONMOOSE
