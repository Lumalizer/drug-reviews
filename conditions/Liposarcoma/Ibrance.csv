1,Ibrance,Liposarcoma,3,,"July 11, 2019",11,"My husband started taking Ibrance 100mg yesterday, July 10, 2019 around 11:30a.m.. Within a few minutes his face was numb. We ate lunch, he said the pork chop wasn't good and tasted funny. The numbness ended up covering his body head to toe, and he felt stoned. He looked stoned, like he wanted to sleep, this lasted all day. We went to bed around 11p.m. and it was starting to wear off, then during the night he felt like he had pins and needles all over, and said it hurt. He also had chills several times throughout the day.  He is still sleeping this morning so I'm not sure how he feels. I did contact the doctors office and they said for him not to take anymore today and made an appointment for next Tuesday. They also said when he gets up if he still has numbness to go to the ER, if not he can stay home but no more Ibrance until he comes in. They want to monitor him after he takes it. He doesn't normally take meds so I'm not sure if this is why it affects him in this way.",Jukebox's wife
