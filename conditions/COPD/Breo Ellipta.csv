0,Breo Ellipta,COPD,10.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"February 9, 2022",0,"I have been on Breo for 2 years, no more visits to the emergency hospital and  a lot less Ventolin is needed. After all tests and 40 years of using  ventolin, flovent, pulmicort,I have tried so many . My main issue was always related to bronchospasms that the other pumps would not treat. I overdosed on Flovent and ended up with thrush so many times along with pumping ventolin 20 times a day in crises to end up on the hospital several times per year due to allergy flare ups and cold weather flare ups.  Breo really made my life easier, I cannot live without it anymore and now use ventolin 4 to 5 times a week instead of those 4 times per day.  Really worth trying !!",Happy breather
1,Breo Ellipta,COPD,9.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"February 15, 2021",1,I have been using Breo for about 3 years and now it has went up to $490.99 for 30 days. Who can afford it. I'm it works so well and now I can't afford to buy it. Help,dawn
2,Breo Ellipta,COPD,10.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"December 12, 2020",6,"With weather changes I get a cough, mild asthma. Was using my rescue inhaler, sometimes more than once a day, especially when it rains. Dr put me on Breo and I haven't coughed since, going on 3 months. Only fault is the price, insurance does cover some of the cost.",Shorty
3,Breo Ellipta,COPD,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"September 13, 2020",10,"My primary doctor had her assistant go downstairs to the pharmacy to get this inhaler because I was breath distress.  It did not help at all and it cost me $348 which I had to pay out of pocket because it is a Tier 3 medication. After using it 3 times, my face and hands began to swell.  I cannot use it and it is upsetting that I had to pay so much money for it. Albuterol works and my RX plan covers it with a small co-pay.  I also much say that it is difficult to use. There are far better medications and inhalers than Breo Ellipta.",MusicLady

5,Breo Ellipta,COPD,10.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"August 5, 2020",11,I have been on Breo for 4 years and my breathing improved from the very beginning. I use it only once a day instead of 4 x a day for Symbicort. (I tried 2 or 3 others over the years). The only negative is muscle cramps at night. I take OTC Potassium to counter balance the cramps.  The leg cramps were worse with the Symbicort and Albutorol.  Breo is tolerable and the best I have found so far.,Pat
6,Breo Ellipta,COPD,1.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"February 24, 2020",58,"66 yrs old Severe COPD 48% lungs..Went on Breo and Ventolin on 12-31-19 after a couple of weeks I started to have bad neck pains, lots of muscle pains, I use a CPAP and started to have sleeping problems, actually started using a cane because I fell couple of times. I’m a Type 2 diabetic and my A1C went up from 6.5 to 8.7 in 7 weeks, but the worst was the depression.  I constantly had really bad dark thoughts to the point of actually planning how to do it so it wouldn’t be as bad for family, went to my Pulmonary Dr who sent me to my regular Dr who wanted to Baker Act me. So I stopped my Breo cold turkey and hoping that would kill me faster, but to my amazement within 5 days I’m back to my normal self before Breo, no suicide thoughts, no mood problems, sleeping like a baby again, no cane still having breathing issues but Ventolin seems to help with out side effects..these Drs never even thought Breo might be the problem..Breo is a very dangerous drug!!!",Al
7,Breo Ellipta,COPD,10.0,,"October 30, 2019",19,"OMG. Rescue inhaler wasn't enough any more. I was hesitant to be put on all kinds if meds. Well, I had no choice. The wheezing and coughing were unbearable. Not only to me but all those around me. Day or night. By the third day of using this no more use of inhaler. I have  it always with me. So far GREAT! Hopefully I won't get negative side effects.",fofo
8,Breo Ellipta,COPD,10.0,,"May 15, 2019",25,"I tried Incruse, still coughed and need rescue inhaler. Tried stiolto, coughed more and need rescue inhaler. Ended up in ER and hospital over nite. 6 nebulizer treatments. Tried breo, perfect.  I  haven't used rescue inhaler past year. 1 puff a day rinse mouth, minimum side effects.",tom
9,Breo Ellipta,COPD,7.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"April 18, 2019",22,"I've been using Breo Ellipta for a couple of years - I have COPD. It works well to help me breathe. However, I experience dizziness sometimes when I take it. So I tend to not take it as I'm supposed to take it. I drive for a living and I can't drive if I'm dizzy. I won't risk it. This makes my employer pissed off, but hey at least I can breathe. I get hoarseness also. But it works. Its stops the wheezing. So I can sleep.",Breezy
10,Breo Ellipta,COPD,,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"April 1, 2019",18,"It has not worked for me. Blurred vision, lethargy, sore throat, vocal changes( hoarseness), tremor, difficulty in concentration are amongst the S/E experienced. Further, a persistent chest infection, which may be related to using Stelara for Crohn's Disease may have had some influence on the outcome.  I'll get by with Atrovent!",Merv s
11,Breo Ellipta,COPD,10.0,,"February 24, 2019",18,"So far, so good. I am very impressed with the results. I am breathing better than I have for quite some time and I use my rescue inhaler infrequently. My wife commented that she hadn't heard me cough at all today and my wheezing has stopped. I have experienced no side effects to speak of. The first time I took it my heart rate was elevated for a while but that's the only time it happened. I have been on it for a month.",MMc
12,Breo Ellipta,COPD,2.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"May 14, 2018",21,I used Breo one time only. It felt like I had drunk five cups of coffee. This medicine thoroughly effected my nervous system. I can't live like I'm drugged up for two seconds. I would rather take a short acting inhaler than feel drugged all the time. Breo is not for me.,Mike M.
13,Breo Ellipta,COPD,3.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"May 5, 2018",25,"Cough became better 1st week, by 2nd week it worsened, muscles ached the 1st week & continued to throughout use, as well as in the AM my joints were very stiff! By the 3rd week I had a continuous sore throat & couldn't wear my rings and my shoes were cutting into my feet and were red! My eyes began to burn & my nose swelled, turning bright red, like a triangle, the redness faded after 24 hrs! My family complained that I was miserable & I felt angry daily by the 3rd week and my eczema flared up and I developed intense scalp itching. When I experienced stomach cramps on & off over 3 weeks and was constantly hungry I knew this wasn't a coincidence! I have asthma, COPD, & Bronchitis",Wms
14,Breo Ellipta,COPD,9.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"March 1, 2018",20,Breo works extremely well.  I still get out of breath in stressful moments or venturing out and about.  But the results are very good.  I have suggested other COPD patients look into this medicine.,JLH
15,Breo Ellipta,COPD,2.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"November 9, 2017",14,"Breo eliptica  improved my breathing greatly, however the  side effects were extreme. I had 2 episodes of double vision, one while driving and extreme back pain to the point when I could not walk.",Ian Scott
16,Breo Ellipta,COPD,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"November 3, 2017",32,My Dad was put on Breo for his COPD however he had asthma as well. The breo made him worse and the doctor told him it needed to get into his system for it to work properly. Well after being on it for 3 weeks he died!,Anonymous
17,Breo Ellipta,COPD,,Taken for less than 1 month,"October 21, 2017",40,"I have been taking Breo for approx 3 weeks, previously using Atrovent. I have severe COPD. Aged 67. The first day or two it felt excellent was able to breathe easier, but then the side effects started. Tolerated the headaches, bone aches, red eyes, slightly blurred vision sometimes, confusion to start with, severe sinus (was regularly blowing blood from nose), feeling lethargic and depressed, getting cold sweats at night, thirsty, ringing ears, runny nose, but when my face started to swell up that scared me so stopped use, all adverse reactions now stopped after 36 hours. It is great for helping with the breathing, unfortunately side affects are too much. Funny thing breathing has continued to be good after stopped taking",GrannyJanet
18,Breo Ellipta,COPD,,,"October 13, 2017",13,I have been on BREO for a short time and already can feel the difference with it.   I am not as short winded as I was and don't have to use my inhaler as much as before maybe 2 time a day..  I am glad my Doctor put me on it.,K>I>S>S>
19,Breo Ellipta,COPD,10.0,,"April 16, 2017",32,"I've only been using it for two weeks.  Other than a scratchy throat (which I recently learned to gargle with water after use), I feel INCREDIBLY better.  I'm 60 and was diagnosed with emphysema about 1 year ago.  I'm a desk jockey but a ""weekend warrior"" in the back forty.  I haven't felt this good in quite some time.  Fingers crossed...",Mark K.

21,Breo Ellipta,COPD,3.0,,"December 15, 2016",30,I was put on Breo and was amazed on how well I  felt but it didn't last long. My symptoms were getting worse and it wasn't until I had wisdom teeth pulled that I  realized that Breo was making me worse. After having my wisdom teeth pulled out I was scared  to use my inhaler. I was told no straws because the sucking in cold pull stitches out so the day after I didn't use Breo the next day I couldn't belive how well I could breath and each day was even better. I was using my rescue inhaler once every 4/5 hours and I  felt good so even though at first Breo seemed good over time it didn't agree with me. I'm  seeing my respitalogist next week to see what's next for me as the rescue inhaler is not enough.,Brrenna
22,Breo Ellipta,COPD,10.0,,"September 7, 2016",36,I have struggled with asthma my whole life. I used my inhaler on average 10 times a day. I started Breo it started working right away.  By day 3 I noticed that I hadn't used my inhaler all day.  Using Breo has given me tremendous relief! I love it and it has seriously given me a better quality of life.,Jenna22
23,Breo Ellipta,COPD,9.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"August 28, 2016",30,"Since I started using Breo I still need a maintenance dose of 20 mg of prednisone, but I rarely use my rescue inhaler, and my nebulizing has gone from once every 4 hours to once every 8 hours. At Stage 4 COPD, this medication has given me tremendous relief.",Saskew
24,Breo Ellipta,COPD,5.0,,"July 23, 2016",39,"I was excitied to try the Breo Ellipta.. I have severe emphysema & 73 years old.. At first I found that I could breathe longer during the day without using my rescue Proair so much during the day... After 6 days, I found that when excerting myself for a longer period of time, ( grocery shopping) that I would run out of air...My chest felt tight & my Proair didn't seem to rescue me as before...It was a little frightening...",islandmoon
25,Breo Ellipta,COPD,10.0,,"May 11, 2016",38,"I have tried most all maintance inhalers due to the fact I was using my rescue inhaler way to much throughout the day. After many failed attempts at all the others I was given a sample of breo, not expecting much of a differance, boy was I wrong. I could tell on the 2nd day it was working! I breath soooo much better and can go without my resue ventalin ..HUGE differance!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",Jmsef
26,Breo Ellipta,COPD,9.0,,"May 7, 2016",37,At the end of my first month. Thank god for this med!! Breo has been great! Haven't used my nebulizer and rescue inhaler has only been used 2 or 3 times. I am so grateful for the 12 month free prescription as well..no insurance to cover it and I was very very ill. My wheezing is gone and I'm not coughing! It's a miracle :),SGK55
27,Breo Ellipta,COPD,10.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"April 18, 2016",44,"I have been on prednisone 21 years non stop for a still unknown lung condition. I have tried so many different meds, specialists, treatments, etc. No matter what I still coughed, wheezed, couldn't breathe. The best combo so far was 20-30mg prednisone daily and Advair 500/50. I have not been able to get off prednisone for 21 years. If I tried, I ended up in the hospital within 48hrs. My insurance quit covering Advair, so my dr prescribed Breo. I am now on day 7 of NO PREDNISONE! Seven days! I am ecstatic! 21 years of prednisone has wrecked havoc on my body, but I havent taken it in 7 days! And I even took my dog for a walk yesterday! I dont know how its working when nothing else has, but it is!",Boobear73
28,Breo Ellipta,COPD,8.0,,"January 16, 2016",39,I have used Breo for 1 month now and must day.... WOW.. I can give up my nebulizer which was every 4 hours ..yes nightly also... once a day... almost normal again. ps.. Breo is new... I had to tell my MD about it.. she gave me a 12 month free trial prescription card...... hope this helps!,JoeGailey
29,Breo Ellipta,COPD,10.0,,"March 24, 2015",91,"Used Symbicort for a few years and was very pleased with it but  then I tried the Breo Ellipta. I thought Symbicort was very good but the Breo was out standing. I felt like I did 20 years ago before all of this started. I could mow the yard and function without any moments of shortness of breath - it is a really great treatment. The Tudorza Pressair (aclidinium bromide) just doesn't work. I felt light headed a lot and had a difficult time concentrating - felt very tired with it, and it just isn't working. The Breo is so very expensive - wish there was a way to get it without deciding if you are going to buy food or your Breo medication.",Morgany
30,Breo Ellipta,COPD,10.0,,"January 25, 2015",74,I use Breo with Spiriva once per day.  Haven't used rescue inhaler since I started taking the Breo.  Love it!,Miss Piggy15
