0,Prednisone,COPD,9.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"August 31, 2021",4,"I've used Prednisone when released from hospital after an COPD exacerbation. Tapered from 40mg per day down to 2.5mg per day over 2 weeks.  Helped immensely! I'm now stage 4 and just moving without being breathless is difficult.  I am now taking 5 mg per day as a long term aid and it really helps significantly without terrible side effects. Some mild mood swings and minor fluid retention comes with it, but really rather mild. I'll put up with them while actually breathing 30% better!!!",Bill A.

Strengthens lungs and body, removes mucus and I am well for over 6 months with no use of inhaler. I have used this method three times now with great results",Chrissie
2,Prednisone,COPD,10.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"May 28, 2019",52,"During an exacerbation COPD I'm sure I'm dying. I have lost all energy and become breathless. I feel I've aged 25 years in days. With prednisone, I begin feeling normal again in 24 hours. I can breathe, taking in deep breaths. I can sleep all night without choking. I can be social with our coughing so much and so hard that I urinate myself. It is a godsend.",Emkue

4,Prednisone,COPD,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"April 20, 2019",7,"Had a terrible reaction. After day 1 I couldn't stop coughing and a lot of black phlegm came up. Day 3 I started to turn red, I got this during a holiday weekend and my doctor was out of town so I just finished the prescription. The experience was terrible and I was taking it for a lung infection. It didn't help.",Bert
5,Prednisone,COPD,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"January 16, 2019",20,"Other than suppressing my appetite, I don't get the bad reactions. But it sure helps me breath when I go through the occasional "" coughing"" spells, where I can barely catch my breath ! Even without insurance, it is a cheap drug too! ($8) Mine was 10 mg. Taper off about 11 days, total.",Cianne
6,Prednisone,COPD,1.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"October 5, 2018",23,"Unfortunately, I was an inpatient for 4 days for COPD & got hooked up to Pred in my IV, too sick to ? anything. I was sent home taking 60mg of the stuff! I was never warned about side effects, its contraindication w/ an MDD diagnosis, how it would destroy my fibromyalgia/anxiety/Inattentive ADD medication regimen efficacy, or that it would have to be slooowly tapered down. I've put on 30 lbs of weight in areas I never have before, like my neck & upper back. I have no idea how I'll lose it in time for my wedding in 6 months. After tapering down to 10 mg & just wanted to be done with it for good, I went off CT & 7 days in I couldn't urinate, eat, sleep, walk, lift anything or breathe. My hands, feet & calves swelled to 2x their normal size during this time. Having no other option, I went back on the Pred & within a day lost 15 lbs of fluid that my body held in during withdrawal. The depression, fear of becoming an invalid & excruciating pain of that week that put me in a dark place.",Ihateprednisone

9,Prednisone,COPD,9.0,,"January 15, 2017",106,Have been given Prednisone for severe back pain but was recently give 20mg dose for my COPD. I'm like a new man since taking it. The Dr. wanted me to stop taking it after a few months but there were side effects. I'm 68 years old and except for the COPD not in bad shape. I really don't understand why people my age who can have a much higher quality of life with a fairly mild medication as this are constantly being asked to stop taking it. I thought physicians took an oath to do no harm. This medication helps me breathe and I've grown very fond of it.... Breathing that is...,FjC

12,Prednisone,COPD,9.0,,"December 18, 2015",63,"Hacking deep dry cough woke me up in the middle of the night for days until I started the Prednisone taper yesterday.

14,Prednisone,COPD,8.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"September 15, 2014",116,"I have COPD.  Experienced an exacerbation of the condition one evening.  Went to ER.  Coughing, shortness of breath and difficult breathing.  I was given a Nebulizer treatment with the medication Albuterol Sulfate in ER and sent home with a Nebulizer machine to do the breathing treatment 2 x daily, AM and PM.  Also, given 2 Prednisone before leaving ER with prescription for 14 tabs taken at various intervals until gone. I really felt great, full of energy, but as down to last of the medicine, feeling very achy all over, rather flu like.  I know it is going off the Prednisone, as have taken it before some time ago, and you just kind of ""crash"" when you stop.",daxton
