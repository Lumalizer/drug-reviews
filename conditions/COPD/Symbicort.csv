7,Symbicort,COPD,10.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"April 9, 2020",23,"Symbicort is the best inhaler. You  receive immediate relief breathing and it relieves your breathing for extended period. The only problem is, the inhaler is very expensive. My doctor was giving me a free sample but they do not have anymore. I'm  trying Pro Air but it is not as effective.",BB

Prescribed Flovent, antibiotics, Nasonex, Pulmicort for sinusitis. Finally the docs decided to look at the lungs and prescribed Symbicort a few weeks ago.

My copay is $271 Received e-mail from symbicort that said if I printed it and took it to my pharmacy it would cost average $35 and maybe free . Pharmacist said if used symbicort card it would be $418. I think its just a scam to get my information,rac

18,Symbicort,COPD,9.0,,"July 30, 2018",43,Symbicort is good but company doing bad with patients by giving them 80% discount pass which is costlier than actual open Market price for example I am buy symbicort @ $241. On CVS.The company is giving symbicort value after 80% discount @$309.53Why they are deceiving innocent patients. If $309.53 is there 80% discounted price it's mean actual price is $1547.65 while I have bought it 4 times on $241. at CVS. It looks they are getting hidden benefits from any organization by showing that they have given millions of dollars discount to COPD patients. If you not publish it as it is I will go to other methods. They are answerable.,Hamid
19,Symbicort,COPD,10.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"July 21, 2018",43,"I've had asthma my entire adult life. It has always been bad. Winters were worse, summers not quite as bad as winters.My asthma/COPD has gotten worse the last two years. Summer is as bad as winter. I've been using Flovent with a rescue inhaler. Even with Flovent, I was using the rescue inhaler all the time. I couldn't sleep a night through without waking up needing the inhaler. I tried Advair, no better. So this last visit to my doctor, he put me on Symbicort. I've gone a month without needing the rescue inhaler. I haven't used it once! It's so freeing not having to worry if I'm running out of inhales. I couldn't do my job, enjoy the outdoors, be active without worrying I couldn't breathe. This has been a miracle medication for me.",kenth

I can walk to the back of my house 40 feet without having to stop to catch my breath, but still breathing heavily.  Prior, I had to stop every 15 feet or so to catch my breath.  Improvement?  Yes.  Better?  No.",AhappyCamper
22,Symbicort,COPD,5.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"November 20, 2016",31,"The medicine worked right off the bat, after 30 minutes or so, could breathe much better, and as a smoker, helped my wheezing go away, and not as tired with more energy. NOW the BAD part. I have had a heart attack and have 3 stents. For 3 years, my bp has been perfect at 110/65 with a pulse of 58 to 65 even drinking caffiene and smoking. Since starting this, BP has increased a little, but pulse no matter what stays above 110 24/7, SO, can't take it for that reason only...",Quando62
23,Symbicort,COPD,,,"October 21, 2016",29,"I have taken Sympbicort for over 1 year.  It works very well but I asked my lung dr if we could try another inhaler.  The side effect that caused me to stop taking it was horseness and scratchy throat.. My dr gave me anther inhaler to try/  Still with the throatt thing. I hope he comes up with something else but my expections aren't high.  All of this type of inhaler must do the same thing as far as side effects.",sandiee
24,Symbicort,COPD,1.0,,"August 25, 2016",41,I have used it one night and one day. Four inhales total. At first night. It causes laryngospasm. I almost choked. This horror is still with me two months passed. Even on day i had spasms. Mostly start with a cough. I am afraid if there is no cure for this. All my life changed. None of phsician knows this disease. They prescribe astma drugs. I searched on internet 13 cases reported so far. I am the 14th case. Stay away.,kccoskun
25,Symbicort,COPD,5.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"July 10, 2016",24,"worked really good but the side effects were unmanageable.  Rinsed, gargled as instructed but developed thrush and swallowing was very painful. Discontinued use but took over 6 months to get over side effects. Now on Advair  and am so scared of this happening again that I take right before a meal so that food will clean the esophagus of the medication. Hope new drugs being tested will result in a drug as good as Symbicort but without the side effects! Are there any patches or injections available as I have severe Gerd and pills and inhalers cause me extreme pain.",dancier
26,Symbicort,COPD,10.0,,"June 11, 2016",130,Absolutely the best copd medicine i have ever taken. Why did i destroy my own lungs with cigarettes? Youth and stupidity I guess. went from a dying couch potato to a 5k runner with Symbicort. 2 puffs in the morning and 2 before bed keeps me in great shape.

31,Symbicort,COPD,10.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"September 11, 2014",106,I'm pretty sure that I would have died without it. I had already had full respiratory failure with extended hospital stay and hooked up to oxygen when I went home. Then once I got off of the oxygen I had emergency level exacerbations sometimes 3 or 4 times a week which increases your mortality rate. When I started using the Symbicort it went away.,deongg

It was very discouraging. The doctor then sent me Symbicort 80/4.5 the first day was a miracle. I can shovel snow, walk my dog 1/2 mile and have not touched the rescue once. Not sure of any side effects yet as it has been only a week but the BEST week in a long time. I would recommend this to anyone who can use it.",Mrzeee

After a few weeks I noticed that my breathing got worse. Symbicort has made a huge difference in me being able to breath and not.

I did not swallow it. I have had the 5 pills to suck on every day for 14 days and now the Nystatin to swish, gargle and swallow. I am much better now, but I took myself off the Symbicort. I am also on a lot of other medicines but the one I absolutely need is phenytoin, due to a brain aneurysm.
