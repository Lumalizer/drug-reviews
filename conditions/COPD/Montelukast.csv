0,Montelukast,COPD,10,Taken for 10 years or more,"December 13, 2021",0,I have been on montelukast 10mg for very long now. It has improved my quality of life combined with a few other meds such as Sereflo pump and Theophylline 300mg. I take mine at night as that is when I experience issues breathing. I have found that I can under no circumstances leave the montelukast as I get SEVERE chest pains if I am an hour or few minutes late with taking my pill. The pains are EXTREMELY unbearable & I cannot take it. I have come off the medication before & know that it is seasonal but this pain is  stopping me from leaving the medication. No doctor can tell me what or why the pains are but I will tell you it feels as if I can rip my chest open. I feel the pain in my lungs from the front at the back of my rib cage. It is terrible. I feel this medication has made me stay on it & nothing in the leaflet says anything of the sort of experience I have been having for years if I am slightly later than 24 hours use.,RoxyVR

One night when in the hospital, boom!  It hit me and I was even on oxygen.  Well, since taking montelukast, even as the generic of Singular (as some may agree, generics often don't have the same effect as brand names), I have had no night time problems.",Sir Tin
