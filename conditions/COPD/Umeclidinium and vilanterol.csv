I thought it was a miracle drug at first, easier breathing, didn't need rescue inhaler for months. 7 mos into using it my legs started hurting so bad, had xrays for blood clots, had more xrays, they seen mild osteoarthritis. Still in pain, went to chiropractor to get relief, none. I also developed a terrible cough in the last few months,  I decided to check out this site, and I am convinced it is the Anoro.

I tried Trelegy, same ingredients w/added steroid. The same damn leg and hip pain. Dr says I’ve never heard that before. They need to listen when people tell them this med is causing joint pains.

But after 2 months I couldn’t sleep and had severe heartburn and a huge floater in my right eye. The druggist told me none of these side affects could be caused by Anora but that was the only drug I was taking. My doctor said I should cut back to a schedule I was comfortable with so I started taking it once a week. The day I take it I get immediate heartburn and it interrupts  my sleep.  These side effects last for 3 days which is about as long as one dose will keep me breathing freely.  After 3 days I have to rely on my ventolin.,Pattio74

Initially it was a relieve not having to take the drug twice a day but the side effects are really bad for me. An hour after taking Anoro I get a decent headache which lasts till mid afternoon. Anoro also gives me constipation and shortness of breath (unless my COPD got worse and causes it) and walks of an hour are a thing of the past.,Far Away

The down side is I started having leg pain and cramps and pelvis and crouch pain; very uncomfortable.  I don't know what is going on but I'm researching.  I am also tired all the time.

Each time I took it for a few months and I had severe leg pain. I would stop and the pain would be gone in 2 -3 days. Then the doctor and pharmacist would tell me I was wrong that Anoro didn't cause muscle pain. The pain became so terrible that I could not walk more than 7 - 10 steps at a time. I stopped it for good and relied on rescue inhalers for when I struggled for breathe. Two and one-half years ago I switched to Trelegy. I like it very, very much. The 1 1/2 years ago, I was diagnosed with axonal polyneuropathy. Then the doctor for a renown institution wondered if the beta agonist had caused the neuropathy. Unfortunate, as I now have a life long degenerative disease that MAY have been caused by Anoro and beta agonist.",Jef

After a week on it I couldn't breath worth a hoot so I switched back to Anora.

I could actually do some housework without huffing and puffing. But I started having these excruciating leg pains. I didn't correlate them to the inhaler as they didn't start right away and I thought it was an odd side effect. But I continued to have them. I also have fibromyalgia. But I had never had leg aches and pains like this. My upper thighs were so painful always aching and throbbing. I would take ibuprofen daily and at night and take flexeril and klonopin at night to help me sleep along with placing a heating pad on my thighs. They are still hurting. I went off a lot of my meds trying to figure out which one it could be. But not until I went a few days without the anoro because we lost our insurance did my leg pain get better.I haven't started any other medicine back for my COPD,Newcopddx
