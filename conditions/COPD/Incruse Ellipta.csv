0,Incruse Ellipta,COPD,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"March 6, 2022",0,"First couple days was excellent then all the sudden I couldn’t breathe good using my rescue inhaler 3-4 times a day, non stop coughing, lots of wheezing, anxiety. Seen my Dr he switched me to Breo but I’m scared of trying it after reading the reviews on that. Since getting COVID 7 months ago I’ve been on many different inhalers for the first time in my life for my lungs and none seem to work .",Jme
1,Incruse Ellipta,COPD,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"August 6, 2021",1,"I've never felt so ill in all my life, I've gone from working to being stuck in my flat, can't sleep, mucus that I never had before, breathing 10 times worse. I feel like I'm being tortured and nobody is listening. Had paramedic here the first time I used it because I couldn't breathe and two weeks later no change.",Gail
2,Incruse Ellipta,COPD,1.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"July 29, 2021",0,I would not recommend Incruse inhaler to anyone. It has given me  heart blockage. I am very angry as it is not listed as a side affect.,Tt
3,Incruse Ellipta,COPD,10.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"June 29, 2020",23,"I haven't had an exacerbation since I began using Incruse Ellipta and my breathing has improved 100%.  I've had no side effects, reactions, or adverse events.",WildcatVet
4,Incruse Ellipta,COPD,5.0,,"February 15, 2020",33,"Incruse helped me breathe more than any other inhaler.   But a couple of weeks after being on it, some food caught  in my throat and (terrifyingly!)  I coughed up blood. I hoped it was  a one- off thing. But it happened again necessitating  an endoscopy and then an examination from an ENT. Tests revealed nothing . It’s happened now six times. Then a couple of months ago  the right side of my face went numb and swollen. Then I noticed white sores in my mouth and on my lips. Thrush.  The doctor gave me antifungal drops that made it go and but  it returned with a vengeance. It was a nightmare!  I subsequently was prescribed a stronger antifungal  - two lots - but it’s all returned. I always rinse my mouth thoroughly.  I also gargle in salt and sterilize my toothbrushes. The next step is an even stronger  antifungal  that requires frequent liver tests -  not ideal for someone with a lung/ liver disease like me. I feel like I’m living a nightmare in my quest to breathe.",Hope
5,Incruse Ellipta,COPD,,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"December 21, 2019",21,"Horrible muscle and joint pain, severe anxiety interfering even with my ability to do job interviews, severe stomach pain which took me to ER =gastritis. Do now I have a choice - use Incruse with my Breo so I can breath and work along with medications to counteract side effects example :atenolol for blood pressure and anxiety control, and tylenlol#3 for severe pain levels and muscle tightness, as well as pepcid AC 20mg twice daily and carafate between the pepcid for severe abdominal pain..or I can just quit Incruse and stay home sit in a chair  not being able to breath.",BJ

7,Incruse Ellipta,COPD,7.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"February 15, 2019",27,"I was switched from Spiriva to Incruse after eight months of sore throat, dry cough, and generally feeling bad following surgery to replace aortic heart valve. I just had my yearly eye exam and have been referred to specialist for evaluation of wide angle glaucoma. These findings were not seen one year ago. This is listed on the drug insert as a possible side effect of   Incruse. I likely will be taken off of Incruse.",Garbo

10,Incruse Ellipta,COPD,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"July 16, 2018",39,"I was forced to switch from Spiriva capsule to spiriva Respimat that I was doing very well on, with few side effects.  Spiriva Respimat caused severe dizziness, anxiety and breathing problems.   Then I was forced to try Incruse Ellipta and this one is even worse.

12,Incruse Ellipta,COPD,2.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"May 1, 2018",30,"I switched to this last week, from spiriva, due to a difference of $35, on my copay. I dislike it very much. I have had a sore throat since starting. I came down with a cold immediately.  I get a horrible taste, and a burning sensation in my throat, when I take it, and gargling does not help my throat. The burning is still there. I expect to get thrush, and will be very unhappy.",diane
13,Incruse Ellipta,COPD,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"April 19, 2018",31,"I have been on this drug for two weeks and feel downright awful. I need to use my oxygen all the time, can barely walk to the kitchen from the living room without getting extremely weak, and constantly feel like I need to clear my throat.

16,Incruse Ellipta,COPD,2.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"July 1, 2016",47,"I began using Incruse Ellipta after my Medicare Advantage plan discontinued coverage for Spiriva, which I had used successfully for a couple of years. The biggest problem I encountered was the horrid, bitter taste of the Incruse. At first I thought perhaps I had received an outdated inhaler, but my first refill had the same awful taste. I developed thrush and had to be treated for that. After six weeks on the Incruse Ellipta, I and my Immunologist applied for and were granted an exception for me to return to using Spiriva.",Lunadia

18,Incruse Ellipta,COPD,3.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"May 2, 2016",61,My Medicare Advantage Company suggested I use this after they removed Spriva from their approved list on medications.  I used it for a week and my emphysema worsened considerably.  It worsened to the point that I couldn't walk 10 yards without stopping to get my breath.  I called my pulmonary doctor to see if I could get an exception made to go back on Spirva.,tmf24556
