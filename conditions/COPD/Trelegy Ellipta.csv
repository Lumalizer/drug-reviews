1,Trelegy Ellipta,COPD,3.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"March 19, 2022",0,I was given Trelegy by my doctor for my COPD. I had a bad breathing episode the other night so I used Trelegy several times. This was probably a mistake. I have been off of it for about 4 days but the side effects have been awful. I have very bad back pain and can hardly stand up straight. I am waiting for the meds to get out of my system. I am in a great deal of pain and using ice packs as well as heat. Everything is an effort to do. I will never take this drug again though it cost me a lot of money. Ventolin and advise are better.,Jilly

So I I've got to stop taking it again. I know there is a God that will help me. Good luck everyone.",Brenda Starling

4,Trelegy Ellipta,COPD,,,"December 9, 2021",0,My pulmonologist gave me samples of Trelegy to see if I’d do better. I have been on their website & requested information on their free requirements. Response has been silence. Not once have they reached out to provide information. Shows that the profit margin is their preferred mode of operation.,Tina
5,Trelegy Ellipta,COPD,2.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"December 4, 2021",0,"I have COPD and have been on every inhaler on the market. None of them give me enough relief to be able to carry out daily activities. The problem I find with all of the dry powdered inhalers is that most of the powder ends up in the back of my throat. I don't know what I'm doing wrong, or if anyone else has this problem, but it means that the medication is not getting into my lungs. I may have side effects from Trelegy, it's hard to sell since I have some side effects from all of them.",Barb

8,Trelegy Ellipta,COPD,5.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"November 19, 2021",1,"Works absolutely great for my mild COPD maintenance.  I found I could use it every other day.  However, the pulmonologist is switching me, saying I don't need the steroid. The anti-cholinergic (umeclidinium) started creating a constipation problem, but this was expected and fixed with OTC stool softener (ducusate Na).  I got a bad cramp in my calf at 5 AM one night, so this was unexpectedly LOWERING MY POTASSIUM.  Watch out for that one. Ridiculously expensive!

They all have some side effects, but this last year I noticed my teeth falling apart. The teeth would come apart, by separating at the gum line and leaving small part of the tooth sticking up. I stopped using it about 2 months ago when I figured it was the trelegy doing the damage. I need all new teeth which will cost way more than I can afford.",D Duke

I went back to this med and along with a handful of other meds it's kept me out of the hospital (exacerbations). Keep your mouth washed out after using inhaled steroids and all should be good.

33,Trelegy Ellipta,COPD,10.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"October 29, 2020",72,"I had used Advair and Spiriva for many years and my COPD was slowly getting worse and worse. My doctor put me on oxygen.  The bathroom is only a few feet from my bed, and I couldn't make it in there without my oxygen on.  Every 3 months or so, I would have to go to the E.R. for a breathing treatment and steroids.  About 2 years ago, he told me to use Trelegy instead.  I recently noticed that I wasn't using my oxygen while in my room.  And I wasn't needing the oxygen to go to the bathroom.  And I was walking all over the house without my oxygen on.  I haven't been to the E.R. in over 2 years now.  I know that there isn't a cure for COPD, but I honestly think that Trelegy has stopped the progression. Trelegy costs me $3.60 a month.  I am on Standard Medicare and Obamacare.",Knoman

62,Trelegy Ellipta,COPD,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"October 20, 2019",51,Trelegy is absolutely amazing!  From day one I have such great improvement in my breathing. The problems I had are reduced so much. I hardly use my inhaler. Wheezing and mucus are barely there. Shortness of breath is greatly reduced. Sleeping is so much better too. I am very happy with Trelegy.,MSmith6747

I find the results to be confusing. I now don't feel like I'm getting out of breath and I'm not having to use my Pro-air inhaler much all. However my 02 stats have taken a nose dive. They were running between 93 to 96 and at times would hit 97 for a very short period of time, Since using Trelegy they have dropped as low as 86 and are usually between 90 to 93. I don't understand this and I will probably follow up with my doctor.",Ron

Re: side effects, I haven't noticed any, although I am 77 and live with chronic pain and other problems which make it difficult sometimes to know what is causing what, if that makes sense. It has given me a more positive outlook about the COPD now that I'm using oxygen less and my breathing is much better.",Nan

A month ago I switched to Trelegy Ellipta, which I gather combines Relvar and Incruse. Since switching from Spiriva I have suffered far fewer flare-ups (two a year on average rather than eight or nine) and the Trelegy Ellipta has made no difference so I’m happy to keep on using it. So far I have suffered no side-effects at all.",Mike

Then after the first of the year my insurance changed and the cost went to over $700.00. My dr talked to insurance co and it went to $260.00 for 30 day supply.  I couldn't afford that so my dr put me on another med and side effects about killed me. Then dr gave me sample of trelegy see if he can find something else for me.,kenman

86,Trelegy Ellipta,COPD,,Taken for less than 1 month,"January 4, 2019",16,I am relatively new to meds for COPD - and am also finding the costs are ridiculously high. I have been appealing to my insurance company- I called customer service-and they helped me get the forms for the doctor to appeal but have no results yet- but it's worth 'trying' at least. Maybe some of the others on here can try appeal or ask for special consideration as well - Good luck to us all,darby

Advair did not help also advair made my tongue so sore I could hardly eat. I rinse after using Trelegy but I think only side effect seems to be back towards my throat is a little sore. It hasn't been expensive, so far anyway. I have bought 1 inhaler. But I'm on medicare.  8 dollars for an inhaler that helps isn't bad! That's been my experience so far",Tigger
88,Trelegy Ellipta,COPD,,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"December 20, 2018",33,"I initially coughed for the first hour, then the following day, half of my head hurt to the touch, it felt like it was sunburned. That lasted a week. Then I had increased mucus , that woke me up at night, as I was chocking on it. I had pains in my hips and joints, and the pain moved down my legs as I lifted them to lay on a couch, I could no longer lift my arms above my head, without them being in pain at the muscle, which felt as if it went down to the bone. A sore throat and headaches.Other than those side effects my breathing did improve, but not enough to warrant putting up with the side effects. I lasted 3 months, then gave it up. Doctor then tried me on Trimbow, that lasted 3 days, when I ended up with vertigo. I'm now back on seebri & fostair",stoly

I was using a Ventolin inhaler every four hours, night and day, for approximately 3 months. I was given the Trelegy Ellipta three weeks ago. The transformation in my breathing and overall health has been remarkable. I can only hope that the benefits persist, and any side effects (I have high blood pressure and type 2 diabetes) are minimal. The only reason I rated a 9 rather than a 10 is due to worries with side effects.",Zimmerman
90,Trelegy Ellipta,COPD,4.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"October 26, 2018",39,I wanted to try Trelegy  Ellipta after 2 years of Anoro.   I got a 4 week sample from my Doctor. My first few days of using I felt I had better breathing but after 3 weeks of use it lost its effectiveness.  The biggest problem I have had with this inhaler is nearly constant  moderate hoarseness and laryngitis. I can't take it anymore because my job requires speaking. I thought it would be a temporary side effect but now I will return to the Anoro. Very disappointed.,mill

The doctor gave me a sample in within two days I can breathe 100% better. Didn’t get winded walking or climbing stairs. A fantastic drug.
