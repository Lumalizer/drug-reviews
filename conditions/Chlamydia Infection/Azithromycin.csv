0,Azithromycin,Chlamydia Infection,1.0,,"February 19, 2022",0,First of all everyone’s body is different and will react different. So don’t leave a review saying it’ll be fine because for most it’s not fine. This pill made me feel like I was having contractions! I was in the fetal position for two hours crying. I ate before I took the pills yet I still had the worse cramps I’ve ever had.,Lola
1,Azithromycin,Chlamydia Infection,9.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"February 6, 2022",1,"if you’re reading these, you’re probably just as scared as I was to take these pills. I got four 250mg pills and was instructed to take them all together. So I ate a bagel around 5:45pm and took all 4 at around 7pm. After that I ate a piece of banana bread and felt fine. At around 9pm I started to get really hot and a little nauseous, but nothing unbearable. My stomach started rumbling but honestly it was nothing horrible. I then went to bed at 9:30pm, woke up once around 11pm and was a little hot but then went back to bed at midnight and slept through the night fine. So long story short, I worked myself up for 4 days, expecting the worst and it was honestly not bad at all. I’m just glad it’ll get rid of this infection! So if you’re reading this, TAKE THEM!! It’s not that bad I promise! As long as you eat a little bit before and a little bit after you will be FINE! I promise!",healthanxiety
2,Azithromycin,Chlamydia Infection,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"December 24, 2021",0,"So I got prescribed two 500mg tablets to take in order to treat chlamydia. I read reviews and worst case scenario situations and drove myself insane to the point where I put off taking the antibiotics for two weeks because I was worried about getting violently sick/debilitating stomach pains.On one sunny morning I decided enough was enough and took both pills in the same dose with bread. I did feel nauseated for like half an hour and had two bouts of semi looser than normal stools, ate more food, then felt almost immediately better after, I didn't even need to take my probiotics I ordered. Definitely don't eat this on an empty stomach, if I actually ate food prior to taking this I probably wouldn't have had as much stomach upset as I did. I never got a stomach ache or cramps. I'm now on day three and haven't had any other symptoms other than being slightly gassier than normal.",Anonymous
3,Azithromycin,Chlamydia Infection,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"September 6, 2021",0,"I was scared because I have the worse experience with antibiotics but this one was probably the best. No chalky taste. Easy to take. Take with food to avoid stomach aches! I had noodles & a smoothie & was perfectly fine. And remember to practice safe sex, just because your only have sex with one person doesn’t mean your partner is",Anonymous
4,Azithromycin,Chlamydia Infection,8.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"July 10, 2021",1,I took the azithromycin 500mg 2 dose yesterday. I instantly felt nauseous and sick within the first hour and then got diarrhea within the second hour. I also was extremely dizzy and had a dry mouth for the rest of the day. Definitely not fun but worth it to cure what I have.,NY
5,Azithromycin,Chlamydia Infection,9.0,,"July 9, 2021",2,"Wow I just took this yesterday July 8, 2021 And I took a 1000 Mg dose and then ate a bag of chips afterwards. About an hour later, I had really really bad stomach cramps!! almost like contractions and I experienced diarrhea and the shakes for about 30 maybe 40 minutes. After that, I dozed off and went to sleep. Woke up, and the stomach pains had minored. THANK GOODNESS!! Drinking pickle juice helps cramps also.",silly_face
6,Azithromycin,Chlamydia Infection,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"June 22, 2021",46,If your reading this then your probably terrified just like I was when I got this medicine. I've had it for a week before I finally decided to take it. I had worked myself up over this medicine so bad I was barely eating anything. So yesterday I finally decided to take it. I had a small meal at dinner time then waited a couple hours and ate 4 pieces of bread then took the two 500mg pills and absolutely nothing happened. I'm so upset at myself for waiting this long. So if you have severe anxiety plus have a phobia of getting sick DON'T BE SCARED. IF I CAN DO IT ANYONE CAN. You got this!,Sweettea1229
7,Azithromycin,Chlamydia Infection,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"May 24, 2021",2,"at first the gynecologist thought I just had BV. So I was put on Flagyl and she did  a swab as well. 2 days later I get a call saying I was positive for BV and Chlamydia. I was put on Azithromycin. I took the 2 tablets as soon as I got home. I had a chicken sandwich with it and that’s it. 3 hours later that I had nausea. About a 6/10 on the bad scale Then about 30 minutes after that I had massive stomach pains. I had my hand on my lower stomach and it was sharp on off pain. I could feel myself having extreme amounts of discharge but everything went away within 1 hour.The next morning I had dark green stool, but no problem pooing. And a teaspoon amount of light green discharge in my undies, which I changed RIGHT before bed to so I could what happen overnight.No discharge AT all on day 5 of starting antibiotics, and 3 days since taking Azithromycin. And no more side effects. Odor is COMPLETELY goneI have no insurance and this costed me $9.67 after tax",Bunniesbuns
8,Azithromycin,Chlamydia Infection,9.0,,"May 5, 2021",4,"I got it for the second time AGAIN. I took the pills 1000mg back in December 2020. I had eaten an hour prior and I took it when I got home. I was having little cramps so I decided to get in hot water bathtub. I started being nauseous AND THROWING UP. It was awful. My stomach was in pain. I came and laid down in fetus position in pain crying. Keep losing consciousness. I almost went to ER. I took it around 7pm & it lasted till 3am.  I was so scared to take it again. BUT THIS TIME I WENT ATE SOME Shrimp PHO, then some bread, came home and pop the pills WITH whole bottle of water so it don’t affect much of my stomach lining. I did feel cramps like for 2 seconds but as soon as I felt that I ate some probiotic yoghurt and it helped the cramps completely. I was so happy there wasn't a drama. If you are taking this please make sure your stomach isn't empty, else your lining will burn.  Eat a lot and take it with a bottle of water and probiotic yogurt drink helps so much more",Broski
9,Azithromycin,Chlamydia Infection,9.0,,"April 16, 2021",2,"Hi everyone. I found out today I tested positive for Chlamydia after going to the gyno to get everything tested once I started practicing UNSAFE sex. Over the course of the past three months I have been a bit busy!  In my case I have no idea how I got it nor who I could’ve given it to. Anyway, I took the medicine about three hours ago, ate a huge dinner with lots of carbs, red meat, all that. I left dinner around an hour ago thinking I had to poop, I couldn’t. Now, a half hour later I am literally on the toilet spilling my guts out into the toilet. Although I think this is bad, my gyno said it would happen and I haven’t felt nauseous yet. YET. Overall, I hope it will help my STD and definitely taught me to have safe sex and with one partner for now on. I even got a dose for my partner.  PRACTICE SAFE SEX!!",d
10,Azithromycin,Chlamydia Infection,2.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"April 12, 2021",3,"Worse medication I ever took, I read these reviews and most said not to be too worried, it wasn’t that bad. I took two 500mg pills for one day after I ate a good meal, I got drowsy and fell asleep then woke up to one of the worse stomach pains I ever felt and was trying not to vomit, I then had to go home, on my way home I pooped on myself and I pulled over on the side of the highway and pooped on the side of the highway, I made it home and now I am very nauseous",Ash
11,Azithromycin,Chlamydia Infection,5.0,,"April 8, 2021",1,"Took two 500 mg azithromycin about 9 days ago. I only got a slight upset stomach and diarrhea, nothing too bad. The one thing is I am still experiencing chlamydia symptoms. Now I am just really itchy. All my other symptoms are gone, I read some people said it took 10 days for it to work to cure all symptoms. I've gotten chlaymdia before but I forgot the medication I took for it the first time but my symptoms cleared up right away last time. Hoping this works.",Anyonmous
12,Azithromycin,Chlamydia Infection,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"April 3, 2021",2,"I’m back again to share something interesting.Roughly a week after taking the 1g dose, I started having multiple anxiety attacks unlike anything I’ve ever had before, including some constant brain fog, and a feeling of disconnect. Long Story short, your gut is your second brain, and most of the serotonin receptors are in the gut.This drug gets rid of the good and bad bacteria in your gut which CAN effect mental health. While my reason for taking the drug was sound, maybe try something else if you for sure have anxiety, otherwise, probiotics and CBD. I’ve been eating yogurt, taking probiotic capsules (Whole Foods sells them) eating healthier, sleeping more, exercising, and my anxiety is under better control, but it’s still there...for now. It’s been said that these feelings can last a month for the unlucky, so take good care of yourself.",Northman
13,Azithromycin,Chlamydia Infection,9.0,,"March 29, 2021",3,"Please Read!! It’s gonna be ok! I took the 2 Tablet of 500MG each after I ate a frozen pizza and downed a ton of water, I should have eaten toast....BUT! My stomach pain and nausea only lasted a couple hours! For the first 30-45 min I felt fine and started to crimp my hair as I do when I’m bored. Half way throu, I felt like I was going to hurl. I sat on the toilet with a towel In my lap for about 15 min just breathing trying not to throw up, but I was tempted. My DR told me I’d have to retake the meds if I threw up within a 8-12 hour period so I decided That is so not going to happen, I’m gonna pull through this I curled up in my bed in a fetal position, this is about 1 hour and 15 min in to taking the meds For about 15 min I laid there and my tummy was growling and I felt gas bubbles and I actually farted a lot. But by the 2 hour mark I was back to feeling absolutely normalCrossing my fingers it works but just drink water and remember to breathe",Crayola
14,Azithromycin,Chlamydia Infection,7.0,,"March 18, 2021",6,"The largest inconvenience about this drug for me was trying to read everyone else’s negative review before I took the 1 gram dose and I had anxiety about it for HOURS before I realized taking this will do good. The only side effects I had from this drug was some watery stools and some intestinal noise.  Whoever is reading this, you’re probably scared as to take it because you never have and wanted to know. Unless you have heart problems or other medication known to react with this:It is safe to take and for the love of Odin take it with (a lot of) food and water. Friends of mine once had to take it too, and they said they felt no different. You will be alright.You may experience stomach issues and nausea for a little bit, but all in all, you will survive. You got this! I gave the medication a 7 because, again, anxiety over all of the horror stories.",Northman

I was so afraid of feeling sick but I ate a piece of toast and 2 slices of turkey bacon. About 30 minutes later I took both of the pills ( 500mg x 2) with some water and I am perfectly fine.

But!I decided to get rid of this ASAP because I don’t wanna be stuck with this .

Annoying but tolerable ? * it’s only been 12 hours since medication * WILL UPDATE EVERY DAYTips:- I took a nausea pill 30 mins before taking this medication - I prepared my stomach 2 days before by taking probiotics and eating healthy ! - Eat small meals!

18,Azithromycin,Chlamydia Infection,2.0,,"March 5, 2021",0,"I picked up the prescription, came home and took it. I didn’t do research and regretted it!! I hadn’t eaten during the day and took it about an hour before I ate dinner. I was super hungry but when I sat down to eat I couldn’t stomach my food. I started feeling really sick, going pale, had some heat flashes, and could not hold a conversation. Immediately ran to the bathroom and had really bad cramps and diarrhea:( Luckily only had to make 3 trips to the bathroom and ended up laying in bed in a fetal position hoping I would feel better. That's when I did some research and ended up talking myself to not throw up the pills so I wouldn’t have to take them again. I felt a lot better about 3 hours after taking the medication and ended up going to bed ASAP. I felt fine next day and made a couple trips to the bathroom resulting from the medication. Not the best experience, thought I was gonna pass out but I’m glad I only had to take them once (2 pills 1000mg dosage) Please be safe :)",Anonymous

Trust me on that and stay safe guys , I know the comment might be scary but all those comments help me because I see I wasn’t the only one suffering from the same side effects.

I found out and got tested...cue the chlamydia. My doctor gave me two Azithromycin pills. I ate a light meal and took them. I also took a Zofran an hour before as a precaution. The zofran didn't help. I was crying on the floor to my mom and writhing in pain. The worst stomach pains I've EVER had. I was nauseous for about 2 hours fighting the urge to throw up, because I didn't want to take them again. Stomach made the most horrendous noises. Luckily it's subsided, I took a warm shower and now I'm in bed contemplating all life decision that led up to that moment.

It was on an empty stomach in the morning and I instantly threw it up and it hurt my throat. So I asked my doctor for another prescription this time it’s been a week and I haven’t taken it. Tonight I’m going to take it because I ate enough and I’m pregnant so I really scared with having a STD and being pregnant. Hopefully I don’t get stomach pains or anything else.

25,Azithromycin,Chlamydia Infection,3.0,,"February 2, 2021",0,Side effects from azithromycin was that I had horrible cramping & nausea. I couldn’t move without thinking I’d throw up.

My boyfriend had gotten tested 2 weeks before we had intercourse and I got tested right after him and came up with nothing, he didn’t have any symptoms of it and I didn’t either, I only had BV and I don’t know maybe that made me prone to get chlamydia, but let me get to the point with my anxiety and phobia of pills it took me 3-4 days to drink the pills because I was scared of taking the 4 pills (1000mg) all together. And reading these reviews of how people reacted made me anxious but me I reacted fine for now as I’m writing this sitting on the toilet yes it does give you some stomach aches here and there they were strong at first until I fell asleep around 1AM and it made me feel very gassy and nauseous I hate it.

27,Azithromycin,Chlamydia Infection,4.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"January 16, 2021",3,Honestly... I wish someone would have told me what I was getting myself into with taking this. And also I do understand everyone’s reaction is different but I just wish I could’ve prepared myself. I had the WORST stomach cramps and stomach pain I’ve ever had in my life! Similar to a previous food poisoning experience...I took gravol before since my doctor said it could cause some nausea but this was beyond anything I’d ever imagined.  Shortly after the cramping started I had UNCONTROLLABLE diarrhea! I feel so lucky I wasn’t driving or working.  It lasted several hours and I even woke up in the middle of the night to more cramps and..... you know what... It’s the next day and I’m still having cramps and stomach gurgles.  Ugh.

29,Azithromycin,Chlamydia Infection,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"January 12, 2021",10,"OK so I have horrible anxiety and after reading these reviews I WAS TERRIFIED . I waited 3 days to take my azithromycin pills then last night I finally took them while shaking . I was given four 250mg tablets so I took 2 with some water and took the other 2 a hour later (I didn't feel comfortable taking all 4 at once) the first 2 gave me mild cramps and stomach bubbles , then when I took the last 2 I was going to sleep (because I was still terrified). I also took a 800 mg ibuprofen after reading about the stomach pains so that maybe help. But for the most part I only experienced mild cramps, gassy and I did have sweats for a good 5 mins. Woke up and I just felt like my stomach was empty . So again don't let these reviews scare you. Take before bed and it'll be much better. Stay safe .",Just a Friend

I wonder how I will feel when I start taking my prescription...YIKES! I can’t give this drug a solid rate yet because it’s too soon to tell if it’s effective or how long/if side effects go away.

My stomach has rumbled a little but that could be because I am hungry. No pain, nothing! Hopefully it stays this way. I’d recommend eating a small meal a few hours before then have some crackers.

My stomach did make some funky noises within the first couple of hours, as well as feeling sick, but I never had to vomit, and I never got any headaches. I did feel weird and smellier than usual during the first 2-3 days, but by day 5, I felt like myself again! I also had BV alongside the STI, and I noticed this cleared up my BV as well. The odors I had were completely gone, no more runny discharge, I felt energized again, no more abnormalities by day 6. This was a great antibiotic, and I am so glad it exists because it was quick and effective.

I immediately layed down on my couch and on my side too. I did feel like I was getting a headache and felt sleepy but stayed laying down for about 2 hrs. I felt fine. I did NOT FEEL any cramps, or stomach pains at all! Lying down and resting is the trick. After about 2 hrs I did have some diarrhea but it wasn’t bad at all!

A year ago, I had a different bacterial infection that I was treated for by a different medication. I had a severe reaction to it and spent the night in the emergency room. Ever since that day, I have been terrified to take new types of medication, especially ones for bacterial infections. My doctor prescribed me this medication and after reading the reviews I was terrified. I postponed taking it for 3 days because I was scared. Then  I ate some toast and ginger tea right before I took it. DO NOT BE SCARED OF THIS MEDICATION. I had minimal side effects and was fine. All I had was some slight loose stools. The hardest part about taking this medication was controlling the anxiety. Everyone is different and tolerates medication differently. The reviews on here that are horror stories are rare.

I'm a total hypochondriac and was crying thinking about taking this pill after reading these reviews since I have IBS and a sensitive stomach. Took it with food waited an hour after eating to take it and was fine. Eat lots of activia yogurt, crackers,and Take FLORASTOR probiotic 4 times a day while taking this and you won't get pain or diarrhea. Its a probiotic made especially for antiboitic associated diarrhea.",besafenotsorry

140,Azithromycin,Chlamydia Infection,8.0,,"January 28, 2019",2,"*this is a positive review*I took the 1g powder version as directed at 10:30 am after eating a simple breakfast of oatmeal. I experienced:1. Slightly weird taste in mouth right after taking (went away after about 15 mins)2. Gurgling stomach, on and off, with one slightly watery stool- I wouldn’t have thought twice about it if I wasn’t watching for it. 3. Slightly acidic stomach which felt like it does when I’m hungry. For this I ate small simple foods throughout the day. 4. Sleepy! But manageable.Try to relax, and take this on a day when you don’t have much to do if you’re feeling anxious about it. My recommendation would be to find low key but stimulating activity, treat yourself well, and avoid coffee or other foods that may be agitating to the stomach. I will retest for chlamydia next week or so but wanted to leave this review now because I know a lot of the concern is re: side effects (I feel you on the side effect anxiety!)",Relax!

About 45 minutes after is when I took the pills. One dose of four of the 250g capsules. I didn’t feel any side effects until about 2 hours later. My stomach has been cramping and I feel very nauseous, but nothing too severe. My opinion is to eat relatively heavy before taking the pills and not just the two saltine crackers some offices offer. If the clinic suggests you to take them in the office and you haven’t ate, request to take the pills with you so you’re more prepared. Do not eat these on an empty stomach. My other suggestion is to do this on a day you don’t have much planned. I took the pills then came home and napped. I did wake up once feeling bad, but I fell back asleep and feel better now.

I ate some  chicken fettuccine pasta and then I took four 250mg tablets at once. I ate some plain salted chips afterwards and waited. The worst I had was a bit of stomach pain, which felt like I was really hungry but also the slightest bit nauseous. Make sure you eat before and after taking these meds! It gives the medicine something to mess with and not your stomach! Best of luck to anyone who has to take this, you’ll be just fine :)",Sj1282

Gave me 4 pills and a very painful muscle spasming shot in the left butt cheek. About 5 hours later with the pain subsiding and the discharge almost completely stopping thank goodness, I had extremely watery diarrhea, and strong bloating in my stomach. It eventually went away later that evening and I thought I was A OKAY!! Fast forward into the next day at 9 am, I have a really high fever and more  diarrhea. This fever came out of no where! I even researched if that could possibly be a side effect, I found nooooo evidence whatsoever still. I even called the damn clinic and the woman didn't understand and couldn’t help me at all about why I had a fever. Now I’m missing work and wasting a day in bed scared that this is very bad and not the norm. If anyone had any story of having a fever after please share!",John mayer
185,Azithromycin,Chlamydia Infection,6.0,,"July 27, 2018",2,"Doctor prescribed it, I went and picked it up the same day. I will say, most important thing about taking this drug is that 1, you are at home and can be alone in bed or in the bathroom, if needed. 2, That you DO absolutely take this on a full stomach considering it will be eradicating the bacteria from your stomach. Super bland meal is good. The first hour was fine. I fell asleep and woke up with extremely intense stomach cramps and nausea. They came in waves. I fell back asleep again. It’s been 7 hours now and I’m feeling okay. A little weak but no pain in the stomach anymore. Still haven’t had to use the restroom so that’s relieving. Although I said to eat food with this I don’t think there is really any way around the abdominal pain, especially if you have a sensitive stomach. Night time would probably be the most convenient time to do it. I hope this helped some individuals out.

I'm 9 weeks pregnant, almost 10 weeks and you can imagine my feeling from getting an STI from the father of my child. Well, I read this and was extremely scared. The reason I think everyone is throwing up is because of the food you're eating before you take this. Anything spicy or greasy is going to HURT your digestive system, honest. Eat a full meal but bland. I ate 2 bowls of macaroni and cheese made with water, cheese and butter. I drank one bottle of water, let it digest for 20 minutes. I took the medicine, afterwards ate crackers and had ginge rale. My best advice, just go to sleep after taking this. Take this at home, before bed where you have nothing to do.  At about 3:45am (I took at 11:20pm because I had work that night) I got some stomach pains that just felt like intense gas pains, and moved around a bit.

197,Azithromycin,Chlamydia Infection,9.0,,"May 14, 2018",2,I must tell you I was absolutely terrified of taking this medication because of a bad experience I had with antibiotics last year.  I put off taking them for over a week but couldn't tolerate the symptoms any longer and took the medication. I'm really glad I did because it's not been as bad as I'd imagined it would be. I did take extra precautions though after reading these reviews. I took probiotics the week leading up to taking the antibiotics and made sure I ate an hour before taking them. Its also important to make sure your electrolytes are balanced especially potassium so I made sure I'd done that too. I took the tablets at 10am and its now 2.30pm and I've only had mild diarrhea and stomach gurgling. I'm hoping that it will carry on this way because I can handle that. Will see what the next few days bring. The anxiety about taking this medication has been horrendous but it's got to be done.

I woke up and ate a fairly large breakfast, took my pills with a large glass of water Saturday Morning at 9:15am.  I went and laid down on the couch waiting for my death sentence (as I thought). An hour had passed and I felt nothing! 2 hours had passed and I did have a B.M , and felt very sleepy, I took a nap and continued with my day. It's Monday afternoon, 3 days in and I still feel completely fine. No vomiting, no upset stomach, none of that. I believe I was lucky and this week of treatment will be a breeze. Its not the horror I  thought it would be .

She took the powder treatment that morning, just said it tasted nasty. 8 days later (this morning) I called and found out I too was positive, so I went in and was given four 250mg. Took all those at once, then went back to bed. Stomach feels a bit uncomfortable, making some interesting noises, and took a rowdy dump earlier, overall not bad, but I do have a cast-iron stomach.",Damnitguys

I took 4 white pills and was so nervous but had no side effects apart from a little diarrhoea about 7 hours later. However, my partner and I had sex with a condom before the 7 days you are supposed to wait were up (stupid I know) and it didn’t stay on 100% so instead of going back to the doctors, doing a test and waiting to see my doctor and get a prescription which would take about 2/3 weeks in all I decided to order some from a high-street pharmacy which was way more expensive but I picked them up in a few hours. (If you’re in the UK its about £8 at the doctors if you’re over 18, at a high-street pharmacy like superdrug its £27 ish) These are two blue pills and took them 9 hours ago, some mild stomach pains and gas but that might just have been nerves and no vomiting or diarrhoea so far. Make sure you eat before and drink water. Basically, don’t be afraid to take them because not everyone gets awful side effects and make sure you and your partner are up to date with checks before having sex!

I was diagnosed with chlamydia about a month ago and was in tears day in and day out because I was so worried that the chlamydia might have spread, considering I had no idea my cheating ex had given it to me a year prior. (Pathetic, I know) Well anyways, I was prescribed 4 pills, I took 2 pills at the same time for 2 days consecutively (1g or 1000mg in total to be exact) I had no side effects. The burning sensation while I urinated went away in two days. This antibiotic honestly was heaven sent. P.S, I went to the doctor today for my Test of Cure and I am completely infection free!

I got pretty bad stomach cramps and diarrhea consistently throughout the night.  By the next morning though everything had subsided and I was fine. Ate normally, felt no side effects.
