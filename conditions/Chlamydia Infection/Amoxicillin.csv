0,Amoxicillin,Chlamydia Infection,9,Taken for less than 1 month,"February 22, 2022",1,"I had read online that the US CDC recommends this as an alternative antibiotic for Chlymidia Infection. two 500mg every 8 hours or 3x day for 7 days. Yes, you will probably get some diarrhea like I did, but if you don't treat it the alternative is damage to reproductive system and women becoming infertile. So when you forgot to use protection and your partner gives you a gift, you need to take your medicine.",G-Money
