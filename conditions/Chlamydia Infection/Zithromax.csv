2,Zithromax,Chlamydia Infection,9.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"November 1, 2019",12,"I've seen a lot of reviews and they kind of freaked me out about the side effects. I fixed me a nice brunch, I ate, then took the pills and about an hour after taking the (4) 250 mg zithromax pills my stomach started churning and rumbling. I used the bathroom ONCE and that was pretty much it. No vomiting, no bad diarrea or sweating ect. I took the pills Wednesday so I'm 2 days in.",Sauce

Took my dose of Zithromax and called up the ladies I had sexual relations with since. They all had it, super clap.  Now I gotta buy them all flowers  and get them zithromax.

6,Zithromax,Chlamydia Infection,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"October 17, 2017",12,"Took this last week under the directions of my pharmacist. I ate a full dinner (burger and some veg) and waited 45 minutes to an hour before taking my 4 large pink pills. My pharmacist and my doctor both recommended staying away from dairy in the meal before I took the pills.Went to bed feeling a little nauseous but, that could have been nerves because of all the reviews on here. I slept through the night, totally fine. No diarrhea, no vomiting. Got my lab results back this morning and I'm in the clear.",STI Freeeee

First time ever having to deal with a sti.  Anyways, I'm allergic to ""cillins"" so I was prescribed two 500mg. Tablets of zithromax.  Took then right at my doctors around 3:30.  My stomach started churning around 6:30, no nausea or vomiting.  Come 8pm, It was like a waterfall out my poop hole.  Only one bout so far, but I'm sure there will be more.  Had some slight stomach pain but nothing unbearable.  Waiting to find out how my partners feeling lol!!!",Poop factory

Absolutely no pain or discomfort except pure bloating. Had a pub lunch and beer for lunch with no issues... 8 hrs after taking I'm now consuming a glass of wine as heading out for a birthday, bloating a lot worse and it has gone straight to my head but no dramas as yet... will try and keep of the shots tonight though!",nickY_nick
10,Zithromax,Chlamydia Infection,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"May 26, 2016",14,"Soooo, I get a call saying I need to get checked, and of course I'm all butt hurt because I've had like one fling in my whole life and of course it's the only guy I didn't use protection with. So I go in, I get tested. I get the results. It's chlyamidia. My doctor prescribes me the drink powder and honestly, taking the medicine was terrible because the powder doesn't desolve all the way so I had to keep refilling my glass. I gagged a lot so just be careful with it. I ate right after I took it and it took about 30 minutes for the stomach cramps to start in. They were pretty uncomfortable, but I didn't get diarrhea just the cramps. It's not great, but I mean. It's the price I pay. Just gonna sleep it off. And probably never have sex again.",BornAgainVirgin
11,Zithromax,Chlamydia Infection,7.0,,"December 14, 2015",10,"Was prescribed one dose over the course of one day, took 4 pills of 250mg after a light lunch, and had nausea and mild stomach pains/upset. Lying down did not alleviate the discomfort and threw up 3 hours later. Called up my doctor to check if I needed to take another dose but he said my body would have absorbed the pills by then. Still experiencing mild stomach pains but nausea is mostly gone now.",Mkayla16

(and didn't and never would) but I've only been sexual active with 3 other guys and I've ALWAYS used protection with them and the reason me and my current bf didn't use protection was because we didn't have any (dumb I know) but now I'm suffering so much pain in my stomach and I can hardly move and I'm terrified to tell my mum about it! God this better work",Lee Lee 6987
13,Zithromax,Chlamydia Infection,4.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"May 20, 2014",27,"Took the 4 capsules by mouth at once and within 40 minutes I am having CHRONIC stomach pain, EXTREME nausea and 2 trips within 15 minutes to the toilet with diarrhea. I rarely ever feel side effects to any medication I%u2019ve ever taken and this hurts like the dickens. I have yet to actually throw up but I am using all the power in me not to so I can make sure the medication stays in my system to cure the infection. If this does cure the infection like it should then it%u2019ll be worth it. This is the most miserable I%u2019ve ever felt, and if I throw up I hop, hop here comes bathroom trip number 3.",Anonymous
14,Zithromax,Chlamydia Infection,5.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"November 26, 2013",29,It doesn't taste like anything when I took it. But I eat a meal with it and drink a glass of water/milk like it suggests. I've taken this medication three times. Each time it makes my stomach hurt and I feel very nauseous. I also get sweaty and have bad diarrhea within in an hour or two. It clears the infection up well though.,NastyNastyE
