1,Levofloxacin,Chlamydia Infection,1,Taken for less than 1 month,"March 28, 2019",8,"I plead to you do not to take this medication unless it is your absolute final option! I'm 27 years old, after I took one 500mg pill within 3 hours all the joints in my hands started to feel like they were pulling apart, HORRIFYING! I couldn't walk normally and I felt like I was 100 years old. I stopped the medication and woke up to discover my vision was fading away into a blur intermittently sometimes in one eye sometimes the other like I wasn't wearing corrective lenses even though I was. I'll admit I prayed even though I'm not religious I was so sick from this medication and everything was so scary. My arms would fall asleep and get pins and needles, My ears would ring and ring.  Finally after more than 2 months things are mostly the back to normal, others haven't been so lucky, don't take this unless you're dying.",Username888
2,Levofloxacin,Chlamydia Infection,1,Taken for less than 1 month,"September 4, 2018",3,Taken levofloxacin 500g for a week for severe chlamydia infection. 2 months later I started feeling tingling pain on arms and legs. Later I started feeling numb on my left hand. The headache that does not go away bothers me the most. Luckily I do not feel severe pain as others do. The headache is annoying enough tho.,Kelly
