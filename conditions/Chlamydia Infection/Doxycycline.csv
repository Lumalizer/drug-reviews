0,Doxycycline,Chlamydia Infection,8.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"March 2, 2022",1,"Was prescribed this for an STI infection. I combed through all the reviews on here and was terrified it would be the worst thing in the world. Do not let these reviews scare you!! I am on day 4 and honestly my side effects have only been headaches which are very manageable. I failed to eat within an hour of taking dose 3 and that’s when I got nauseous….like super nauseous. Just make sure to take it with food and you will be totally fine. I was asymptomatic, so I have no reference on how fast it started working on clearing up symptoms. So far everything has been fine and minimal side effects. I will be retested at week 3 per drs orders to see if treatment was effective. Please do yourself a favor and don’t read all these worst case scenario reviews and scare yourself. Just follow instructions from your dr and make sure to eat right when you take the pills.",Anonymous
1,Doxycycline,Chlamydia Infection,9.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"January 13, 2022",1,"Got tested for std and came back positive will chlamydia. I was prescribed with 100mg to be taken twice daily for 7 days. It did take me a while to take them as I’m scared of vomit and didn’t want to feel sick. But I have to say since being on for the past 6 days I have had no sickness, no symptoms so far. I did feel a tiny bit nauseous on day 3 but that was because I took long to eat in the morning. Please guys don’t be scared to take them you’ll be fine just make sure you eat. (Hopefully this clears it up)",Shani-heart

I didn’t have symptoms at all until a few days after treatment. I’ve had light pelvic pain. I did research and pelvic pain resolves within 2 weeks so I hope it clears by the 30th.

3,Doxycycline,Chlamydia Infection,3.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"October 28, 2021",0,I was tested positive for chlamydia for the second time. The first time I had one dosage of Azithromycin which cleared everything right up. A year later I tested positive again and was prescribed doxy for one week. The meds made me so sick I had no appetite. I felt so weak had heavy breathing By the third day I didn’t feel like myself at all. The symptoms actually got worse before they got better. The only reason I finished is b/c I am desperate to get rid of this STD. Literally my worse nightmare happened all over again.  I finished the meds and still have minor symptoms. I was also diagnosed with BV so idk if the symptoms are from chlamydia or BV. I have a doctors apt soon if I still have chlamydia I will be requesting something other than doxy.,Person A

I have a very weak stomach and have tried doxycycline twice now. This is my third time on it and I can honestly say that eating carbs for the morning pill have saved me. I’m on day 4 and already feel immensely better with the symptoms slowly diminishing. I know this medicine tells you it’s best on an empty stomach but the past two times taking this pill, I've thrown up at least one pill in the morning from not eating and it didn’t work. I even went to the pharmacy to get another pill to add it onto my week, but it still wasn’t enough. You need to take all your medicine in the same time frames evenly spread out (12 hours) I promise you, potatoes, bread, tater tots, or even mcdonald’s french fries!! whether you have to take this for a week or more, know you’re gonna get through this and feel 100x better.

A few days later I had a lot of discharge and initially my doc treated me for BV but I decided to take a STI test because I just knew something wasn't right with my body (always listen to your intuition). Been prescribed doxycycline 2 tablets a day for 2 weeks and so far so good. On day 3 my cramps disappeared entirely. Please eat before taking these pills and wait at least 1 hour before popping it in your mouth. The side effects are bad but only last 30 mins or so for me.

I tried taking the capsules with milk, before food, after food, with food, but nothing helped to stop the nausea.

No racing heartbeat as I am prone to palpitations (skipping beats or even fast heartbeat) as I cannot even have caffeine but had ZERO problems.I took Prilosec only with this drug as I am prone to reflux.  I ate 1.5 hours before taking this drug with 16oz water.  I would sit upright for 1 hour and then drink another 16oz bottle of water.  I would take a probiotic 2-3 hours after taking the antibiotic.  I should add that I was taking 3000mg of lysosomal vitamin C (not at the same time as the antibiotic and I took 1000mg 3 times a day), elderberry extract, zinc, fish oil, selenium, garlic, 5000 iu of D3/K2, Culturelle 15 billion CFU’s, and AZO cranberry supplements while on this antibiotic.

Luckily the doctors called me back and said my test was negative so I stopped taking the medication but now I am getting strong urges to pee and nothing is coming out?

Be careful what you wish for! 6 days into taking the medication I was suddenly displaying all the chlamydia symptoms, and by day 7 it had worsened.

She stated many people have had this problem, so please try and request the one off dose of another antibiotic  if possible and not the 100mg for a week.

55,Doxycycline,Chlamydia Infection,,Taken for less than 1 month,"September 12, 2017",10,It is obviously proven to treat Chlamydia there isn't any question about that. It's the side effects that are the problem.For me it caused me severe depression  that I never ever usually have. It has caused me to feel very emotionless and has completely deprived me of any ability for a genuine healthy sleeping pattern. It has caused me to throw up once (which started as violent shaking and a horrible nauseous feeling which ended in throwing up and going to sleep still shaking but no longer nauseous) and caused me nausea one more time (I didn't puke).Overall if there was any time in my life where my depression sunk to the absolute lowest  then it'd be now.

My main problem is I'm really aching and do feel like my anxiety level has increased.  I take two 100mg tablets a day.  Thank goodness I only have too take it for 4 more days as I'm taking other medication on top of this I'm not a big tablet taker at all and I've lost my appetite,Lip89

Lo and behold, swaps came back positive for chlamydia. (Ironically slightly relieved given the healing time of a fissure)After two days of the doxycycline I felt mild pain when passing a stool. 4 days later about 10% of the pain remained. 7 days later, assymptomatic.Side effects included; very mild dull headache about 3-4 hours after tablet, very loose stool throughout the entire course of administration, bloating (caffeine, lactose mainly), sunburn after 30-40 mins in direct sunlight. Despite these mild concerns the medication was perfect, I have almost no post treatment side effects. Try a daily clove of chopped garlic with it",0000000000007

Because my anxiety  I really didn't want to take any pills. I try to live very clean eating organic and exercise so this pill kills good bacteria in your stomach and that has a huge effect on your mental state and increases anxiety and stress. I feel better after taking it. But I lost my appetite and I wasn't taking probiotics which is a must. .  So in a week I lost close to 10 pounds. And my stress and anxiety was through the roof.
