0,Norethindrone,Birth Control,3.0,,"April 1, 2022",0,"I was switched to generic Norethindrone after years of taking combined pill because I have migraines and I take seizure medications, and I’m not wanting to use a non-pill BC at this time. I’ve been on this since mid January (a little over two months now). It has prevented pregnancy thus far and acne has been reduced, which are pluses, but I will say, everything else has gone severely downhill. I had two periods, the worst two of my whole life, in the first month of use. I’m constantly worried about pregnancy because of the constant use/no breaks and having to wait for my body to have a period or not. The nausea, headaches, fatigue, mood changes, and cramps have been ungodly, and I’ve actually experienced a decline in my sex drive.",Anonymous

I tried 2 other pills before this one, but they made me spot everyday. This one however, has been a life saver!  I’ve been on it for a year and it has minimized my periods to the point where I barely need a tampon, and my pain is basically non-existent.  It did take a few months for me to get my period’s flow to decrease, but the pain was gone by my first period on this pill, and it gradually eased the longer I took it.I also have not gotten pregnant on it which is a huge plus, but the period aspect is why I rate this pill so high, as it has truly made my life better and less exhausting.",M.S

I was on the combined pill for a year and was absolutely miserable. I started Jencycla a year and a half ago, and it has been an absolute joy! I got a few headaches in the beginning 3 months, which is very unusual for me, but also not debilitating, just annoying. It has completely stopped my periods and I have endometriosis, with very heavy bleeding and immense pain, so this was SUCH A RELIEF. Haven't had a period in a year and a half, best year and half of my LIFE. I read that it only does that for about 30-40% of people though. I'm also super forgetful but put them in my wallet so that they're with me anywhere I go, and an alarm everyday helps me remember taking them.If you have trouble with combined pills but still want oral birth control, this might be it! It also might not, but don't worry, trust your body!",Alloy

I am on day 24 of this pill pack, it is now in the garbage and I am typing this here. Why? I've spent the last 24 days experiencing waves of almost constant nausea throughout the day, despite the fact I'm taking it at night with a meal. I've been bleeding since the 8th day, and the first week of that bleeding was spotting, which is to be completely expected on any contraceptives. The week after that, it became heavier to where it's not breakthrough bleeding and it's not my period, doctor claims that to be ""normal"" I experienced extreme rage the first week on this pill, constant dizziness, headaches, cramps that feel like period pains, stomach pains, gas all the freaking time without changes my diet, and trouble sleeping because of the nausea.",Storm
6,Norethindrone,Birth Control,5.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"March 17, 2022",1,"Norlyda (norethindrone):Started this because my doctor was worried about my blood pressure on the combo pill. I’m on my second pack. The first two to three weeks my nipples were so sore. I haven't had sex since starting as my husband is deployed so I wasn’t worried about pregnancy. Once my nipples calmed down then my breast were tender as if I were about to start my period. I get hormonal headaches usually the week prior to my period but I had more than usual the 4th week of these pills. Then, no period and all the breast tenderness and headaches stopped as if I had my period. It’s strange. So, considering my husband was home before I started this pill I decided to take a pregnancy test, which was negative. So now I’m in my second pack wondering if I’m going to get a period of any kind or not. If I get the headaches again I intend on switching.",Heather

I already had like mild insomnia and now it’s like severe.  I'm awake and having these crazy hot flashes/night sweats all night every night and I never really fall asleep and I’m so tired. The mood swings from the pill are horrible too, the whole point of this was to like level out my mood not worsen it. My ADHD feels worse - the amount of brain fog I have throughout the day is way more than normal. I'm always nauseous throughout the day. My body always feels like it’s in pain even when I’m not on my period. My eyes always burn. My boobs hurt. I'm overly hungry. Every time I stand from sitting I feel even more like I’m gonna faint than I ever did before and the other week I literally like fell over because it. The only thing this pill has been good for is having sex without a condom lol, other than that, kinda sucks ass.",pix
8,Norethindrone,Birth Control,9.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"March 16, 2022",0,"Posting an updated review... Been on for a year now and things are going pretty good. No periods at all (other than some spotting, I think it's just when I don't take it on time) and I did bleed for about a week when first starting. My mood is still everywhere. I get annoyed very easily and I wouldn't say I'm depressed, but just kind of on autopilot and not the happiest most of the time. I was breaking out pretty bad the whole time but it just now seems to be calming down. I was getting more cystic acne than whiteheads/smaller breakouts. That's about all I have to say, I think it's worth a try if you need to/are interested in taking a mini pill. When first starting be aware bleeding is very unpredictable. I will continue to take it for now, don't have any major complaints. Also, still not pregnant. But I'm on time taking it 99.9% of the time.",GS03

I can tolerate this birth control for around 6 months consistently, then I have to take a month off to reset and then I restart. It is not ideal but it’s the best I’ve gotten so far. I’ve tried pretty much all birth controls- hormonal and the copper IUD. With this- I have noticed hair growth. Weight gain is something I struggle with so unsure if it’s related. I know it’s time to stop when my hair gets really greasy (I usually go 6 days between washes and it goes down to 1) and my skin breaks out very bad.

I got my period in December then January, around the same time.

I have the worst cramps I’ve ever experienced. I’ve gained 30lbs and can’t loose the weight. I switched to Errin from my original because it was giving me migraines and putting me at a higher risk of a stroke at my age (16/17 at the time I am now 19).

I had switched over from my old birth control which was a combination pill but got off that because of major headaches. The first 6 months on this pill were not bad at all. No headaches I felt normal but the only downside was that I felt very like emotionless, still do at times. I find I became very nonchalant towards a lot of things and I do believe it is from the birth control. The first 6 moths I had a very irregular cycle and still do. My period would come for about (7 days) then it would be gone for 2 months, and so on. After being on it for a bit over 6 months my cycle started to become more irregular. I had no period for about 3 months and then suddenly i had got my period and that period last a total of 15 days.

Even after I stopped taking norethindrone, I still struggle with bad acne that is just now beginning to heal after lots of trial and error on my part using different skincare products. Everybody is different, but for me, I wish my doctor had properly informed me that these side effects could happen because it has not been worth it .

I've noticed that since I started, my periods have been extremely light/nonexistent, and I no longer have passing out episodes when I do menstruate. I do take a pregnancy test every two weeks just in case though, but still no pregnancy scares here! I do recommend taking the pill with a piece of toast if you get nauseous easily. A downside I have noticed sadly is my hair has thinned. I also get pelvic cramps around the time I would be bleeding, just with no blood. Everyone is different though. I can't take any bc with estrogen because it made my entire left leg numb for two weeks straight.

I have always had regular periods and my doctor warned me that I may stop having periods altogether on this pill but I have continued to have regular periods. This is good for me because I am always paranoid of pregnancy even when I know I'm safe. I was previously on another pill that made me irritable and slightly depressed and I have felt 1,000x better on this pill. My mood has been stable. I will say that my cramps have remained the same since being on this pill (moderate pain for one day). So pretty much, almost every part of my body feels like I am not even taking a pill. My cycles have remained the same and my body pretty much goes through the same things it always has. I didn't have any major concerns when deciding a pill choice so I can't complain that it hasn't ""fixed"" my mild PMS symptoms.

I absolutely am not ok with the idea of a device being stuck in me for years, so I opted for the mini pill (Jencycla). The first 1.5 years on this pill was horrible. I bled for almost the entire month straight when I first switched. I developed cystic acne (never had acne in my life before), and I was constantly paranoid about my period because it would come multiple times a month as it pleased. It's almost been 4 years now since I started Jencycla and the last two years roughly has been pretty good.

The first month was a doozy to deal with because of all the breakthrough bleeding, seriously I bled or spotted the majority of the month; however, I set an alarm to take the pill at 9 and if I take it every day at the same time (or within 45 mins either way) I will not have any breakthroughs at all. So far this has helped me considerably with my mood swings, cleared up my hormonal acne, doesn’t trigger sugar cravings like before, no weight gain, more energy (except on my period, but that’s normal), my libido is higher than ever, and no pregnancy yay!

I am going to stay on this for a couple months to see if I can get adjusted with the bleeding. It has not led to any weight gain either which is a plus. Also, no pregnancy.

When I first started this pill, I wanted it to regulate my periods. Well, even the first few months of taking it, I lost periods all together. My migraines got extremely worse, as well as my anxiety and depression. I find myself confused a lot (like brain fog).Being on it for almost two years, I’ve possibly had maybe two periods that only lasted two days. Being someone who has PCOS, this always concerns me. It has also caused so many vaginal discomfort for me over the course of me taking it, as well as hormonal issues that clash very bad with my depression and anxiety. I feel like a completely different person since starting this, kind of like how you feel when you start antidepressants.

I bled for a good 10 days and expelled MASSIVE BLOOD CLOTS and on some days, I would fill my menstrual cup in about an hour. It was a nightmare. I decided to persevere and this morning, I woke up with NO BLEEDING....my breakthrough bleeding STOPPED. I'm in disbelief. I think the pill has finally kicked in.

I broke out with white heads (no change in cystic pimples) a lot more, especially around my period. I am seeing a dermatologist to correct this. I’d also like to note, TMI, but I had noticeably less annoyingly thick discharge on Errin. Overall, if you think you might have an estrogen sensitivity, it’s worth trying.

I'm currently on my 3rd period cycle (I had a period in April, June, and now October) which does not bother me too much since my gynecologist said irregular bleeding is common on ""minipills."" I also cannot take anything with estrogen because I get migraines with aura, so I was happy to find a pill that seems to work for me and help with my migraines! Just take into account the time sensitivity of minipills, and how important the timing of taking the pill is as this could lead to pregnancy as I've seen in other comments.

I didn’t think it was the pill but upon doing more research I found that maybe it has been the pill messing with my overall mental health. I’ve gained tremendous amount of weight. I eat like I normally would over the years but I feel like after starting the pill weight just packed on easier. And yeah I also don’t feel motivation to do much around the house, I think that comes from the depression. I was waiting for a full year of using it to pass to really be able to see if I liked it. I haven’t gotten pregnant since on it. So that works fine, but at the cost of my mental health and physical lol",Motherof3girls

I couldn't have sex in any position except missionary because it was too painful. The only thing it's ""helped"" with is not get me pregnant. Overall, awful experience with this, absolutely hated it. The weight gain has seriously ruined my self esteem and I can not tell you how awful sex is. Sex in the past never hurt for me, even my first time. I've always been very physical & loved sex.

I don’t know why, and I can’t find any literature on the issue, but it seems an increase in progesterone blocks my ability to fall and stay asleep. I was taking different sleep meds to try to help, but after about a week and half, I had to go off of the Micronor. I just can’t function without adequate sleep.

I am a marathon runner and also gym rat who watches what she eats, so I didn't understand the weight gain.  I don't know if I can get back on this one, but I have been trying others of the same active ingredients (trying each for at least four months).

I run, bike, go to yoga, and eat the same foods consistently. I finally decided to stop taking the pill two weeks ago and switch to Nuvaring.

I told them this was due to a bad med that didn't agree with me and left it at that. Did not mention it was birth control. I am a private person when it comes to my business. This pill turned me from a mellow person with a good sense of humor to this awful snappy witch who was slack in cleaning chores when I am normally a clean freak. It also made my hair more prone to breakage. I am back on a low dose levonorgestrel pill now and never felt better. Much calmer and bleeding has almost stopped. I don't recommend this minipill.

The goal was for me to take a birth control that would stop me from having a period, but that has not been successful. Other than me still having a period I feel fine. I will say every other birth control that I've ever tried made me nauseous. This one does not. My face has been breaking out a little more than usual but I'm still trying to figure out whether or not the birth control is the culprit.",Kikisses
