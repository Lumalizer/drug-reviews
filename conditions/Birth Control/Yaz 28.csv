0,Yaz 28,Birth Control,1.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"March 30, 2022",0,Loryna (drospirenone / ethinyl estradiol):I have only been on Loryna a month. Please avoid taking this birth control. I took one month and can't take it . I thought I was going crazy I don't even recognize my own house. I have severe anxiety to the point where I'm crying all day. And on top of it I'm having symptoms of IBS that I hope clear up cause I just can't deal with that. The stomach problems are so bad I've lost 15 pounds in less than a week cause of the extreme gastrointestinal symptoms.  I'm just hoping I can clear all this up please pray for me. I stopped taking the pills it has only been a day I just hope I can recover from the negative side effects this pill has caused. Correction I will recover its going to take time but I will get through this. AVOID LORYNA  at all cost and any birth control that contains that synthetic hormones drospirenone.,Chells

2,Yaz 28,Birth Control,6.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"March 27, 2022",0,"Ocella (drospirenone / ethinyl estradiol):I think this birth control is okay. It makes me really moody sometimes especially on my period I only get nauseous, heavy bleeding, headaches and cramps but other then that it’s not bad I have gained plenty of weight being on it and I get paranoid ONLY on my period. It seems impossible to get off the weight but it could be because I’ve been on pills for 5 1/2 years straight to make sure it’s a better chance I don’t have a child. When not on my period I get really sad sometimes for no reason at all.",Cats&Soup
3,Yaz 28,Birth Control,10.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"March 25, 2022",0,Loryna (drospirenone / ethinyl estradiol):As I read through the comments I want to remind everyone that we all have different bodies. Personally I have a high level of hormones and tend to break out often. I have tried multiple brands and have had pretty bad symptoms. I tried this brand and like all BC the first few weeks I had symptoms especially nausea as my body was getting adjusted. I’ve been taking this brand for about 2 years and now have beautiful skin and short/ less painful periods. If you have similar issues as I did I would highly recommend giving this brand a try. Hope this was helpful for other women who suffered from acne and elevated hormone levels.,Agata

I was taking the name brand Yazmin for years and I  never had any issues with it. I moved and the the pharmacist gave me the generic brand Syeda. I didn’t have any issues with it until 2 months in. I started experiencing the WORST anxiety and panic attacks, spotting, and the worst cramps. I have never had any of these issues before nor did I ever have anxiety or panic attacks until I started taking this. Do yourself a favor a steer clear of Syeda.",Anonymous

6,Yaz 28,Birth Control,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"March 23, 2022",1,"Loryna (drospirenone / ethinyl estradiol):I see so many negative reviews for Loryna but I thought I would write a positive one because there's probably a girl out there who was just like me and scared to death to switch birth controls because of all the horrid reviews. I took generic Ortho Tri Cyclen (Trinessa) for several years because I have acne alongside my need for BC. Ortho made me into a lunatic. It ramped up my emotions to the point of me damn near becoming psychotic. When I gave birth to my daughters I tried the Copper IUD, had it almost 3 years but got sick of the CONSTANT bleeding I was having. decided to get back on Ortho Tri Cyclen (this time called Tri-Lo-Mili) and immediately became a raging psychopath after only a few days of taking it. Now granted, I would've stuck it out, but I remembered how I was during the 3 years of Trinessa and the feelings were the exact same. I switched to Loryna and the first day there was immediate mental relief. I've had 0 negative side effects. Love this BC so much.",hannah

I had a baby in March 2020 and went onto the pill July 2021 (writing this in March 2022) - I went onto the pill and loved that it basically got rid of my period, I hardly ever bled. But I was SEVERELY anxious, borderline depressed. I went to see a psychologist and a psychiatrist for the first time in my life (I am 28) and I was basically diagnosed with delayed post partum depression. I never went onto the antidepressants because my gut told me not to. I am now off the pill for a mere 8 days and I feel better than I have felt over the past 9 months.

8,Yaz 28,Birth Control,1.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"March 16, 2022",0,"Yaz (drospirenone / ethinyl estradiol):I started Yaz because I wanted to switch from my old birth control. My gynecologist suggested Yaz because of the less days off of hormones. I finished out my last pack of my old pill and switched to Yaz. About 2 days into it I had severe stomach cramping. I didn’t put two and two together, I missed work for 2 days and honestly thought I was constipated. The cramping continued once I returned to work, it was throughout the day and food seemed to subside it at times. It would really hurt in the middle of the night and in the mid-afternoon. I debated going to the hospital or doctor to figure out what was wrong.Fast forward through the whole pack, I got the the placebo pills. Within two days the stomach cramps were gone. I thought whatever was wrong was better. I took my first hormone pill on  Sunday, and Monday I had intense cramping again. Not everyone is the same, so it may work for you, just was not a good experience for me",Anonymous
9,Yaz 28,Birth Control,9.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"March 7, 2022",0,"Yasmin (drospirenone / ethinyl estradiol):Took it for about 4 years, before I had the Diane for some years which is similar. Now I’m off it for also 2 years, using a copper IUD. Looking back, the Diane had me more depressed. The Yasmin gave me amazing spotless and vital skin, bigger boobs, nice smooth shiny hair, less peach fuzz on the rest of my body, stable mood, easy periods. The whole last year with the copper IUD has been horrible. In the 2 years without the pill my boobs shrunk incredibly, my sex drive is less, hair is very hard to manage and has a different structure, my skin has a lot of acne and wrinkles and the peach fuzz got a lot worse again. Really considering getting back on the Yasmin.",Monique

I have PCOS and struggled with heavy periods (sometimes twice a month), horrible cramps, mood swings and acne. Since starting Loryna I'm now able to skip my periods all together getting rid of almost all my negative side effects (still get pretty emotional around the time my period would come). I did gain about 10 lbs and my motivation to workout is almost pretty low. I used to go to the gym 5 days a week and eat healthy. I now crave unhealthy foods more and dread the gym. Maybe this is just an excuse lol but I had to stop for about two weeks due to my prescription being shipped to a previous address and immediately my motivation to workout and eat healthy came back.

I began taking it for my extremely irregular periods and the more obvious reason. Since taking it, my acne has significantly cleared up and my period has become completely regular now, coming at the exact same time every month with minimal cramps. It's also free with my insurance. The only downsides are that I cry more easily now (although I've always been a sensitive person so that's pretty normal for me) and I have more frequent migraines, but I've always had migraines and I'm not sure if it's the pill that has caused that.",19 y/old
14,Yaz 28,Birth Control,10.0,Taken for 10 years or more,"February 23, 2022",1,Yasmin (drospirenone / ethinyl estradiol):I have been on Yasmin for over 15 years. I have never had any issues other than switching from the Name Brand to the generic. This pill never gave breakouts or adverse reactions. My only issue is that my insurance company refused to cover the cost since it is the Name Brand. I have tried the generic and it is not the same. It produced greater PMS symptoms and also gave me hormonal acne. I am now 33 and considering going off the pill altogether in fear of starting something new. Has anyone else stopped Yasmin? If so could you please share your experience? I am a bit nervous - (not about having a baby) but any side effects from stopping the hormone??,Anonymous
15,Yaz 28,Birth Control,3.0,,"February 23, 2022",0,"Yaz (drospirenone / ethinyl estradiol):Everyone has different experiences, Yaz was not the pill for me. I was on it for 3 months, and while I was diligent about taking it and it did prevent pregnancy, the side effects I had to switch pills. My mood swings were AWFUL. One minute I’d be fine, and then I’d be biting someone’s head off for no reason and then I’d be sobbing for no reason. It also made my period symptoms worse. The cramping was bad! I had zero sex drive and my bleeding was heavier then I had experienced since middle school. It also did nothing to help with my acne, which I was really hoping it would. I am almost 26 and I’ve been on birth control since I was 14, but stopped for a year or 2 before I got into a serious relationship. This pill does not work for everyone.",Anonymous

I'm now 21 and have been on Yaz for 6 months with no luck. Whilst it cleared my acne well, the depression and anxiety that came with it has been unbearable. I have never suffered from any mental health issues in the past and it wasn't until reading these reviews about similar experiences that I realised I'm not crazy. I started having serious issues with my partner and I actually started blaming and resenting him, thinking he was the reason for my change in self confidence, happiness and overall mental wellbeing, I didn't even consider the pill until now. Not only that, but the anxiety has caused me to lose 5kg (making me quite under the healthy weight range) as I feel too sick in my stomach to have an appetite. I have also been continuously spotting for the last 4 out 6 months, contributing to my already low iron levels. Time to cease using YAZ.",Anon

My acne did clear up, but I also got older and stopped soccer, so I wasn’t sweating all summer, so there could’ve been that correlation too. There’s been no help with my mood or emotions and it’s starting making me very bloated, even though I’ve had the same exercise regime. I do think it’s made me more prone to anxiety and intrusive thoughts, but it hasn’t been debilitating.

I have never had a vein show in my finger, so I immediately realized I had 2 blood clots: one in my middle finger, and one in my pointer finger. I have tested negative for Factor Five (a blood clotting disorder) and do not smoke. I was already hesitant to start this birth control considering the lawsuits, but my PCOS/ endometriosis is a huge problem and leaves me in pain 24/7 that I’m desperate to try anything that works.

I haven't noticed any other side effects which is why I feel it should be an 8/10. I think people tend to write reviews when they have a negative experience but people should know it’s not all bad. I have definitely noticed the effects here and there but I overall feel good and it doesn't really effect my life other than remembering to take it. I would recommend it.

But this has made the beginning of our marriage lacking sex because I'm on my menstrual cycle more than I'm off it!",kayd315

The first month was a bit hectic emotionally. Periods were regulated, but cramps were only slightly lessened and periods did not decrease in length (stayed at my normal 4-5 days). I decided to go off of Syeda after I moved pharmacies and was unable to take it for a month. After getting off for that month, I recognized my mood/anxiety being noticeably better than when I was on.

Consulted doctor while overseas and he mentioned my pulse was very slow.

My doctor never mentioned anything about the possible changes my body would go through when I discontinued the drug. Turns out that birth control can completely alter the flora in your digestive tract. I began experiencing serious digestive issues and my doctor told me that I had IBS and was put on Viberzi. A few weeks later I was having severe gallbladder pain and I had to have my gallbladder removed. I have read that birth control can cause gall bladder issues too so I think I just had an all around bad experience when I decided to go off of this drug and I was not given any warning. I just want to let other women know that this drug is effective, however you need to be very aware of the changes it can make to your body.",P

I had AWFUL weight gain with both. I didn't change my diet, it was all water weight that was lost w/in a week of stopping the pills. So far on Ocella I have not gained any weight and do not feel bloated/ puffy. I am assuming that has to do with the  diuretic  effect of the progestin?  which I am all for if it keeps bloating at bay! The first few days of taking this pill I had extreme nausea but that went away. I also had a few headaches but I got that before taking Ocella.

It took me a long time to realize but towards the end of the pack, right before I started bleeding I would get really depressed and anxious, which was nothing new to me, but it would always happen on the same day every month.

It was an effective form of birth control, which was the major reason I used it for, but similar to the shot I had almost no libido, was very emotional and had bad acne. My fiance kept bringing up Yaz. I decided to give it a shot since he put up with me so long. I've been happy, acne is going away, no bad side effects and libido is up.

I do agree, however, that it does make me a little tired and I do have some headaches (during the period week)- but nothing like the monster headaches I got on some other brands.
