0,Jencycla,Birth Control,1.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"March 31, 2022",0,"I’ve been taking this for over half a year now because my doctor recommended me to take this after experiencing some migraines with my previous birth control. So far, I’ve only had 4-5 day breaks in between my periods (lasting up 8-9 days) and now I've had my period for 3 months non-stop.",Asdf
1,Jencycla,Birth Control,10.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"March 27, 2022",0,"I used to have extremely painful periods, super heavy and cramps that could not be alleviated with painkillers, so I turned to birth control.  I tried 2 other pills before this one, but they made me spot everyday. This one however, has been a life saver!  I’ve been on it for a year and it has minimized my periods to the point where I barely need a tampon, and my pain is basically non-existent.  It did take a few months for me to get my period’s flow to decrease, but the pain was gone by my first period on this pill, and it gradually eased the longer I took it.I also have not gotten pregnant on it which is a huge plus, but the period aspect is why I rate this pill so high, as it has truly made my life better and less exhausting.",M.S
2,Jencycla,Birth Control,9.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"March 24, 2022",0,"I see that this pill didn't work for a lot of people, but don't get discouraged if your doctor prescribes it to you! I was on the combined pill for a year and was absolutely miserable. I started Jencycla a year and a half ago, and it has been an absolute joy! I got a few headaches in the beginning 3 months, which is very unusual for me, but also not debilitating, just annoying. It has completely stopped my periods and I have endometriosis, with very heavy bleeding and immense pain, so this was SUCH A RELIEF. Haven't had a period in a year and a half, best year and half of my LIFE. I read that it only does that for about 30-40% of people though. I'm also super forgetful but put them in my wallet so that they're with me anywhere I go, and an alarm everyday helps me remember taking them.If you have trouble with combined pills but still want oral birth control, this might be it! It also might not, but don't worry, trust your body!",Alloy
3,Jencycla,Birth Control,10.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"March 3, 2022",0,"I have tried many different forms of birth control. I'm 34 year old a mom of 5 and this is the first time trying the minipill, I am very satisfied. The first couple of months took a bit of getting used to; some spotting but sorted itself out over time, significantly decreased my difficult periods. Decrease in migraine headaches as well.",Mae
4,Jencycla,Birth Control,,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"February 2, 2022",0,"I’ve been on this birth control for over a year now and here’s my experience. I had switched over from my old birth control which was a combination pill but got off that because of major headaches. The first 6 months on this pill were not bad at all. No headaches I felt normal but the only downside was that I felt very like emotionless, still do at times. I find I became very nonchalant towards a lot of things and I do believe it is from the birth control. The first 6 moths I had a very irregular cycle and still do. My period would come for about (7 days) then it would be gone for 2 months, and so on. After being on it for a bit over 6 months my cycle started to become more irregular. I had no period for about 3 months and then suddenly i had got my period and that period last a total of 15 days. The last few days were spotting but still the bleeding didn’t completely stop after day 15. Since then I get very irregular bleeding and spotting out of no where. I do bleed sometimes after sex.",Tina
5,Jencycla,Birth Control,6.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"January 2, 2022",1,"I started taking Tricyclen-Lo at 17 years old due to heavy,  irregular bleeding. That pill worked perfectly for me for ten years. I had zero issues and my period was like clockwork while on it. However, I noticed the last couple of years while on it that I would randomly get migraines with aura a few times a year so I told my doctor. She said my options were the mini pill or the IUD. I absolutely am not ok with the idea of a device being stuck in me for years, so I opted for the mini pill (Jencycla). The first 1.5 years on this pill was horrible. I bled for almost the entire month straight when I first switched. I developed cystic acne (never had acne in my life before), and I was constantly paranoid about my period because it would come multiple times a month as it pleased. It's almost been 4 years now since I started Jencycla and the last two years roughly has been pretty good. My body finally regulated my cycle give or take a few days but I no longer worry about getting my period randomly.",Kerri
6,Jencycla,Birth Control,1.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"November 2, 2021",1,"This is by far the worst birth control I have tried!!!! My face was as clear as a baby’s bottom my entire life. I switched to Jencycla and started breaking out horribly. I am now on month 4 of the pills and have the worst acne all over my forehead, checks and chin. This was my last month on this pill.

7,Jencycla,Birth Control,9.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"October 29, 2021",0,"I've been on Jencycla for 4 months now, and I am having a positive experience with it overall. My body had to adjust to it in the first month, but after that it's been great.  I have the factor v leiden mutation which affects blood clotting, so I needed to take a non estrogen pill.  In the first month:1.  I became more prone to acne, and had a major breakout.2. My period was 3 days instead of 6. After that first month:1.  My acne cleared; I also started paying more attention to my skincare, so I have no idea if the acne cleared because my body adjusted to the pill or if it was the skincare routine or both.2. My period is back to 6 days3. I now have little to no PMS/PMDD symptoms, this is wonderful, I used to get so depressed, irritable, moody, bloat, extreme hunger, and sore boobs, before my period but now at the most I might just be more sensitive and a little sad.And still no sign of pregnancy!I would recommend this, please note everyone reacts differently.",Drae
8,Jencycla,Birth Control,7.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"October 9, 2021",0,"I have been taking Jencycla for about 4 years now. I can't take estrogen only because it gave me migraines. I have not gotten pregnant, but ever since I started taking it I began gaining weight and its only gotten worse since. My periods are very irregular. It can vary anywhere between 25-50 days in between periods with no real pattern. I will also spot a lot of times in between as well. The good thing is it has reduced PMS symptoms drastically and I noticed when I tried to stop taking it, the cramps without birth control were so bad I could hardly move, so right now I am sticking with it to help with the pain.",Jess
9,Jencycla,Birth Control,2.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"October 5, 2021",2,"My experience with Jencycla was absolutely horrendous.

13,Jencycla,Birth Control,7.0,,"July 1, 2021",3,"I started Jencycla just over 4 months ago because I have a history of migraines with auras and the dr wouldn’t give me combined birth control (even though I haven’t had a migraine in over 2 years). I was told my body would adjust in 3 months, but so far my cycles have been all over the place and I spot every month on random days. I had a regular cycle, then skipped a whole month with a 45 day cycle, then I had a 24 day cycle, then a 22 day cycle so I’ve gotten my period twice in 1 month, both times for 7 days so I bled for half the month. So now I can’t predict when I’m getting my period and I can’t predict when I’m spotting either, it’s affecting my life. I’ve also been more moody and cranky than ever in my life. I haven’t gotten pregnant so that’s a plus, I’m very careful to take the pill the same time every day. Just wish I could take something that would regulate my period",Anonymous
14,Jencycla,Birth Control,1.0,,"May 31, 2021",2,"I decided in 2021 to get back on birth control and I ended up having high blood pressure when I went to the dr to get on it (I’m sure that was from nerves cause I’ve checked it 100+ times since and it’s been fine) But they give me Jencycla due to me having high BP. I have been on ortho tri cyclen lo in the past for 6+ years and it was perfect. I started Jencycla and the first month was fine. I even ovulated on it (I have severe pains when I ovulate, completely normal for me) Anyways, the first month on it was ok. The period I had after taking it the first month was pretty rough, I had clots, lots of them.. well my period finally ended. I was blood free for about 4 days then BOOM out of nowhere I start bleeding. HEAVY. On cycle day 11 I should NOT  be bleeding at all. I’m on CD 14 and still bleeding. When I should be ovulating, I’m bleeding. I have had severe stomach cramps after taking the pill the past few days. I have not felt like myself at all. I’m calling it quits on Jencycla",XxQUEENxX

I have tried about every birth control nothing else has really worked for me. my only issue with Jencycla was that I did get pregnant while on it.

Starting Jencycla everything was going okay I felt a little better but after a month I started getting confused a lot & of course thought it was normal as I was starting a new pill right? Wrong, Curiosity got the best of me 1 1/2 months into the pill come to find out this is a severe side effect of this pill. Since finding out I have stopped taking it and I haven't got a period the 2 1/2 month I've been on it either.

Hair breakage has been a huge issue for me, but it wasn’t until I got my period back at 9 months postpartum with spotting in between that I started doing research and realized it could be the pill causing all of this. Moodiness has been terrible, but I also have had fatigue and frequent headaches. I have been on this for months and I am stopping it.",KDW

I took it for 3 months, when I went to get more filled, my prescription suddenly changed to Movisse without doctor or pharmacist telling me which I found weird. Both brands though have made my skin absolutely terrible. I have break outs all the time, when I usually have pretty clear skin. My periods have been incredibly inconsistent. I used to take Alesse but had to get changed to a BC pill with no estrogen as I was getting blood clots in my leg!! I used to have my period at the same time for 3 days ish when I was on Alesse. Since taking the estrogen free pills, I've skipped my period altogether 2 or 3 times, if I do get it, it lasts for 7 or 8 days which is incredibly annoying.

I am prone to migraines so doctor gave me a progesterone only pill and its been very effective at stopping pregnancy (which is my main reason for using it) but it doesn't offer many other benefits. My skin hasn't really improved but it hasn't gotten any worse either, weight stayed the same, and mood wasn't affected. First 2 or so months on it I was definitely tired and sluggish but my body got used to it. One side effect I don't really like is that every 3 or 4 months my period will be about 2 weeks late.

My period stopped for 5 days and now I'm bleeding again. In a little over a month, I've gained close to 5lbs, my skin feels different, I have on/off depression and moodiness, and seriously the random and constant cramping. Also, I don't know if anyone else has noticed this but I swear I can smell chemicals from my skin and it only started once I started taking this birth control. It's a very noticeable and strong chemical smell that's especially strong on my hands......no amount of washing with soap gets rid of it.

26,Jencycla,Birth Control,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"August 24, 2020",5,"I’m 41 and was prescribed Jencycla after recently having my last child a few months ago. Within a few days of starting Jencycla I had hives on my chest which spread to bumps on my hands and arms (some filled with fluid) as well as hives on the front and back of my thighs and legs. Due to COVID and having two small children I’ve not been out of the house (nor has my spouse). I’ve also not tried any new foods or detergents, or done any outside yard work. The only new thing I’ve been exposed to is this birth control. I stopped after reading a similar review on here and my itching resolved within 24 hours, however the skin blotches and bumps will take days to resolve.  In total I took this birth control for 7 days. Maybe it would have resolved itself but the discomfort and physical embarrassment/unsightly look weren’t worth it. I’ve previously taken other birth control pill brands  (16 years in total) without any issue. I will never try this one again.",TX gal

This is the first time I use birth control so IDK how to compare to other pills but I honestly feel like this caused me postpartum depression. I feel on edge most days and really overall depression. I didn’t think it was the pill but upon doing more research I found that maybe it has been the pill messing with my overall mental health. I’ve gained tremendous amount of weight. I eat like I normally would over the years but I feel like after starting the pill weight just packed on easier. And yeah I also don’t feel motivation to do much around the house, I think that comes from the depression. I was waiting for a full year of using it to pass to really be able to see if I liked it.

I told them this was due to a bad med that didn't agree with me and left it at that. Did not mention it was birth control. I am a private person when it comes to my business. This pill turned me from a mellow person with a good sense of humor to this awful snappy witch who was slack in cleaning chores when I am normally a clean freak. It also made my hair more prone to breakage. I am back on a low dose levonorgestrel pill now and never felt better. Much calmer and bleeding has almost stopped. I don't recommend this minipill.
