2,Junel,Birth Control,4.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"March 31, 2022",0,"Junel Fe 1/20 (ethinyl estradiol / norethindrone):Let me start by saying everyone’s body reacts differently to any hormonal substance! I started Junel FE around late 2021, as Sprintec caused me to have breakthrough bleeding after being on it for 5ish years. During the first and second month of being on this pill I had begun feeling depressed, which sucked as I hadn’t dealt with that before. I also had break through bleeding for a bit which was super annoying. But I decided to stick it out, knowing my body was just slowly getting used to the new pill. It has now been about 4 or 5 months on Junel, and I honestly want to go cold turkey right now. I’ve had intrusive thoughts constantly, depression, anger, and no sex drive. The only pros of Junel are that my period is only 3 days long, and I only have cramps on the first day. Plus I haven’t gotten pregnant. I’m hoping to find a better source of (non-horomonal) contraceptive soon!",unknownwoman

My doctor told me I would see results in two weeks and I’m now on week 3 and nothing has changed. My acne actually got worse and the main reason my mom had me start this pill was to clear up my acne she’s been complaining about. I know it’s early but I’m getting really frustrated that things are getting worse and these reviews aren’t helping. I’m open to hearing someone’s thoughts about this.,Keira

8,Junel,Birth Control,3.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"March 24, 2022",0,"Junel 1.5/30 (ethinyl estradiol / norethindrone):Horrible. It made my periods easier and made me bleed way less and only for 3 days. Everything was amazing at first. Then I started having high prolactin levels and my breast would leak after every period for 1-2 weeks. I’ve never been pregnant nor had sex so this was horrible. My boobs swell and I was in severe pain. It helps if you have horrible periods but if you use it to skip or just use it long enough, eventually it messes up your hormones. I got tested and wasted so much money just to find out it was my BC causing this. Please be very careful if your breast start leaking or if it causes you to faint. The doctors won’t believe you but the tests never lie.",SuperDope
9,Junel,Birth Control,8.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"March 24, 2022",0,Blisovi Fe 1/20 (ethinyl estradiol / norethindrone):Been on the pill for probably around a year. I have noticed me gaining weight but my workout and eating habits definitely factor into that. I do find myself nauseous a lot but I correlate that to acid reflux and previous anxiety issues. I don’t really see any negative side effects besides feeling irritable and on edge on the placebo week but it’s helped my periods and ton and I have clear skin.

I’ve never been this depressed or having anxiety this bad in my life. My feelings get hurt so easily and I cry almost every day. I can’t control myself when I get the feeling of crying. I’ve cried in front of my family and friends which I used to never do because it used to take a lot for me to cry. It’s also made me feel really insecure with myself and think so badly of myself because it’s made me so depressed and think so negatively about any and everything in my life.

I have noticed  the last three months I have had terrible PMS moods. I become extremely angry and set off as well as fatigued before or during the placebo pills. I’m going to keep tracking my moods on Fitbit— try to pin point what’s going on. I also noted that when it comes to that last week I have skipped the last blue pill or two before placebo. At, times I have missed a pill or two.  I wonder if this could be affecting things w/ abrupt drop in hormones. I’m going to make sure I take exactly on schedule if I have to set a phone alarm.

I have tried everything from Yaz to Lo Loestrin to Apri and this has been the ONLY birth control my body is fine on. Yeah there was a brief month where my mental health was rough, but that wasn’t from the birth control itself (turns out thyroid conditions and PCOS can be a beast until they are figured out). This was the first one I ever tried and any time it’s been changed I start dreaming of when I can go back on this one. If you do have issues from it or any birth control, it probably is from another hormonal issue so don’t write it off completely.",Anonymous

I have been taking Junel for 10 months and the last month of taking it I experience crippling anxiety. I had panic attacks and suicidal thoughts. I had the random thought to check out the side effects of Junel since it was the only prescription medicine I was taking and was shocked by the reviews. It seems pretty 50/50 but most of the people who had bad experiences talked about anxiety being a huge issue. I also realized the things I had been dealing with for months are also listed under side effects (hair loss, water retention, difficultly wearing contacts, insomnia, leg cramps, reduced tolerance to carbs) and quickly decided to discontinue use. It has only been just over a week but I can already feel such a difference. I still experience anxiety daily but such a little amount compared to before.

I take birth control because my period is very long, heavy, painful, etc. I was on Lolestrin Fe before taking this and it was actually working but I still wanted a shorter period. Unfortunately in the first month on Blisovi Fe my period lasted about 11 days and less then a week later it started again. It also made me extremely anxious and depressed, to the point of panic attacks almost every week, which is not normal for me. I’ve lost a few pounds while on Blisovi but am constantly bloated since I started taking it. I also started noticing an increase in sinus and respiratory problems which could also be related to this medication. Overall I do not recommend this product.",Cory

I am a rather happy person who is very outgoing and talkative but this pill, it put me into a depressive mood, I lost interest in my hobbies, studies etc and I would start crying and couldn’t stop most of the time.

Honestly I didn’t have very many side effects except for low libido/dryness and irregular periods. My periods were so irregular, I'd get a period in the middle of my pack and sometimes I’d go months without them. It kinda sucked because I would never know if I was pregnant or not because I didn’t know when my period was supposed to come. Since I had low libido I experienced terrible dryness which is uncomfortable and embarrassing :/ . my skin was always super clear on it though!!

21,Junel,Birth Control,1.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"March 16, 2022",0,"Lo Loestrin Fe (ethinyl estradiol / norethindrone):I took this because a nurse practitioner recommended it for heavy periods. It did make my flow lighter for the most part, HOWEVER- I had breakthrough bleeding 3/4 months on it, lasting probably a total of 10-15 days out of the month. Enough to need to wear a pad. I have been more depressed than I ever have been in my life. I have had panic attacks frequently, which were never that big of a problem for me. The worst part has been weight gain. I have gained 5 pounds in 4 months despite the fact that my weight had been stable for 7 years. I am constantly hungry - actually starving to the point of sickness if I don't eat. It didn't change my libido, but I don't want to engage in intercourse if I'm bleeding. I will stop this birth control and seek an ablation. Plus, it's extremely expensive and most insurance plans don't cover it. I am mad at the nurse practitioner for recommending this pill.",36 YO woman

23,Junel,Birth Control,8.0,Taken for 5 to 10 years,"March 15, 2022",0,"Lo Loestrin Fe (ethinyl estradiol / norethindrone):I went on Lolo when I was 16 to help with acne and heavy flow. Needless to say I’m still on it 8 years later. It stopped my period all together after a month or so. Saw my gyno because of it and was cleared since this can happen with lolo. Before this birth control, I was going through 5 or more super plus tampons a day. So I can’t complain about the lack of period. In terms of acne reducing, this is where it  loses some points. It did help reduce my cystic acne, but it didn’t clear my skin either. I had to go on spironolactone a couple years later to actually clear my skin completely. Regarding weight change, I did not see any huge change. I do struggle with weight loss, but I also have a hypothyroid. With mental health, depression runs in my family genetically, and surprisingly it did not increase any intrusive thoughts. It actually  helped regulate them.

I was on Nuvaring for 3 years prior and I started realizing the 3rd year that I had gained over 30 lbs and could not get it off for the life of me. I went off of Nuvaring about 6 months ago and my weight drastically started going down! I am able to control my weight and lose it. Cons of Blisovi Fe 1/20 is that I have spotting in the middle of the month before my period and it continues into my period. Then I get about a week free of spotting and that has been since I started. I realized that I was nauseous when I first started. I thought it was from Covid and taking vitamins on an empty stomach but it was definitely the pill the first 2 months. Now I take the pill in the morning with no nausea. My stomach has been more upset then usual so maybe that’s a con, I’m not sure. As for sleeping, I could barely get 5 hours of sleep on Nuvaring and now I can at least get 7 hrs and I feel a bit more energetic.",changed

I struggle with depression and anxiety, and I was hoping it would have helped. I’ve also gained nearly 10 pounds in the month I’ve been on it (I’m 22 and run about 3 miles a day).

Fast forward to now, and the long-term effects of this pill are coming to light. I've gained 22 lbs since I started (without any changes to diet/exercise), and am still slowly climbing. My body doesn't cooperate with me during exercise like it used to, and I feel out of energy. Also, I stopped getting my period altogether. The most I've ever gotten is a tiny bit of dark-colored discharge during my placebo weeks. I get ""hot flashes"" about 5-6 hours after taking my pill every day and constantly feel warm.

I also have been having more headaches and stomach aches than usual. Especially when I first started taking this pill, lots of headaches.

After surgery the doctor told me the endo would come back if I didn't start hormonal therapy to suppress my periods. I was against it and waited until August to convince myself to start LoLo.

I would fall asleep every early afternoon and sleep for two or three hours.  I NEEDED a nap.  It was a family joke, a friend group joke.  I never connected it to my birth control.  That issue was the same issue for the full five years.  The last two years on it, however, I also lost my libido and felt totally disinterested in sex and less joyful that I'd ever felt.

My experience with this pill was the first month taking it I bled for a couple months and had on and off nausea. But after that I noticed that I was gaining weight. Not in my stomach but more in all the right places which my genetics play a part.  Ay appetite was increased and it never worsened my anxiety or depression.

Now I was hesitant at first but I’ve been taking it for a month and I have been feeling nauseous, I even felt so bad I had to force it out of my system. I’ve been having yeast infections as well. Also HOO WEE the weight gain. Now, I’m 5’6 and I have a fast metabolism so I was always 120 and always had a good body, but after taking this I have stomach fat and now weight 135lb. I could essentially work out cause I don’t but it’s crazy that a birth control is messing with my hormones that much that I have to go to that length. I also have depression and anxiety sometimes but I just feel more unmotivated than usual, which isn’t helping cause I’m in school. Anyways the only maybe good thing is that you may not get your period but this ain’t worth it.

I was on it for two months before I had to stop because I couldn’t handle the side effects anymore. I never stopped being starving the entire time, regardless of how much I ate. This caused me to feel bloated and miserable all of the time. It caused awful acne that never heals and causes scarring every time I get even a small zit that still hasn’t stopped over a year and a half later. While on the birth control I would have my period starting on day 7 of the pack and it would last until I started a new pack. Birth controls are very individual so it may work great for others. However, my gynecologist refused to take any of my symptoms seriously and yelled at me when I refused to continue taking it.

I took it for about 8 months and then stopped because I felt like it truly wasn’t doing anything for me and I don’t like taking unnecessary medications. 2 years later I’m taking it again for its actual purpose and it’s month 5 and I have had terrible mood swings and spotting 2-3 times a month. I’ll be stopping this birth control and giving my body a break. Not sure if I’ll try something else. I’m giving it a 3 because the mood swings and depressed mood is enough to make me stop it but I didn’t experience any other side effects but maybe low sex drive.,jhuck1999

First few months I was dealing with very painful and sore breasts, headaches within an hour of taking my pill (I took it at 9pm so that I could fall asleep after due to the headaches) and bloating. At month 3 I was having some anxiety, unreasonable irritation at anything and everything, and random crying. but once I hit month 4 everything changed! The breast pain stopped the headaches stopped I felt like my normal self again, calm, kind, relaxed, no more bloating, my skin was really clear, and at my 6 month visit with my gyno I was down in weight. I think with all birth control you need to give it some time to regulate your hormones.  I definitely talked about stopping the pills during that 3rd month but I am really glad that I waited it out because I feel back to normal and I don't have to worry about an unplanned pregnancy.",Shell

It also cleared up some bumps on my forehead for a few months. I didn’t notice many side effects at first and they might not be the same for everyone. I have now realized it’s made me anxiety worse and I cry a lot more often (think 1-2 a year (which is not necessarily great I know) to 2-3 times a month). These crying episodes are not always logical ie cried because I bumped the sidewalk while parking or cried because I had leftovers for breakfast. I also have more digestive issues. I’m not sure they are directly associated to the pill but as soon as I started the medication it made me constipated and I’ve now had on and off constipation ever since starting the pill.

For the weeks, I had some minor headaches and bloating, minor weight gain (maybe 1.5 - 2 pounds), and breast pain. I was willing put up with the physical discomforts, but what made me discontinue Junel after 1 month was the depression and anxiety. I do have a history of post-partum depression, so it's possible that I am just one of those who is more at risk for depression with *any* BC.

What forced me to write this review however was the back acne it caused along with hormonal acne under my chin. I have very sensitive dry skin and all of a sudden my skin was oily and breaking out. I tried every trick in the book to get rid of it until switching birth controls was the last resort. Within 10 days my skin was back to normal and my back was completely clear like before. So if you’re having skin issues consider that it might be this brand and switch. Everyone told me how unlikely it was and I’m glad I listened to my instincts.",babla

I am 22, and had recently found out I had PCOS after one of my many cysts, grew to be 4 inches and I had to have surgery. So taking the hormonal birth control, was not really for me to prevent a pregnancy, but more so of preventing another large cyst and other symptoms that come from PCOS; facial hair/ body hair, acne, losing scalp hair, etc. I had advised my doctor that although I have not been clinically diagnosed, I do have anxiety. After 4 months on this particular birth control, I can say that my anxiety has definitely  exacerbated.  Some days I don't know if I can continue taking it because I get so anxious. I find that with jogging/ walking, being outside, and making time for myself, I can manage the anxiety somewhat. I have not had any weight gain.

But I've seen a lot of comments on here from short term Junel users and wanted to give some feedback from a long term user. It's been great to me and unless I find out its causing my weight gain after all this time I'll probably never switch. I also skip my periods until I start spotting then I know it's time to have one.

The week before my period I tend to have mood swings, increased anxiety, and be very sensitive, but I was doing better than usual on Junel Fe. I also feel like it reduced a bit of my anxiety. I chose not to skip my period, and I usually get debilitating period cramps, but Junel Fe pretty much erased them. I did not experience any changes to my skin, weight, or appearance.

So the first 8 days, I felt so emotional. specifically I felt like crying at anything -  sad, happy, whatever it was I felt like crying. I am not typically a very emotional person so I could tell it was from the birth control. It went away during the second week. Then for the next 4-5 days I had spotting and some days a full out period and really bad cramps. It started freaking me out cause of all the reviews saying they have had a period for 3 months. After 5 days it went away. Honestly now I feel pretty great. No other changes. I’ve lost 3 lbs but I think that could just be my diet. My skin is staying clear. So I am hoping this works out.

I picked fights with my partner and raised my tone with my daughter way more than I should have. My periods became unpredictable on this birth control as well. Every month around my period my anxiety sky rocketed. Sore breasts and acne. NO sex drive at all. It’s day four off of this and for the first time in months I woke up feeling like myself and not a monster. -10/10 for me.,Waxedlemons

I still am feeling pretty depressed and anxious almost everyday while taking this pill but the nausea has subsided. I didn’t really notice a change in my weight but my appetite definitely decreased. I have noticed that my hair is definitely thinner and after reading the reviews again I’m realizing that this definitely could be because of the birth control. I still get my period but it is very light. I still am continuing to get cramps and nausea and my regular PMS symptoms the week where I do not take the pill and get my period and so I am planning to switch pills since it’s not helping me in this department. Overall this pill prevented pregnancy and I didn’t have any major symptoms except for mood swings but it just didn’t really do anything for me in terms of helping my PMS symptoms.,hi

I have tender breasts, terrible irritability, and I mean BAD & very emotional. The smallest things have been setting me off and I’m not normally like that at all except for 1-2 days before I begin my period. I have also noticed increased appetite and that worries me as well because I don’t want to gain weight due to a birth control.

I was given instruction to take it everyday, skip the placebo pills (which start your period), and start the next pack.

I initially thought that the symptoms I listed above were coming from the stress and uncertainty of COVID and the huge shift in everyday life but after trial and error I've found that it's definitely the birth control. Being off of the birth control for a week or two has completely brought me back to myself and I haven't had any of the negative symptoms.

I discontinued and started with the nuvaring because of how much of a negative impact the lolo had on my mood. I would have mood swings, ranging from anger to depression and suicidal thoughts. What’s even worse is that the hormones in it caused my pH to be off balance so I was constantly either getting a yeast infection or BV EVERY MONTH. It was miserable! After speaking with my gyn she recommended going on nuvaring because it constantly gives you the same amount of estrogen and lessens the chance of you getting an infection because the hormones are constant- versus lolo is always up and down with the hormones. Since switching, I haven’t gotten any more infections, my mood is normal again and I haven’t experienced crazy back pain, cramps, etc like I did with Lolo. I would recommend anyone to try nuvaring or another birth control that ISN’T loestrin.",Lucy

Here are my Pros : it kept my period on track. I knew when I was going to get it. Before I started I would have heavy and long periods with blisovi it kept it light and short. As well as my cramps they weren’t super painful as before. Cons: I’ve had anxiety for about 2 years and this pill has really took a toll on my mental health. I’ve had crazy panic attacks. My anxiety was super high. I felt like I was going into this stage where I wasn’t able to control my emotions at some point. I felt super depressed because of the way I was feeling I wouldn’t get out of bed and was sad because this wasn’t who I was.

About 2 weeks after starting the pill, I got a UTI. From that day on, I was on a roller coaster of back to back UTIs, BV, and yeast. UTI, BV, yeast. I've spent hundreds of dollars on medication and doctor's appointments to fix these issues, and my body still isn't right. PLEASE don't take this pill without considering the potential effects on the bladder, urinary tract, and vaginal tissue. I had no mood changes, no weight gain, and no loss of sex drive, but these were minor pros compared to the cons. I was also having two periods/month - one heavy one in the middle of the active pills, and one during the placebo week (withdrawal bleeding, I'm guessing). Please be careful!",Val S.

But I noticed once I started my second pack my mood swings calmed down a bit. I guess it was just my body adjusting to it. I haven't experienced any sudden weight gain. I am currently working out and eating right so maybe that's a plus. One negative thing I will say though is that it has made my acne WORST even though it says it's supposed to clear it.

It's not worth your life!I've been on this birth control since December of 2019 (today is 10/16/2020). I experienced the weight gain, but kept taking it due to the effectiveness of the birth control itself. About a month ago, I began experiencing bad headaches that would come on in the evenings. After 3 hours and multiple tests in the ER, I was told I was being admitted due to having a double pulmonary embolism (2 blood clots) in my right lung. The next morning, the doctor came in and told me that I need to immediately stop taking Tarina, due to that being the cause of the clots. Now, I have to spend the next 6 months at minimum on Eliquist and Xeralto and simply hope they are effective. I can't pick up my 3 year old and am basically restricted to a light-duty lifestyle until I have a medical green light. PLEASE, please, reconsider taking this birth control.

Furthermore, this birth control made my period much lighter and shorter which is a huge plus for me.

I experienced a significantly decreased libido, no interest in my partner or sex, painful sex (during and sometimes after), mysterious pelvic pain, random nausea, mental fog, subdued emotions, an overall feeling of sadness that couldn’t be explained, and unbearable migraines on the second day of the placebo weeks which left me immobile for the entire day. The only benefits were that it cleared up my acne and protected me against pregnancy. This pill was not for me and I will be switching. For reference, I’m in my early 20’s and weigh 132lbs.",Brie

However, I am now on my third month of the pill and I have had no negative side effects and I honestly really like it. This pill has made me feel normal again. I was emotional at the beginning of taking it, but my hormones have balanced out since. The only thing besides that that has happened is that I have lost 10 pounds, which is honestly very nice. For me, this pill has definitely decreased my appetite. Don't let the negative reviews scare you away, it reacts differently for everyone!",Anonymous

Over the course of those three months, it gradually got better. I am no longer depressed, forgetful, or disassociated, but I do experience mood swings, outbursts, occasional anxiety, and I cry very very easily.

This was the first BC I had ever taken so the hormones was something I was not used to but did adjust to, I noticed I was more emotional and would get upset about things more than ever but eventually that passed but I did have more energy. I didn’t really gain weight but I did notice that I would eat more than usual. As far as acne I would get a pimple here and there but never bad breakouts. Junel did help decrease the pain in my cramps, it never shortened my period but it did make it lighter. It caused my boobs to always be tender all the time, it also decreased my libido. Overall I don't hate Junel it just didn’t really work out for me. The only reason I am being taken off of Junel is because of the breakthrough bleeding and was advised that isn’t normal for that to happen so often.",L

I was having 2-3 periods a month and my whole body itched. So I switched to Lo Lo per my Dr. I’m halfway through the first pack and yes there have been some side effects. My sex drive has not changed at all. No acne. No migraines thus far. No breakthrough bleeding. However there have been like two days where I was majorly depressed but that was while I was on my period so could have been hormone related. As of now I haven’t had any more depression. Don’t listen to the bad reviews. People who review it badly, well it just wasn’t for them. Just like Sprintec wasn’t for me at all.

I loved Lo Lo and barely experienced any side effects on that so I was heartbroken to have to switch. Had pretty much every symptom in the book within the first month of Microgestin... acne flared up, EXTREMELY bloaty and gassy- felt like it took forever for food to digest, also felt like I had an extra layer of fat/water retention in my abdomen area, and omg the mood swings!! Awful...  I was beyond irritable and wanted to cry all the time. Had really bad cramping the first couple weeks too... like cramping comparable to PMS. This is a pretty big jump in hormone dosage compared to what I’m used to and I don’t think I’ll be taking another month of this, it’s not worth it in my opinion, even short term.

My appetite has decreased dramatically, and some days I barely eat at all. I feel like I’ve definitely lost some weight due to that and I’m terrified of it getting worse because I’m trying to actually gain some weight right now. I randomly get headaches and some small cramps, but nothing too bad. I would say the worst part about all of this is the anxiety and mood swings I’ve had. I already have anxiety, but since taking this birth control it’s gotten much worse. I will say though it is HIGHLY effective at preventing pregnancy.",Eckam93

I figured that it was just the result of dehydration and stress but in retrospect I should’ve considered that my birth control may have been the cause. 3rd month I felt anxious, extremely depressed & hopeless, and had no appetite. I had times of disassociation which was frankly terrifying. This is not like me.Towards the end of my 3rd month I decided to stop taking birth control. I am four days off of it and have started to feel a bit better. My doctor told me that these symptoms stem from birth control. I suggest considering different options if you have a history of mental health issues. I know everyone’s body reacts differently so this is just my experience.

But even my education couldn’t prepare me for the months of HORROR I experienced. I had sore nipples but knew it was my body adjusting to the increased estrogen so I tolerated it, what I didn’t expect was this empty feeling unlike anything I’ve ever felt. Also I felt irrational rage and my mood was explosive. I felt like I was going crazy, little things would irritate me and I would be emotional rather than cope. I thought it’s stress from medical school, but I’ve always had stress and dealt with. Prior to Junel I was on Microgestin for 10+ years. I stopped Junel a month ago, I am back to feeling like myself. Junel is so dangerous..I am a happy easy going person with a lot going on for me in life but it made me feel so worthless and at those darkest moments even suicidal please avoid.

However, my gyno talked me in to trying Taytulla. I was so nervous to try it, especially after reading some of these reviews, but honestly I am so glad I did. I just finished the first month and so far the only side effect I've noticed is an increase in appetite. That's it! No nausea, mood changes, headaches, or anything like that. There was one day with some random, very minimal spotting. Right now I'm on my first period since starting Taytulla and it is drastically a lighter flow, which is really nice. Another perk I've noticed is clearer skin. It has only been one month, so I really hope things continue this way and no worse side effects present themselves.

After I miscarried around 10 weeks, I went to him because the post-pregnancy hormones combined with my tricyclic birth control was exacerbating my PMDD to the point of suicidal ideation for 2 weeks/month. Larin is a good option, he said, because the dose of estrogen stays consistent, unlike the tricyclic. He also advised that Larin is a fantastic BC option for athletes (I no longer play sports but I’m in the gym 4-6 days a week). Turned out he was absolute correct - I started only having periods every few months and now I’ve not had one in about 8 months. I love it. It also dialled PMDD waaaay back, obviously.

I also got in this pill because I had BAD acne, and this pill cleared it up tremendously. It took about 3 packs of the pill for me to see a huge improvement. And once it did, it was just going up from there. I recently got off it because I did mess up on it and I started bleeding on my active pills and I started breaking out again so I had to switch.

Comments on how even if you’re having side effects like bad periods, migraines, weight gain, anxiety, or depression that you haven’t been on it long enough to tell, need to stop. It absolutely isn’t ok to invalidate someone’s experience because they didn’t go through the 3 months of hell that is somehow a standard. If you’re having these side effects, they aren’t ok and your body is trying to clue you in. I was on birth control for 5 years, lolo for over half of that. I thought the good luck on not having your life ruined! mentality was ok. Then the anxiety, depression, and ER visits hit. Nearly a year of my life was gone. It landed me on Prozac temporarily. I’ve never had mental health issues before in my life. I’m 5 months off the pill and am now feeling more like myself. My message is this: listen to your body.

I had no choice really. I had a severely painful ovarian cyst pop after sex (not my first time) and I decided it was enough of going to the hospital and suffering. I started this pill a week ago and I’ll update as much as I can .. so far I had some foggy days in the beginning and felt pretty weird but then it went away and the nausea has been on and off (which they say is normal) I do drink a lot of herbal tea already so that has probably been helping it (peppermint/etc) and now my only complaints are this random brown discharge today(first time kinda) and itchy/burning bumps/pimples that keep popping up everywhere the past few days. I do have sensitive skin already but I hope I get used to this pill. I am on the second week! Will report back soon,Piper
1132,Junel,Birth Control,1.0,,"January 13, 2020",0,Loestrin 21 1/20 (ethinyl estradiol / norethindrone):The devil in disguiseI never experienced anxiety problems before taking this joke of a pill and soon I found myself taking sick days because of extreme panic attacks. It caused very unpredictable mood swings. Made me very irritable and irrational. My boyfriend even compared my behaviour to the jokers-had the highest highs and the lowest lows. The way it made me act was scary to me and those around me. I felt possessed and I had no control over my emotions. I'm usually a chill person and this pill made me angry and upset at things which I wouldn't typically bat an eyelid at.  The first month was actually ok and I thought it would stay that way. It got much worse after a month. Was lead to believe symptoms would improve after 3 months but they only continued to get more and more severe. Worst 4 months of my life taking this pill. Writing this to prevent another woman experiencing what I did- I wouldn't wish this experience on my worst enemy. AVOID AT ALL COSTS.,Ellie

Everyone has a different experience on birth control because hormones affects everyone’s body differently. What works for you might not work for someone else, considering we all metabolize drugs differently, which can be attributed to genetics . I was first on Junel Fe and switched to Nexplanon because I didn’t want to remember to take a pill, and Nexplanon was awful. Now I’m back on Junel Fe as of a week ago and when I was on it before I was on Nexplanon, it was amazing. No pregnancy, regular periods, no side effects. But that’s because I reacted well to Junel Fe and not Nexplanon. But I’m not going to tell people not to go on Nexplanon ever, because as I said, EVERYONES BODY REACTS DIFFERENTLY.

I am hungry all of the time..even after eating a whole meal. Since I don't receive a period maybe my body is tricked into believing its already pregnant...hence my increased appetite.

In the nine days I was able to stand taking this BC, I dealt with all the usual - sore chest, constipation, bloated belly, weight gain, & heightened sadness with no external cause.  This is all to be expected & may have worked itself out over time. However, the scariest side effect by day two was excruciating pain that over the course of at the least the next two weeks traveled from my shoulder, to my neck, to mid back, to my lower left back, to my groin, & settled into my mid lower back.  I was in excruciating pain at times & was not able to drive for fear I would pass out. Needless to say, I missed work time & it significantly impacted the holiday season for me & my family in a very negative way.  I was afraid I would not be able to walk normally again. After a week off this medication, I am only in moderate pain & can walk & drive, but in pain.  At least I know I am not going become disabled.  This experience was truly horrifying.",Anonymous

Worst of all, it’s made me retain a lot of water weight to the point where I am drinking more water than I have in the past and my urine is still fairly dark in the morning. My hands feel swollen when I wake up in the morning from the water weight and my clothes are not fitting on my legs/lower half anymore. People have told me my legs look swollen from the water weight. I have half a pack left and I am considering stopping it even before then because the affects are bad.

This is my first time on birth control (I’m 26 years old). I wanted to get on birth control for many reasons, but the main for horrific periods. A gyno recommended starting LoLo, a low hormone dosage. I had concerns for birth control but two months in and I can say that I’m happy with it so far! Surprisingly nothing has changed in regards to the negative effects. Like you most likely already know, LoLo will probably have you skip your period all together. For me, true.

I’ve taken birth control before and I remember my first pill was pretty high in dosage and made me crazy. I vowed I’d NEVER go back on birth control. However, I decided to give it another go 2 years later. My doctor prescribed me Junel & honestly I luv it. I remember looking up this brand and became instantly terrified. I won’t lie the first 30 days of this pill were bad. I was so nauseas, had breast pain, bloated, any symptom you can get, I got intensely. But after the 1st month all my symptoms were gone. My period has never been skipped due to the pill. It comes the 3rd Friday of every month like clock work. (which was amazing since I’ve always had an irregular period) my periods are light-med and last 2-3 days. This pill is amazing. I haven’t gained weight from the pill, haven’t missed a period or had crazy mood swings. I was so scared to go on this pill but I’m truly glad I did.

Noticed my mood was all around better when I stopped it when we ended. I would start it again when I would start dating people again just to be safe. I realized my mood was unstable specifically I was on the pill, it wasn’t the boy or the relationship. I am a naturally chill person and it made me very sensitive and overreactive to things I normally would just brush off. It did an excellent job of preventing pregnancy though- this is the only form of birth control my partner and I ever used. After a while I noticed that no matter how much I exercised or dieted there was always that little bit of fat on my lower stomach that I couldn’t get rid of.

My doc asked what I was on before I got pregnant which was Taytulla. After my 6 week check up and then 2 week follow up, I asked for a strong birth control since I wasn’t breast feeding anymore. She prescribed me Junel Fe without my knowledge (thought I was getting Taytulla again) which is supposed to be generic for taytulla too, it is supposedly the same strength hormones just for 21 days instead of Taytulla 24 days? It took a week before I began to get hives on my thighs, back, butt, pretty much everywhere. I also experienced a dry itchy vagina! I thought maybe my laundry or body soap was the cause so I switched to sensitive skin stuff. Nope still continued to get hives and itch that’s when it finally dawned on me that I was fine before I started taking this pill.

Basically I feel like doctors often don’t talk about the mental side effects of birth control pills a lot. So if you are ever depressed and think it’s that, don’t let anyone talk you out of switching! But everyone’s body is different so it might work for you.

I started an antidepressant 2 months before I started my BC, so I was having some trouble telling the side affects of the two medicines apart. With Blisovi, my first two periods came at weird times as my body was adjusting to the pill, but I haven't gotten a period at all for the last two months (I took a test, I'm not pregnant). I haven't experienced any back pain or headaches at all. However, my mental state has definitely changed over these past 4 months, but I'm unsure how much of that has been caused by the pill. I haven't had any acne problems. All in all I don't THINK it has caused me any problems-wanted to post this in case any one else was feeling the same way.",Gumball

I also have had clear skin before but for some reason after 9 months on it my skin has been consistently breaking out so I just stopped taking it. I have endometriosis and it did stop my cramps from being super painful but my period was all over the place and the acne won't go away. Only pros were that it did prevent pregnancy and no weight gain but I'm sad this did not end up working out for me. The acne was my main issue I just want the breakouts to stop.

The first two weeks I gained 7 pounds, had horrible acne, and was so tired. I knew my body was going through a hormonal change so I decided to ride out the first month. By the end of the first month I developed extreme, crippling anxiety and depression. Nothing brought me joy, I panicked about everything, I cried for no reason, and had no motivation to do anything. I’d even wake up 5-6 times a night in extreme panics about nothing. This pill honestly almost ruined my life. I just finished my first month and I am never taking it again. I can’t risk how much worse it could get if I stayed on this pill any longer.

For the record, I have never had acne, not even in my pre-teen/teen years. I'd get one or two maybe every few months but that was it. The acne got worse and worse, but I thought if I stuck with Junel Fe my skin would even out. Maybe I just needed to get used to it? Three months later, every inch of my face is covered with swollen, itchy, PAINFUL acne. I can't even rub my eyes without wincing in pain. I was on the phone with my doctor and my pharmacy for over an hour this morning BEGGING to be given literally anything but Junel Fe for my next month of pills.

I’m pretty sure it also caused me to gain weight since I weighed around 130-140 and now I weigh around 160. Also barely ever get my period during the placebo/ off week which also drives me insane considering I have a tendency to freak out. Also it has made me feel super nauseous the last couple of months and my boobs are tender a lot which again FREAKS ME OUT.

I have rarely felt something so emotionally exhausting. My depression was severely aggravated, giving me super dark thoughts and nightmares. I had never experienced that before. I was miserable.

This pill has ruined my life. I thought it was stabilizing my mood, it actually increased my anxiety and made me have no emotion towards anything! After my 3 month trial my pharmacy switched me to the generic form of this pill. This switch made me realize that my anxiety was out of control. I’d cry at the drop of a dime. Over nothing. Paranoid. Nervous. Awful. I was switched back to the microgestin and the anxiety persisted. Skipped 3 periods so far. Constant migraines. It’s been one of the worst experiences I’ve ever had.

So the bleeding and spotting is my only complaint and also slight acne but I'm hoping if I eat healthier the acne will go away and its really not that bad compared to other girls that I've seen on different brands of BC. I love the fact that this is the lowest dose BC on the market because I was terrified of putting hormones in my body.

My mood swings and anxiety levels have been unrealistically bad. I’m a happy and outgoing person so this was extremely hard. Bloating and weight gain have made an appearance... I workout multiple times a week and it really has done a number on my self image and mental health. I have decided not to start another pack. I’m going to let my body reset and heal for a month or two before considering other birth control options...,Bambi

Since being on Kariva & having headaches, nausea, weight gain, acne, I really appreciate Alyacen! In terms of weight, I actually lost 15 lbs the first year I was on it. At that time I was really active with working out & weight lifting. My menstrual migraines & acne went away. My moods & sex drive didn't change & it did help hair growth on my face. Hereditary - random chin hairs, booo. I do recommend it, it worked great for me personally. On Kariva for a few months I have gained weight but not sure it's due to lifestyle or the pill. I do know that on Alyacen I had no probs losing weight. I'd love to switch back to but my new GYN wanted me to try Kariva first.",mm1988

Eventually I started having panic attacks before work ( ER nurse). My midwife wanted to put me on anxiety medication and I didn't like that. Instead I impulsively quit my job that I worked so hard to get. I've always been an anxious person but never this bad. Looking back I think it's all related to the birth control. I exercise daily and eat pretty healthy and still have about a 3lb weight fluctuation throughout my cycle with awful bloating. It's bad enough that for 1-2 weeks throughout my cycle I have to wear a size bigger in my pants. The mood swings are awful. I tend to be level headed but now catch myself feeling grumpy about things that normally wouldn't bother me.

Most people are usually only motivated to post a review when having a bad experience with a birth control, people who are satisfied, usually do not share their experience. However, I've been taking this for about a year now, and it has controlled my PMS by like 95% and has lightened my period almost completely. I have acne-prone skin, and iIcan confidently tell you that my face, as well as my friend's skin, has completely cleared up after a month of using this BC. Experience may definitely vary between people, but my friend who uses blisovi fe 1/20 has such a positive experience and recommended it to me, and I can say the same. I have not seen any noticeable weight gain or weight loss. Give it a try for at least 2-3 months before trying something else! It takes a month or so for your body to get used to the hormonal changes, and may not experience full benefits until then.",yssac

I’ve been on this Junel Fe 1/20 for about 1 and a half weeks now and the changes I’ve seen in my weight are not pleasing to me. I weighed about 134 pounds when I started the pill and now I weight 143. I’ve haven’t seen much change in my acne but I have noticed that all of my psychological feelings for significant other have instantly gone away. So weird and I will probably stop taking this pill. Junel, unlike other stronger birth controls, does not make me sick or nauseous. Surprisingly, this pill has actually made me a happier person but I am not happy with my physical results.

As for birth control it was reliable; I never experienced cramps or spotting, my periods came on time and lasted a manageable 4 days. I wasn't great at taking it on time and sometimes if I was too off I would get a bad stomach ache but that would be my fault. I did get 2 yeast infections when I hit 6 months but I have little to no idea the cause. My ferritin levels for iron deficiency reached a normal level within 4 months which was great - definitely the reduced bleeding helped. I definitely gained weight while on it but I was underweight beforehand and also started university this year.

Junel completely took away my period, which at first I was happy about, but now I just don't feel it's right especially because it's one of the first indicators if you become pregnant. Secondly, I've come to realize that I've been acting completely crazy and emotional about almost everything and my boyfriend can attest to the fact that I was pretty cool and generally laid back right up until I started taking the pill.

Some side effects that I’ve experienced is an incredible drop in my sex drive, and also a very noticeable appetite difference. I hardly have an appetite for any food ever. I also notice light nausea in the mornings. I had normal periods the first 2 or 3 months, but this last period I had barely came at all, and it was just slight brown discharge for like 4 days. This freaked me out since it hadn’t changed my period before, but my doctor did say it takes a few months for your body to sort itself out after you start birth control.

It has stopped those cysts from forming, and my periods and cramping are much lighter than before.

She said all of her patients love it and I would too. In one week, I woke up from a panic attack that was so severe I thought I was having a heart attack. My anxiety was so easily triggered while on this, I had heart palpitations and weird breathing even if I thought of something mildly uncomfortable. My gyno said birth control pill don’t cause anxiety and that me and all of the people who said they had issues on internet are wrong, since no one I've ever given it to has had any issues. She said all progesterones are the same and that nothing would be different unless I control my anxiety because *that* was the problem. I got a 2nd opinion today and was told that the progesterone in Blisovi is different than Orthotricyclen Lo and that people react differently to each type of hormone.

I took it for PCOS, to regulate my heavy/irregular periods,& because I became sexually active (didn’t get pregnant) I’ve taken it for 3 months & will be switching to a different one due to the pill not providing enough estrogen for me. I experienced every side effect but it took away my breakouts, my PCOS pains, & my cramps. It made my breasts fuller/larger (not gonna complain!) The most side effects I had were headaches & nausea (eat before taking or with the pill) I did feel spacey like I wasn’t 100% there. I didn’t feel suicidal/depressed but my anxiety would spike randomly. My doctor is switching me off of Junel because it made my uterus too thin causing me to spot through the active pills/no period through the placebos. My breasts also became too sensitive. The first 3 months will be hard due to adjustments your body needs to make but it took away my PCOS pains. Even though it didn’t work out for me I would recommend this to someone else.",Hi

So, when I read these reviews before taking the pill I legit thought I was either 1) going to lose my mind, 2) have no sex drive 3) gain tons of weight. And that was scary in itself. But, I have always suffered from irregular periods and I had to get them under control. I am into my second month on this pill and I absolutely love it! No mood swings (other than the normal week before period) no depression, no extra anxiety, no weight gain and my periods were WAY lighter and barely any cramping and lasted 4 days instead of 7.

The absolute worst part was that I had clear skin before using Junel and now I have acne all over my forehead, which is lessened noticeably during the week with no hormones. I thought this would go away but it never did. About 1.5 years in, all the symptoms of cramps and heavy flow and nausea came back.

By 8:30am they came to us with her CT results.  She had a 3cm tumor on the motor skills portion of her brain which all the doctors here in Tennessee said was inoperable.  The only change in her medications and environmental factors was the introduction of Taytulla. Leading up to her diagnosis she suffered terrible mood swings, anxiety attacks and night sweats. After further investigation of this medication you can see that 3.3 out of 100000 developed some type of liver tumor.

This has helped clean up my acne, its helped regulate my period and I'm not pregnant, thats why I'm giving it a 2. I'm also giving it a 2 because this BC has turned my into a maniac. Sorry if that sounds bad to anyone but seriously, my emotional state has just gone off the railings. I literally cry EVERYDAY. A lot of the time its for no reason. I've been getting really upset with my boyfriend over nothing half the time. I'm over-dramatic, impulsive, irrational. I'm surprised my boyfriend hasn't dumped me yet. Last night I had a bad episode and he told me he KNOWS it this birth control and that I have to stop taking it because its affecting my mental health and our relationship. When I say I cry everyday, I'm not joking. Guys please stay away from this pill, all I wanted was to regulate my period, not become a psycho.",GBaby
2102,Junel,Birth Control,1.0,,"January 23, 2019",8,"Taytulla (ethinyl estradiol / norethindrone):My doctor switched me to Taytulla after being in Loestrin for nearly ten years. He claimed he was switching me so that I would have an even lower dose of hormones since I had been on birth control for a long period of time. I wasn’t really happy about switching.  Well fast forward only four months later and I was in the ER with severe chest pains, blood pressure of 190/130 and a pulse of over a 170 BPM.  After a CT scan it was determined I had a pulmonary embolism. A very large one found in my left lung, along with many small ones found in both lungs.  All of my doctors have narrowed the cause down to birth control. I never had a single issue with taking Loestrin and only four months after switching have a PE. I don’t think it was a coincidence that it happened after switching to Taytulla. Please me cautious and advocate for yourself if you know something is not normal.",jen

I gained 10 pounds even though I was eating healthy and exercising and I was always bloated! I had brain fog all day and was constantly sleepy! The ONLY plus side to this pill is how clear my skin was. So over all I do not recommend this birth control especially if you  suffer with anxiety.,al

I had extreme moods swings. I was either angry or crying and unable to control it. I had my doctor rewrite me a prescription for minestrin not allowing for the generic.

I was actually put on it for heavy bleeding and I was worried that I would become depressed, gain weight, and gain acne, but none of that is the case. Before taking Lo Loestrin, I had irregular, week long periods with extremely heavy bleeding (to the point where I used 4/5 super tampons a day) and horrible cramps. I have been on the pill for 2.5 months now and absolutely love it. I spotted on and off for the first 2 months, which is normal and tolerable. Other than that, my period has been really light and has not lasted more than 3/4 days. I did experience some nausea at the beginning and have perhaps been more emotional than normal. Overall, while there may be mild side effects, they are completely outweighed by how much less miserable my periods have become.

I've found the nausea is much more infrequent now that I'm taking this pill in the evening, but I still have to make sure I'm eating consistently and drinking a lot of water to prevent it, which I should be doing anyway! Only other negative side effect is that my preexisting anxiety can be a bit worse at times, but it's still manageable.

I had nausea and headaches during the first 3 months which is now gone. You are also at risk of side effects if you do not take the pill correctly.

She decided to switch me to microgestin but my pharmacy provided me with blisovi (what my insurance covered). I’ve been on it for about 2 weeks now and I feel so AMAZING that I HAD to write a review. I felt a change right away. All of a sudden I feel like myself again. I’m so much happier and productive. I will probably come back and write a review when my period comes  because I don’t know how that is going to go yet but as of now I’m very happy with this medication",Liz

It has not affected my work and stress level while I'm in school, but my libido has been low.

I'm in my first semester of college and this pill has not made it easier. I am currently dealing with some relationship problems, but I would never typically feel this depressed about anything. I'm so much happier than this. The only good thing I've experienced with this pill is the barely there period. This pill is destroying my happiness and ruining me as a person.

My doctor prescribed it to me because my flow was severely heavy and that coupled with my anemia led to me passing out a lot. Also before I began it I had cramps so painful that I would miss work or school because I couldn't get out of the fetal position. The first thing I noticed when I originally went on it was the cramps went away. After 4 months of being on it my period it started to lessen. After the first year I went from 5 days of heavy flow and 2 days average flow to 3 days heavy flow and then it lessened over the course of the week. Now I have 3 days of normal flow and light spotting the rest of the week. I never gained weight or had any anxiety attacks. Honestly his pill is great.,Fe

The depression got so bad that I asked my doctor to switch to a lower dose, and Junel's been working just fine. I think I have been on it for 5-6 months now, and I do still have depressive episodes but I also had them before getting on any hormonal medication, so it's hard to say whether or not Junel causes/worsens it.

Before starting this birth control I was already an anxious/stressed person, over the course of taking this I have become so much more anxious/stressed to the point where I start shaking, crying, and get extremely cold.  If you’re an anxious /stressed person I don’t suggest you take this, it will increase those feelings and if you’re sextually active you won’t always get your period causing you to worry.",180NSD
2464,Junel,Birth Control,1.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"August 24, 2018",0,"Junel Fe 1.5/30 (ethinyl estradiol / norethindrone):I never in my life had a negative experience from a birth control pill until I switched to Junel Fe. I was extremely irritable to both my husband and my two year old. I lost crazy amounts of hair. My hunger sky rocketed and I would raid the fridge as soon as I got home from work. I was angry all the time on this pill. The only plus to this pill is that I did not have acne break outs, my skin was clear. But the amount of anxiety and irritability that comes with this pill is not worth it. It took me awhile to figure out what was causing all these horrible side effects because I never experienced side effects like this. It was so bad that I fear to try another pill.",Ana P
2465,Junel,Birth Control,9.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"August 24, 2018",5,Blisovi 24 Fe (ethinyl estradiol / norethindrone):I was skeptical because of all of the negative side effects but I have not experienced any . This is the best birth control I’ve tried thus far. It stopped the abnormal spotting and heavy/painful periods. It doesn’t make me overly emotional or moody.,Brittany W
2466,Junel,Birth Control,9.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"August 24, 2018",5,"Blisovi Fe 1/20 (ethinyl estradiol / norethindrone):I have heard a lot of bad reviews so I thought I should share my own review. This birth control has NOT made me depressed or gain weight or make me want to eat more. The only thing I would say is that I spot a lot more but that’s normal in any birth control within the first few months. Also, I get a little more acne than I had before but nothing too serious, and it will probably go away when my body gets used to the new hormones.",K
2467,Junel,Birth Control,4.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"August 23, 2018",2,"Blisovi 24 Fe (ethinyl estradiol / norethindrone):This pill was very effective for me but there were positives and negatives with taking it. The pros were that I hadn’t gained any weight, no nausea, no headaches, and my acne cleared up right away. The cons were that I had a full period for the second week of pills plus 3 days when I should’ve had it. I would cramp a lot as well. It was also causing me to have insomnia most nights. After I continued bleeding for those weeks I stopped taking it but other than that i had no major side effects.",Gia3
2468,Junel,Birth Control,1.0,,"August 23, 2018",6,"Taytulla (ethinyl estradiol / norethindrone):I had been taking Taytulla for almost 2 years. Since previous birth control had given me lots of stomach problems and Taytulla seemed to lessen them although they were still there. I take Taytulla consistently so I do not get a period, this was recommended by my doctor and is completely safe. However within the past 6 months my sex drive has not only been low but I have experienced extreme pain with sex, come to find out the pill was not fully stopping my periods correctly and actually caused me to grow a few cysts that have had complications. Ever since discovering this and really looking into the past few months I have realized  the pill has done nothing but make my life miserable. I have lost hair, had 13 day long break through bleeding, and my depression and anxiety has been the worst it has ever been. Each pill has different effects for everyone but this was my experience and after the recent recall of this product I do not feel it has worked properly.",Anonymous
2469,Junel,Birth Control,9.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"August 23, 2018",4,"Junel Fe 1/20 (ethinyl estradiol / norethindrone):I have been on this pill for about 4 months now. I have seen many negative reviews on it and was concerned, but I have been having a good experience with it. I have gained 10 lbs since on it and a slight increase in discharge/odor. Other than that I have had no problems, so I would say the side effects depend on the person.",Liv
2470,Junel,Birth Control,2.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"August 23, 2018",1,Lo Loestrin Fe (ethinyl estradiol / norethindrone):My gyno switched me to lo lo three months ago. I was on the generic of Aviane and had long irregular periods. She switched me to lo lo to help with that. I immediately stopped having my period and I hate it. It feels unnatural to not have it at all and it always makes me paranoid that I’m pregnant. I have felt VERY moody on Lo Lo. I’m 22 and have had acne since I was probably around 12. Not cystic- just mild sized hormonal bumps on my chin but it’s constant. Aviane had almost entirely cleared up my skin when I went on LoLo and ever since I’ve switched I’ve had HORRIBLE acne. Painful deep ones which I’ve never had much of before. I am switching back to Aviane brand only this time to see if that helps regulate me.,Kiki2920
2471,Junel,Birth Control,10.0,,"August 23, 2018",9,"Blisovi Fe 1/20 (ethinyl estradiol / norethindrone):This is my first time taking any form of birth control. I’ve been on this pill for about 5 days, and I’m feeling fine. The first day, I did experience some slight nausea, but it went away after around ten minutes. I don’t get anymore of it (for now at least)! I haven’t noticed any side effects so far except for my period already starting to be a lot lighter. No acne, mood swings, weight gain, or anything so far. I’ll keep you guys updated next month :)",Trinity
2472,Junel,Birth Control,1.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"August 22, 2018",5,"Blisovi Fe 1.5/30 (ethinyl estradiol / norethindrone):I started taking Microgestin in 2014, and just this year in March I went to pick up another pack and was told they no longer had it, but they gave me a new bc Blisovi and assured me it was exactly the same. Well, it’s not. My anxiety has been at an all time high, as well as my depression. I have gained 15 pounds just from taking this pill from March-August. This pill has made my life awful, I am always so nauseas and irritated. Would not recommend whatsoever.",Kaiiiyuh
2473,Junel,Birth Control,8.0,,"August 22, 2018",5,"Junel Fe 1/20 (ethinyl estradiol / norethindrone):Okay so I am on my first pack of Junel fe 1/20.  I recently switched from Cryselle 28 (horrible pill do not recommend gave me cramps and acne) so I went on Junel fe to help with acne and cramps. So I am on my second week and it did help with my acne I don’t have very many zits anymore so they have decreased so I am happy with that. I am now experiencing spotting, it’s been 3 days of spotting and it’s still going on ! It might be breakthrough bleeding but I’ve never experienced it before so I’m so confused. I’m waiting for it to end. Besides that it didn’t give me horrible problems. I don’t have depression and this pill didn’t make me sad like my last pill did.",apple1542

I woke up this morning at 3 am throwing up and continued to for hours on end. I have changed my prescription already and won't be using this one anymore.,Audrey
