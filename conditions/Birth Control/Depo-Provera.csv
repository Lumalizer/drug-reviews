1,Depo-Provera,Birth Control,1.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"March 16, 2022",0,"Worst decision ever. Took one injection Nov 29, 2021 and I’ve been sick since then!! Been off for 3 weeks now and I’m having stomachache and acid reflux, back and side pain… it’s not worth it one bit!!!",Kimmykb123
2,Depo-Provera,Birth Control,9.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"March 8, 2022",0,"I recently just stopped getting my depo Provera injections this past month. The only reason I have stopped is because I have been advised by my doctor that it is not a good long-term form of birth control due to the fact that it causes a loss in calcium in your bones. I was on the shot for a little over 2 years, and I had little to no side effects. I had almost no period at all the entire time I was on it, besides some spotting a couple days every couple months (which only lasted a couple days) ...I never experienced sudden heavy bleeding like others have mentioned, so I am not sure if there was a change in the injection formula but only some woman's bodies responded to it. Aside from my period, I did have a low sex drive. Overall, I had no extremely negative side effects. None that beat how good it was at preventing pregnancy at least. I had unprotected sex the whole time I was on it! That's a win in my opinion.",Anonymous
3,Depo-Provera,Birth Control,3.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"March 4, 2022",0,"I was on depo for 3 years. It will definitely prevent pregnancy because you will have no desire for sex in the first place. Also, I bled for months straight constantly.  As soon as I got off my sex drive came back, not as strong as it was before but it’s back. It was only a plus because it was every 3 months.",Don't recommend

5,Depo-Provera,Birth Control,1.0,,"February 21, 2022",0,"My experience on the depo-provera injection was truly a nightmare. It made me moody and cry everyday. Sex became unbearably painful, no matter how much lube we used. One of the worst parts of it was that it made my hair fall out! I’ve been off of it for over 6 months and am still waiting for my hair to grow back, and I hope it does. Never again! This stuff ruined my life!",Mewkiki79
6,Depo-Provera,Birth Control,4.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"February 18, 2022",0,"It worked- I never did get pregnant while using this birth control, however, I would go two months without a period, the get a period for a month while actively using it. After I got my tubes tied, I stopped taking it, and my periods were semi normal. Cramping was worse, starting two weeks prior to every period, and akin to labor, accompanied by a whopping 20 lbs of water weight during my period. My cycles were 38 days at the time. I was actively trying to lose weight, ate healthy, got exercise, didn't shed a pound, and instead gained. My thyroid hormones were way off. A year out, I'm finally back to my normal cycle length, shedding pounds like I'm trying to, bloating a typical amount for me (half, at 10lbs), cramping and mood swings have reduced, and all of my hormones are finally back to normal with no medication, change of lifestyle, or any treatment whatsoever. You might not get pregnant, but it'll be at a cost. No, I have not changed anything else in my life.",Mrsmom444
7,Depo-Provera,Birth Control,,,"February 1, 2022",0,I was one of the first people to trial this contraception. I was on it for 10 years. I found it very good for a while my periods stop completely. Which I liked no more sanitary towels days..but then I was taken off because my ostrone level were very low and they were worried it would cause arthritis in my later days.  I enjoyed been on it but the problems I had after coming off were not good. Very heavy periods anemia.,Linda

This January I was supposed to get another injection but I switched to the pill. The whole year I experienced bleeding every day…. EVERY day. Less than a normal period but more than spotting. I asked doctors multiple times if this was normal and they told me yes every time, nothing to worry about. I also realized my hair was falling out, didn’t alarm me at first because I have thick and long hair. I realized my hair was falling out and not growing back! Yay birth control. These are very rare side effects but it happened to me. My skin looks good, didn’t gain weight.",Anonymous
9,Depo-Provera,Birth Control,2.0,,"November 23, 2021",0,"Every body is different when it comes to birth control and it can take a while to find which one is right for you. Sharing a little bit of my experience with the depo shot might help someone out there in making their decision. I’ve gone through almost every birth control out there and am still struggling to find one that works for me. I was only on the depo shot for 3 months. During those 3 months I was okay nothing seemed off or out of the ordinary. I’ve struggled with acne for about 3 years now and my main reason for going on birth control was to help with my skin. If I could take back one thing I would have never done the shot. I've been off of it for around 3 months now and my skin has gotten severe, painful and my confidence has completely vanished. I read a couple other reviews about the shot and some of them did mention their skin got really bad. It happened immediately after I got off of it, and it’s been very hard to get back to where I was before I tried the shot.",Anonymous

The first time, a week after I received the injection, I woke up in the middle of the night with mild waves of nausea. Got the injection next time and again a week later, woke up in the middle of the night with waves of nausea but this time I was profusely sweating and was physically weak and couldn’t make it back to bed so I had to lay on the bathroom floor for 10 minutes till it all passed.

11,Depo-Provera,Birth Control,1.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"November 19, 2021",1,"I have read other womens experiences on this drug obsessively to give me comfort with sensing when I may feel more like myself. So here is my experience coming off. This drug is said to last 12 weeks, approximately 15 weeks for it to no longer be detectable in your system. Prior to this I was on monofeme for approximately 8 months. No issues with the pill except when forgetting to take it. Limited space, you know the bad side effects so here's the withdrawal. All symptoms started to slowly ease up bit by bit. From week 5 I recorded improvements weekly. Most feeling I'm returning to my self around the 9 week mark. It's been 14 weeks and thinking clearer, joking and laughing again, mood/anxiety n energy improved but libido not fully, at least I can get wet and enjoy sex but it's not the same and masturbating feels impossible to start. Light period. Now for hormones to balance naturally w ginseng, primrose oil, and ashwaghanda daily. Cruciferous veg help w hormones too. Exercise/running also",Lilith
12,Depo-Provera,Birth Control,1.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"November 19, 2021",1,"This is one of the worst things I have ever experienced in my life. I had one injection.Fatigue so strong I felt like I was dying, bed ridden many days during the peak. Brain fog had me apathetic and extremely dissociated, unable to converse and could not feel in touch with the world around me. Mood swings very intense, at the peak cried at anything and felt extreme irritability. Libido completely gone, aside from debilitating psychological symptoms interrupting sexual desire I was physically unable to become aroused, my vagina was dry generally, and mentally it was impossible to have contact with what may usually influence arousal. So I was suffering and also had no ability to do what could help improve my state of wellbeing, there was a similar sensation to the loss of libido/external factors being ""far away"" in not being able to ""feel"" or be moved by music. Absolutely terrifying. THIS SHOULD NOT BE LEGAL",Lilith
13,Depo-Provera,Birth Control,1.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"November 4, 2021",0,"I got the Depo Shot just over 3 months ago. It was suggested to me by my Doctor because I had developed a stomach ulcer from the dangerous amount of Nurofen I used to take during my periods.I was super hesitant and I was battling with the decision for at least 2 weeks before my Partner just told me to do it. When I went to go get the needle, I needed to do a Pregnancy test first. I couldn't pee for well over 2 hours...... Maybe that was my body telling me to just give up, go home and not get it. I wish I listened!AS SOON as I got the injection, I immediately just felt off..... About a month in, I noticed that I was getting chronic constipation, which lead to pain, bloating and cramps. I constantly have a false urge to go to the toilet (Both number 1 and number 2) I developed urinary retention. I couldn't pee without physically pushing it out. I cannot do a number 2 unless I take laxatives daily. I NEVER suffered from any of this prior to the shot. It has ruined my  life.",Dee
14,Depo-Provera,Birth Control,3.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"October 26, 2021",2,"I started getting Depo Provera freshman year of college because I was looking for a form of birth control where I didn’t have to rely on myself for protection, i.e the pill. I had never tried BC before. The doctor recommended me the injection & I agreed that it was worth a try being that it seemed super easy just to get a injection in my butt every 3 months and have it be super protective. But I was dumb and did not do any outside research on my own to be sure that it would be right for me. You still do not know until you try, but now I know that the injection is a method I would NEVER get again! It took me months to realize that it was causing me severe depression to the point of me feeling suicidal. I remember being on the phone with my boyfriend crying on the floor saying I don’t know what’s wrong with me?! I am not prone to depression nor had I ever really dealt with it prior. After a few months of having no period, but mood swings and depression. It messed me up! I do not recommend.",Jsabs

I know everyone reacts different to a drug but trust me when I say stay away from this.  I got only one injection that lasts three months but that was enough to destroy my mental health.  It was horrible, made me gain 10 pounds in just  three months give me the worse depression and anxiety of my life. Two years later and still no recovery my doctor had to put me on antidepressant.

When I first started it no bleeding at all for a whole month than the next month after it started to bleed like crazy it was annoying and it worried me too, till doctor said that is okay and it normal and some woman will bleed a full year till it fully stops and then no more bleeding. It has been a year now but still seeing some bleeding and I hope it stops but I was told once you reach two years  that you should come off of it or it will be hard to get pregnant.  I was told that this method is more used for woman on menopause which is probably  why they suggest us to only be on it for two years and done. I was also told it will take a while too see your period again after stopping the injection which idc - I don’t like my periods but the bleeding was pretty annoying",Lele

I was told by my provider since I smoked I must use this birth control versus pill form (I had been on the lowest dose BC since 16). I got the first injection, not a problem, got the second injection and I started to feel odd.  All of my family and friends kept telling me how swollen I looked.  Never thought much of it, although I felt funky. LVN Nurse Mother said, you need to go to a Dr outside your provider, you are having a reaction.  Never got my monthly period the entire time, not pregnant either. Went to an outside OBGYN and he also noticed how bloated I appeared.  He gave me some hormone pills to try to get my period back, 9 months later, tons of meds I finally felt better and got my period.  I had no idea how horrible I looked and felt at 35 until I finally got my period after 15 months.  That OBGYN said he had seen many gals having this issue.

25,Depo-Provera,Birth Control,1.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"July 25, 2021",1,This stuff ruined my life. No one told me it would permanently change my periods and hormones even years after the last dose. I was on this stuff for 2.5 years. When I was taken off of it I was told I should've never been given it longer than 2 years it can cause permanent bone loss.But the worst part is the periods. Before I had 3 day no cramp periods. Half the time I'd forget I was bleeding. Now I have to wear diapers and change them every hour. They come randomly too. Sometimes it'll be months with no period. Then sometimes it's 2 weeks apart. It's debilitating. I can't leave my home because walking causes gushes and massive clots to come out. I've been to the ER and many drs. They are all very dismissive but bleeding so much isn't normal.

Insomnia for weeks on end. Raging emotions, sad and crying one minute, angry and shouting the next. Hot flashes, blurry vision, throbbing headaches and joint pain. I was not told any side effects in the clinic only that it stops periods and lessens cramps. I wish I was given a leaflet to make an informed decision. 7 months later and I'm loosing weight slowly, sleeping better and had been having sex occasional but it's a bloody mess and hit and miss if I climax at all. I just want the period to end. I would recommend ginseng as a mood booster and evening primrose oil to regulate your hormones. These brought back my libido a bit and made me less suicidal.

The GP told me it would take my body about 6 months to get back to normal.I remember that 3 months after stopping the injection I started my period which lasted a month, and eventually I had to go to A&E because it was getting worse, and I was very weak. It will be 4 years since I stopped the injections this year and my estrogen is constantly low since, to the point where my GP is worried that I may start menopause early. My periods are late.

I wash my face with acne wash, exfoliate, and moisturize with a gel moisturizer specially for acne and it does nothing. My hair has also always been on the fine side but after getting the Depo I'm noticing way more of my hair coming out in the shower than usual. I will not be getting another. It does it's job in preventing pregnancy and not having a period is nice but the negatives outweigh the two positives for me.",Bunny

I was on and off different kinds of pills for years before & they all made my blood pressure high, then I would get headaches & be sick to my stomach. It was an awful cycle so depo has been a blessing for me. I stopped having periods since I took the first injection..& haven’t had any periods or bleeding since. I haven’t experienced any mood swings( if anything I’ve noticed my anxiety has dropped), my acne noticeably better. I will sometimes have very very light cramping about a week before I get my next injection, & have noticed having random night sweats. I do take a calcium supplement every day just because I am paranoid about the bone density loss, but my doctor does not seem very concerned about it. I make sure I get my injections exactly 12 weeks apart. I’ve had no changes in sex drive and no weight gain.",PMgirl94

45,Depo-Provera,Birth Control,1.0,,"March 4, 2021",0,"I got the Depo-Provera injection last year in June and bled heavily for six months straight after getting one injection. I also gained 10-15 pounds which should be impossible because I ate less due to me being depressed about the bleeding. Even now my weight hasn't gone down even through exercising and eating healthy. So to the people saying that they didn't gain weight and saying it's the women's fault for eating more not the ionjection, stop commenting that, because the injection does increase your appetite and causes people to eat more, but for me I didn't have to eat more and still gained weight.

I have never felt this way before, and I could tell it was my injection. I also felt like this shot wore off early for me because a week before I was due for another round. I got terrible pain once again and felt as if I was having the worst mood swings of my life.

Shortly after starting Depo my periods went away, I'd say after the second shot they were completely gone. I had spotting very rarely, maybe once or twice a year. It's hard to blame Depo on my weight gain. When I first started it I was 97lb (I'm 5'2) and I stayed around 105-110 the first 3-4 years on it. I'm now at 120lb and have been around 120-125 the past several years.Since bone density loss is a possible side affect I had to get scans every 3 years. The scans showed that I had zero changes in my bone density.My only complaint and reason why i'm getting off of it is my decreased sex drive. I completely lost all motivation and drive and being married that's become an issue.Otherwise, I adore Depo and wish I could stay on it forever.",yaynoperiods

I went on depo and it made me go from 118lbs-150lbs within 3 months. I lost all motivation sleeping 16-18h a day, only getting up for work and working out as I was disgusted by my body. While on it I had some bizarre suicidal ideation that subsided after the 3 months. I only had one injection of depo.It’s been over a year since I was on it and the doctor told me that it’s possible that depo made permanent changes to my metabolism as I have been unable to lose the weight despite rigorous exercise (~12-14h/wk, I am an ex varsity athlete and am no stranger to intense workouts) and if anything a LESSER caloric diet than previous to the depo, and I have been unable to find a medication that is effective at treating my depression.

After the second shot I felt like I wasn't myself then the great depression came it almost split up my relationship I was so up and down, at that point I was bleeding for weeks, I was due for my 3rd shot days ago and I have no intention of getting it.

I thought okay maybe now that I'm in my 30's birth control would be different. I am the same person I was when I was a teenager. Depo and all horomonal birth control cause severe mental health issues for me, my mother put me on birth control as soon as I hit 15. Soon after I was diagnosed and put on various psyche drugs. Took many years to believe in myself and stop listening to drs that horomones don't cause issues that severe. Well they do.

After the weight gain my doctor told me I am at very high risk for heart disease now. I had anxiety attacks daily, & my depression peaked for the long 3 months. My depression continued to be horrible for following months. I have had no luck getting pregnant for the last year since I took it. After the first 3 months, I had an extremely painful period that lasted a month. The depo provera shot literally pumps you full of enough hormones to last for three months. I would not suggest it to anybody. Here I am over a year later, with the worlds slowest metabolism, and I can’t even look at myself in the mirror without seeing all the weight I gained.

My mom and I decided that depo was the best birth control since I’m not too responsible as a 15/16 year old and I wouldn’t have to remember to keep taking birth control every day. Anyways, this has been the worst experience of my life. Depo was ok for the first year. Now I am suddenly experiencing dizziness, breast pain, severe cramps, nausea, etc. My whole body just feels uncomfortable and I am ALWAYS angry or upset. On top of that I am always tired to the point where I can take a three hour nap after school then go to bed at 8 pm that night. It has never been this bad before and it gets better for about a week then it starts all over again. Birth control is different for everyone but I thought I was okay for the first year then it all went down hill.",EP

I exercise and eat pretty healthy so no biggie with the weight. The only down fall I have for using Depo-provera so long is that now it's time for me to make a change in Birth Control or Sterilization.

I never want to have sex anymore and have issues getting wet and aroused with my partner, who is very sexy and I’m very attracted to.he isn’t the problem. I also bleed after we have sex sometimes.

The cramps are so bad that I couldn't walk, it feels like my all the area below my belly button was slowly ripping apart. It has changed me emotionally too. It increased my anxiety and depression and just really dark thoughts. It has changed my personality drastically. I also caused me to passed out twice. And cramps symptoms are usually sweating, shaking, and in a lot of pain. It has caused emotionally and physically pain and risks of life. I DO NOT RECOMMEND THE DEPO SHOT.

I then bled consistently for 5+ months even with no sexual activity. I realized it was likely connected to the shot, which has a reputation for causing irregular bleeding. I stopped it, and now seem to have TONS of acne, which I noticed would pop up if I was a little late getting my shot, but would go away when I got it. I had to go on the pill to stop the bleeding, but stopped the pill too because I was sick of being dependent on these medications, and I’m now waiting to see if the bleeding comes back.

I'm now in my early 40s & my Dr has said I need to stop it. I read some articles about a progesterone & anxiety link coming off Depo. It's called a hormone storm - Depo keeps progesterone high in the body, when Depo leaves your body, large amounts of oestrogen return, and progesterone drops, causing anxiety.

Hence the breast tenderness. I hope that anybody considering this do research on this medication. I wish I would have done more research before I got it. This has totally ruined my life.

171,Depo-Provera,Birth Control,1.0,,"August 12, 2019",2,A couple years ago I was told I couldn't have kids. Every month I'd have to go to the ER because I had a ovarian cyst and my periods were unbearable and someone recommended depo to stop my periods. Bad I mean BAD side effects like dark thought that are soo bad. You will go crazy. You will be depressed. After being on the shot for awhile I decided to get off. 2 months later. Pregnant! I don't even know how! But sadly there is no way for me to get pregnant anymore. Interesting. I actually think depo helped me to be able to have kids? A year later I'm back on the shot.  But I'm not taking it good. My emotions are just plain. Crazy. I feel so bi polar and just crazy. But I don't have any other birth control that I  can take  except the IUD or whatever they are called but they both suck:( anyone with cyst... this is the best for ya... sorry,Amber

Before the depo I would have terrible periods, really painful and very heavy cycles which  would have a big impact on my life especially at school when I couldn’t leave the house. The doctor put me on medication to lighten the flow of my period until I was old enough to start the pill. I decided after my second son that I didn’t want anymore children so I started depo I was told that there are side effects, every quarter my doctor tries to get me off it, I’ve also had a bone density scan done and all was normal. I don’t think I’ve had any side effects and I’m happy to stay with it until menopause but I’ve been reading some horror stories about women coming off this drug and I’m worried.

174,Depo-Provera,Birth Control,6.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"August 3, 2019",1,I was on the depo for almost 4 years. I would rate it higher because it did it's job but I decided to change to patch because it can make you unable to conceive for up to two years. I missed my last shot by two weeks and started having terrible cramping. BTWI did have major loss of sex drive during the use. The cramping went away after getting shot again and I thought maybe switching to patch would make it not happen but I was wrong. Been having terrible cramping which I know is from depo withdrawal and nauseous but hungry all the time that's probably from patch. I looked at other woman's forums since there is no studies on withdrawals and one woman had same cramping for 8 months and went to specialist who said because it thinned her uterine lining so much the pain was from it starting to grow back. The fact that ibuprofen helps makes me think that's really the case. Apparently this drug was created as a contraceptive technique for psych ward patients,Smash
175,Depo-Provera,Birth Control,2.0,,"August 3, 2019",0,A hard NO. I’ve been on this for 6 months and I’ve been in agony the whole time. Positives I loved having all the sex I want without the worry of getting pregnant or using a condom. I was with the same guy and he busted in me every time and no pregnancy. Little cramps. And light periods. Negatives: I passed out twice from my anxiety getting too high. When it’s around the time of the month that I'm suppose to have my period I bleed lightly for a week and a half and then spot brown blood for 3 weeks prior. It stresses me out not knowing when I will stop bleeding. My panties are ruined. mood swings were terrible. Depression got bad. I told my doctor how I was bleeding for up to 2 weeks long she up my dose. Didn’t really change a thing but made me bleed for even longer. I’m due for my next shot early September so I'm  passing on that. They say the bleeding should stop in a year but I hate the feeling of hormones messing with my body.,F2h7

Since I’ve been on it I’ve of course gained weight but I completely relate that to just simply growing. My hair definitely has gotten thinner, and my skin has always been nice and into my junior year of high school till now (freshman in college) I’ve experienced AWFUL acne. I have tried everything for it and I can’t say the Depo was doing anything to make it worse or better- however I do think my skin has worsened because my hormones are completely unbalanced and I definitely think it’s because of Depo! I switched to Aviane yesterday and read some scary reviews about that method as well. KEEP IN MIND: all birth controls have side effects and everyone reacts differently.",Anonymous

Besides the long agonizing period pains and stains I’ve also dealt with eerie mood swings and depression, I’d really feel so much emotions in one day.

A couple of years after I started the Depo I was diagnosed with hypothyroidism but I don't know if using the Depo could have contributed in any way. My sex drive did diminish though.

I do have daily headaches, but I cannot be sure if it is the birth control to blame as I am prone to headaches. On the down side most doctors do not allow this birth control for more than 2 years due to its ability to decay your bones. Overall, great experience! Don't let the bad reviews scare you away and give it a shot! (no pun intended)",eklei050

As far as emotional issues are concerned, I am generally crazy at baseline and do not feel as though Depo has exacerbated my emotional instability at all. Overall this birth control is amazing and I’ll be sad when I have to stop taking it due to bone mineral density loss. If anyone does decide to use this as a contraceptive method, it’s really important to take calcium supplements to preserve your bone density.  As far as sex drive is concerned, I am in a fairly new relationship ( 6 months in) so of course I want to have sex all the time. I’m not sure if this will change once the novelty wears off.",Megan

I don’t recommend having unprotected sex but that’s just how I prefer to do it, and we are in a long term exclusive relationship. It also completely eliminated my painful cramps and I haven’t been getting any period symptoms at all. The cons about this birth control is that you will gain weight.

I do believe I have slipped into depression being that I'm scared to go anywhere. My shot will be ending at the end of this month and I'm literally praying I'm back to my self. This is NOT ME. I have always been a fun, strong minded female, and now I'm too scared to even take my son to the park. This depo shot had mentally & emotionally messed me up. I will be done with all birth controls after the DEPO experience.",Koda

Once in a RARE blue moon I'd get a random ""OW CRAMP"" for a hot 2 seconds then be fine again. No weight gain or worse acne, no change in moods. Only reason switched to the implant was cause my doc (same doc I've had since 16) advised to since my bones already aren't so great,& it's been shown that Depo can(like all medicines ""can"" have adverse reactions) make joint pain & ""bone pain"" more problematic. I'm almost 29 now, have had Nexplanon since the switch (Oct/Nov17') & I'm already wanting to go back to my good ol depo! Now see my cousin on the other hand won't go near depo ever again, says she felt like it ""literally made"" her go/feel crazy.

Pamprin and midol didn’t even help. The second shot gives me IBS symptoms and depression. It’s like certain foods trigger diarrhea and gas and bloating CONSTANTLY.

I was never worried about getting pregnant and I did not see a change in periods- I mostly didn't get them. As time went on I was having difficultly getting wet, which my doctor said was normal. This was part of the reason I decided to get off of it though. I gained a lot of weight at first and its been really hard to lose it. I went from 120 to 145 in about a month with no changes to my diet/exercise. As for mood swings, it is hard to tell if this shot had this side affect for me. I was a teenager graduating high school and going off to college so I already had a lot emotions.  I decided to choose a new one because I was told having this for more than two years is not good for your health. The weight gain and inability to lose weight while on it were also factors.",Em

Around the 5th of the next month I had a period and I assumed it was starting my cycle completely over but the bleeding didn’t stop it just went from a regular period to spotting. Sex drive was completely gone, my appetite changed, I had mood swings (I’m just a moody person naturally) the spotting would stop for 4 or 5 days and come back and last like 2 weeks.

She had only got the first shot and immediately following we decided not to get the next. I would never recommend this to anyone who plans on having children for my wife hasn't had her period since and we are having fears of infertility. She had horrible head aches within the second month of the shot and muscle spasms.  She also lost her sex drive and had major mood swings. She was not herself and she started to gain weight almost immediately. Her body still isn't used to being off of the shot. Be very weary of choosing birth control. We learned our lesson.,Craig daniels

Another minor symptom I had was serious weight gain, luckily that went away almost immediately upon coming off of the shot.

Finally, I was taken off Depo due to possible bone density issues for long-term use (over 2 years), and switched to Yasmin, which cleared my skin up completely!

I'm generally prone to weight gain but didn't experience this at all after starting the shot; I started training for a fitness competition shortly after and was concerned it might be harder for me to cut weight but had no issues whatsoever. It's so much easier than having to take a pill every day and there are some great calendars online that tell you when you're able to go back for the next one and when you're deadline is.

Due to me being on it so long it took two years for my period to return which I didn't mind and I conceived about 4 moths after that.

It's going to be an insane challenge to deal with this for 2 more months.. god help me!!

I've been really sluggish and lethargic but I was already depressed before the depo shot so I can't say if it's related or not. Also I started smoking around the same time so it could just be that. I've had acne since I was 11 and since taking depo its cleared up a bit but don't know if it's from the depo. The only thing that sucks is I'm pretty sure my sex drive has been affected by the shot but it's not a big deal. I missed my last shot because I moved so I'm thinking of switching to the implant because I hate driving 45 mins to the closest PP but depo has worked so well for me I don't know if it's worth switching at this point",kt coastin

I can't sleep through the night at all and I've been having an increase in nightmares that I'm certain is related to the birth control. My dreams were never this bad before.

It disrupts the hormonal balance in your body (which is why you can't get pregnant) but hormones are not something that you should mess with.

Extreme fear, nausea, choking, sweating all out of nowhere. Then it happened again several hours later. I took the shot only once. It's been six months since I received the shot and I'm now having another panic attack. No one actually tells you that the depot shot remains in your system for up to 18 months.This doesn't even come close to the worst of it.A month after my depo shot I started my period. My period went from July to October NONSTOP. Continual flow, every day, for five months. It finally stopped when I ate a bunch of fresh ground flax seeds (they have estrogen in them, which helps repair uterine lining - depo is progesterone which thins the uterine lining).

I started spotting in August - a sign that my body is going back to normal ish. My withdrawal symptoms are starting to suck. Over the last three days I've had nothing but severe cramping, that I can't function with. Today (being the third day) I'm finally experiencing a normal period.

For me, I got my period a week after the shot and I went for about a week, the second month was spotting for almost 3 weeks, the third month was spotting for 2.

If you don't replace your calcium, your bones can become weak or you can experience more side effects. Just take care of yourself :)",MandaDelia

I started the beginning of my junior year in high school because my periods were so bad that I would miss school because of cramping. Just taking regular Tylenol or ibuprofen wouldn't lessen the pain. So we decided to go and see if could try something that would help. And the Depo has been amazing for me. I don't have periods although for the first month and a half I did spot on and off. I do sometimes get small cramps but they are nothing like they were and they're only around the time I should be on.

Such as slight weight gain which I help to control with diet and exercise. Loss of sex drive which my longtime boyfriend is more than happy to help with. And I tend to start spotting around the time that my next shot is due. Once I receive the depo shot, within hours the spotting stops.",Laura R.

But I haven't gained any weight, in fact I've lost 5 pounds but my only concern is my stomach pain, it gives me nausea. I never vomit I only feel like it. It's huge cramping, and sometimes bloating.",Anonymous

I had about a month of spotting when I got my 1st injection, but I have since stopped having periods altogether. It has NOT affected my sex drive. I have gained a little weight, but that could also just be the fact that my metabolism has slowed since I'm getting older.  In the last year I have had a little bone loss and my doctor now wants me to switch to something else. She has suggested Implanon. Wish I could just stay on Depo. ",scarymsmary
954,Depo-Provera,Birth Control,10.0,,"June 21, 2010",5,"I'm getting close to the end of my second year on this birth control. I have to switch because of the bone density thing, but I've taken calcium supplements the whole time so I don't believe my bone density was affected much if at all, but that's just speculation. I did gain a little weight in the last year, but I was also in my freshman year in college, so it may have just been my lifestyle change. After a few months on the shot, I stopped getting periods completely, not even any spotting. This may worry some people, but I got used to it. I have zero complaints for this birth control method overall.",Anonymous

I haven't had any cramps but I do spot for a couple weeks before my shot is due.  I never gained weight, although I should note that I have a very high metabolism.  However, my doctor recently had me do a bone density test and the results were not good.  I'm 25 and my bone density levels were very close to those with osteoporosis.  Studies show this is reversible once you are off the shot, however, the studies are not clear about the long term effects.  So, unfortunately, my doctor no longer wants me on the shot and I am currently looking into another form of birth control.",Anonymous

Only spotted for the first 2 or 3 months then every once in awhile after that. It sucked while it was going on but it was definitely worth it. I haven't had a real period since the day I started, no cramps or any symptoms of that at all. Did gain about 25lbs. Within the first year that was the worst part about it, then I stopped gaining weight but no matter what I can't get the weight off at all. Noticed really bad migraines about 2 years into it. Don't if it has anything to do with it. Doctors don't have any idea why I get them but maybe that's why. Other than that I love it don't have to worry about it except once every 3 months.",Anonymous
