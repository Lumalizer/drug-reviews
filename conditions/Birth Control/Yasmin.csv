1,Yasmin,Birth Control,9.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"March 7, 2022",0,"Took it for about 4 years, before I had the Diane for some years which is similar. Now I’m off it for also 2 years, using a copper IUD. Looking back, the Diane had me more depressed. The Yasmin gave me amazing spotless and vital skin, bigger boobs, nice smooth shiny hair, less peach fuzz on the rest of my body, stable mood, easy periods. The whole last year with the copper IUD has been horrible. In the 2 years without the pill my boobs shrunk incredibly, my sex drive is less, hair is very hard to manage and has a different structure, my skin has a lot of acne and wrinkles and the peach fuzz got a lot worse again. Really considering getting back on the Yasmin.",Monique

3,Yasmin,Birth Control,1.0,Taken for 5 to 10 years,"February 28, 2022",0,"I used this horrible pill for 10 years. It caused me to have horrible mood swings, rage outbursts, changed personality and suicidal thoughts. Last year after having harmed myself I thought I'd quit the pill and turns out the self harm and horrible angry jealous anxious thoughts went away. I'm still a nervous wreck though. I felt like I had no control over my emotions, I was scared I would harm myself, my pets or loved ones. Stay away from this pill, please. Especially if you already suffer from anxiety and depression. Don't wait for the symptoms to go away.",soljavu
4,Yasmin,Birth Control,10.0,Taken for 10 years or more,"February 23, 2022",1,I have been on Yasmin for over 15 years. I have never had any issues other than switching from the Name Brand to the generic. This pill never gave breakouts or adverse reactions. My only issue is that my insurance company refused to cover the cost since it is the Name Brand. I have tried the generic and it is not the same. It produced greater PMS symptoms and also gave me hormonal acne. I am now 33 and considering going off the pill altogether in fear of starting something new. Has anyone else stopped Yasmin? If so could you please share your experience? I am a bit nervous - (not about having a baby) but any side effects from stopping the hormone??,Anonymous

My period came every month like clockwork, I could literally time it to the clock. My periods were 5 days (only Monday thru Friday) and light. I never once experienced any spotting or breakthrough bleeding. I scheduled my life around its perfect predictability. I can count on one hand the number of times I missed a dose. I’ve recently had to stop taking Yasmin for my age and other risks for VTE. I miss it dearly and am at a loss about what to transition to because all other non-estrogen methods do not regulate cycles and are not predictable like Yasmin.",Perfect for me

While I lost 6 kgs weight and had clear skin, on the other hand I lost my sleep and sanity! The most difficult phase was my mental condition after I stopped taking the pill that I had to seek medical help to get out of that condition!

8,Yasmin,Birth Control,1.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"December 31, 2021",0,"I wish I would have read these reviews before I had taken this birth control. I feel like doctors don't warn us enough about the side effects so many women report about this. Then again for profit medicine is just about the bottom line not the welfare of the patients. I lost an alarming amount of hair, I've been religious about rogain to help it come back, I changed my doctor to someone who is helping me get my hormones back to normal, and I recovering from clinical depression that it caused. My hair has just started to come back 8-9 months later. This medication really impacted my life and wellbeing. My story is just one of millions I've found out and not even the worst which scares me and should scare others. I've never felt like a medication should be banned so strongly.

11,Yasmin,Birth Control,7.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"November 21, 2021",0,"Been on this pill for 3 years now. Really really worked. Balanced my appetite, helped me maintain my weight, got a lot of compliments on my skin, and no effects on my mental health compared to Levlen which really messed my mental health and weight up. I went on this pill because all of my close friends suggested that it was good. However, 3 years latter my eyesight started getting worse and I went to the optometrist recently and she told me that combination pills causes your sclera to thin overtime! What! I have to wear glasses now and I used to have 20/20 vision! I constantly have dry eyes and can't fight any allergens or foreign particles with my eyes, have constant itchy eyes and blisters on the skin around my eyes due to constant itching!

It took away the minimal acne I did have. One thing I have been noticing maybe the last couple of years is terrible migraines on the placebo week. Like constant, will not go away with 6 (spread throughout the day) advil/tylenol/excedrin. Because of this I am considering getting off of it and giving my body a break.

13,Yasmin,Birth Control,3.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"November 6, 2021",0,"I have had to go on Yasmin twice in the past few years In 2020 in around January I believe is when I first started taking the pill. the reason I had to go on it was because I had my period for 17 days and when I went to the doctor this was the only option given to me. I was definitely a lot more irritable on the pill and smaller things would make me cry. It worked for what I went on it for though, I had a regular period cycle. Due to things shutting down during covid in around May I wasn't able to get my prescription refilled which I was secretly thankful for because the side effects bothered me a lot. Again in 2021 in April I had my period for a month straight the reason I waited so long to go to a doctor this time was bc I knew they were going to put me on birth control which they did again it worked for what It was prescribed for I am still on it now in November 2021.

Yasmin totally destroyed my brain chemistry/hormone levels, leading to a multitude of crippling changes to my personality, confidence and ability to live.

I was on Yasmin a little over a year and during that time, I started to question all of my relationships. I cried everyday. My hair was falling out and breaking. I felt crazy. My anxiety was through the roof, I didn't sleep and rarely ate, especially because my self esteem became so slow. Now after stopping Yasmin, it has messed up with my fertility. I had normal periods and a normal cycle before going on the pill, all together I was on birth control for 2 years. Now I get a period every 2 and a half months, sometimes shorter, sometimes longer. They vary too, sometimes I'll only spot for a few days and another time I'll bleed for the whole 7. I have been off Yasmin for over a year now and I'm at a loss on what to do. No one will give me solutions except to go back on birth control or start fertility drugs. When did the only solution go to taking drugs ?? Be warned.",Tyxx

Throughout this time I also suffered from vitamin deficiency’s, iron, b12, vitD and as a result I now have Osteopenia (low bone density), I also have stomach inflammation which my naturopath says is a result of taking this pill.  I lost a lot of my hair, have very dry skin, and brittle nails.  I’m no longer taking it, wished I got off it sooner.  Definitely not a pill worth taking for the long term.",44 yr old

Some side effects I get is occasional headaches, I get hungry more frequently (which was a good thing) I have bad eating habits and this made me want food more and I've had no weight gain on this pill.

I got anxiety attacks to the point where I didn't want to walk through or pass a group of people in the supermarket. I cried every single day of my life and became extremely angry. I almost became an atheist, since all I was feeling was this immense darkness and pressure over me. Religion is very important to me, but just didn't see the need for it anymore.

Also brittle nails- they’ve just been snapping off completely so I’ve had to wear plasters because it hurts so much. Had a blood test to see if I’m deficient in anything but of course I’m not.

Maybe it’s because I’m approaching my period, or maybe it’s just the pill. But my breast have been non stop hurting which is unusual for them to hurt more then 1 week. Other then that I have not been into a depression like most people, or feeling too moody. I’m pretty much always in a good mood.

So glad that I'm off this pill now. As for skin, it didn't make my skin significantly better and potentially made it worse by all of the stress that I was experiencing.",lily
46,Yasmin,Birth Control,7.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"April 30, 2021",1,This pill helped my PCOS caused me to gain 8kg and my boobs are way larger. I’m really bloated a lot of the time when I eat any kind of fast food. The first few months on this pill I was quite emotional and bled constantly but this stopped after about 3 months and felt better. I got depressed when I stopped taking a pill for a break (which was advised by my doctor). But it made me so sad and anxious. I would cry every day and think that my boyfriend was cheating on me. I take a pill break to allow a break from the hormones which stops them from building up in my body and I feel way better. I started working out a lot to help my mood swings and anxiety which helped with mood. The pill helped my skin a tiny bit (I am also on oxytetracyline now which has helped so much in combination with the pill).  If you take this pill you need to be working out a lot and eating really healthy/just looking after yourself in general in order to minimise the negative effects. It is a good pill compared to others,mira

Lets start with the positives- I feel less stressed about pregnancy (I still use condoms just in case though), my acne has stayed the same as it was when I took pills just for acne - providing I have a good routineNegatives- I had quite a lot of nausea which comes and goes but overall is manageable but can make me quite tired! I had a lottt of spotting and bleeding but I didn't find it much of an issue apart from the fact that I have to wear pads all the time. Sometimes I was a bit achy- especially my boobs but they definitely got larger! Before taking Yasmin, I had been diagnosed with depression and anxiety and my biggest concern about taking Yasmin was that I'd heard it makes your mental health worse, but for me it has stayed the same with sometimes feeling a bit more emotional over small things, but it's manageable!",lily

I had never been so sick in my life to the point I'm scared to try other hormonal birth control again, regardless of what format it is in. I don't want to scare anyone too badly, but remember this drug has been recalled several times for causing blood clots and causing death in many young women, causing Bayer millions of dollars in lawsuits (Yasmin and Yaz). If you want hormonal BC, I'd go with another form of progestin like Levonorgestrel or something and NOT drospirenone.

I’ll start with the positives- it does it’s main job of preventing pregnancy and has definitely helped my skin clear up.

I noticed that during the 7 days break, I would not get new breakouts so eventually I decided to quit the pill. Few weeks after stopping the pill I felt a huge difference. My weight is back to normal, no headaches, no mood swings. My skin cleared in just one month and I have no breakouts now, but the damage on my skin was so big that I'm still struggling to heal the scars left. I felt from the beginning that something was not right and went back to the doctor to ask for advice, but they told me to wait few more months for the pill to work. I waited 2 more months.

I was having severe panic attacks that were making me dissociate and become very detached from reality (making me panic further), and my paranoid thoughts became delusional! I had to start therapy and 3 months later I’ve finally stopped dissociating but I’m still paranoid and my hormones and mental health have a long way to go till they’re back to pre-pill state. I know its different for everyone there’s many reviews from women who’s anxiety levels go through the roof and others who became suicidal.

It did cause my appetite to go down within the first 8 ish months and then after it had gone up. I kept working out the entire time so my weight never changed. My acne did clear up besides the few spots here and there when my period came around. My period was also light and only lasted about three days. Intimate wise I was fine, maybe even more into it than usual-but it did cause pain sometimes when doing it. I cried a lot after we had finished as well-for no reason.

This reason alone made me continue taking it for over 3 years.Over the last year I noticed that I was experiencing very severe premenstrual syndrome with symptoms of irrational anger and being teary and emotional most of the time. This progressed into terrible depression that I have never experienced before. The sadness and dark thoughts were unrelenting.

Rigvedion turned my life upside down for 18 months - horrendous anxiety for no reason, the start of depression, major brain fog, socially withdrawn and crying nearly everyday. I was pill free for around 3 years after that awful experience.

However after just two months on it I am absolutely exhausted, constant fatigue even though sleeping well, feeling lazy, down, distant and not interested in anything, intense headaches the day before and of my period starting and generally feeling like I could sleep 24/7 and don't want to work or speak to anyone.

However the bad side effects for me were weight gain, I put on roughly half a stone which no matter what I couldn't shift and I was tired all the time. I also had zero sex drive.I'd recommend trying yasmin if you're concerned about acne and particularly if you're looking to come off diannette.

But then with some online research, I found out that Yasmin definitely has a diuretic side effect that causes frequent urination.
