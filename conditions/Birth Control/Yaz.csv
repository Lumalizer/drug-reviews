0,Yaz,Birth Control,3.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"March 23, 2022",0,"I never ever write user experiences but I HAD to with this one. I had a baby in March 2020 and went onto the pill July 2021 (writing this in March 2022) - I went onto the pill and loved that it basically got rid of my period, I hardly ever bled. But I was SEVERELY anxious, borderline depressed. I went to see a psychologist and a psychiatrist for the first time in my life (I am 28) and I was basically diagnosed with delayed post partum depression. I never went onto the antidepressants because my gut told me not to. I am now off the pill for a mere 8 days and I feel better than I have felt over the past 9 months. I cannot believe the impact the Yaz had on my mental health!!!",alexarayne
1,Yaz,Birth Control,1.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"March 16, 2022",0,"I started Yaz because I wanted to switch from my old birth control. My gynecologist suggested Yaz because of the less days off of hormones. I finished out my last pack of my old pill and switched to Yaz. About 2 days into it I had severe stomach cramping. I didn’t put two and two together, I missed work for 2 days and honestly thought I was constipated. The cramping continued once I returned to work, it was throughout the day and food seemed to subside it at times. It would really hurt in the middle of the night and in the mid-afternoon. I debated going to the hospital or doctor to figure out what was wrong.Fast forward through the whole pack, I got the the placebo pills. Within two days the stomach cramps were gone. I thought whatever was wrong was better. I took my first hormone pill on  Sunday, and Monday I had intense cramping again. Not everyone is the same, so it may work for you, just was not a good experience for me",Anonymous
2,Yaz,Birth Control,3.0,,"February 23, 2022",0,"Everyone has different experiences, Yaz was not the pill for me. I was on it for 3 months, and while I was diligent about taking it and it did prevent pregnancy, the side effects I had to switch pills. My mood swings were AWFUL. One minute I’d be fine, and then I’d be biting someone’s head off for no reason and then I’d be sobbing for no reason. It also made my period symptoms worse. The cramping was bad! I had zero sex drive and my bleeding was heavier then I had experienced since middle school. It also did nothing to help with my acne, which I was really hoping it would. I am almost 26 and I’ve been on birth control since I was 14, but stopped for a year or 2 before I got into a serious relationship. This pill does not work for everyone.",Anonymous
3,Yaz,Birth Control,2.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"February 22, 2022",0,"I decided to try YAZ after a bad experience with a different contraceptive pill when I was 18. I'm now 21 and have been on Yaz for 6 months with no luck. Whilst it cleared my acne well, the depression and anxiety that came with it has been unbearable. I have never suffered from any mental health issues in the past and it wasn't until reading these reviews about similar experiences that I realised I'm not crazy. I started having serious issues with my partner and I actually started blaming and resenting him, thinking he was the reason for my change in self confidence, happiness and overall mental wellbeing, I didn't even consider the pill until now. Not only that, but the anxiety has caused me to lose 5kg (making me quite under the healthy weight range) as I feel too sick in my stomach to have an appetite. I have also been continuously spotting for the last 4 out 6 months, contributing to my already low iron levels. Time to cease using YAZ.",Anon

I've dealt with anxiety and depression in the past, but before starting it, I was in a very good spot mentally. I can't say for certain that this pill caused my psychotic break but I've never experienced something like this before. Thank you to all the women who have posted on this, sharing the same struggle. While the pill affects people differently, if you've struggled with mental issues in the past, I highly recommend looking for a different option.",Lani
5,Yaz,Birth Control,4.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"February 8, 2022",0,"I’ve been taking Yaz a little over two years now, and it’s decent, but I honestly feel like it hasn’t done much for me. I started when I was 15, and my cycles are the same as they were before. My acne did clear up, but I also got older and stopped soccer, so I wasn’t sweating all summer, so there could’ve been that correlation too. There’s been no help with my mood or emotions and it’s starting making me very bloated, even though I’ve had the same exercise regime. I do think it’s made me more prone to anxiety and intrusive thoughts, but it hasn’t been debilitating. I think I’m going to look for other solutions, mostly because it isn’t really doing much for me besides making me a little unstable.",Sarina

7,Yaz,Birth Control,1.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"January 20, 2022",0,"This pill sent my daughter into 18 months of a pure nightmare - of suicidality, depression, and overall psychotic behavior. Uncontrollable mood swings every single day. Doctors could never find a solution - until I finally found a professor in Australia doing the profoundly critical work on this pill. She has reams of data supporting others suffering from this pill. And we attended a stand up comedy night - and one comedian did a bit on how insane YAZ makes you - and the entire auditorium cheered in unison - hundreds of women- acknowledging this shared perspective. My daughter and I gasped with an A-HA moment. Within 5 weeks of coming off this pill - after 18 months taking it - my daughter was a totally different human being. She is now on Lolo. and things are great.YAZ should be illegal.",Concerned Mom

I am taking it for hormone replacement as well as acne issues.During the first month of taking the pill, my skin went through a horrible purge which lasted about three weeks. After that was over, my skin began to improve daily. I rarely get breakouts now (occasionally a single pimple), my hair is so thick and healthy and my sleeping has improved immensely.I have found my moods have been really stable whilst on this pill and have had zero issues with spotting.I have lost about 12 kg since I commenced this pill and that was during lockdown and with minimal additional exercise.

10,Yaz,Birth Control,2.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"December 2, 2021",0,"I really thought this birth control was working great for me at first, as my acne was clearing up and unlike other birth controls like Larissa, it did not make me feel like I was in a fog 24/7 and depressed. It stabilized my moods. However, after working out (day 5 of the first day pack) I noticed a vein in my pointer finger, discoloration, and pain that was getting worse. I have never had a vein show in my finger, so I immediately realized I had 2 blood clots: one in my middle finger, and one in my pointer finger. I have tested negative for Factor Five (a blood clotting disorder) and do not smoke. I was already hesitant to start this birth control considering the lawsuits, but my PCOS/ endometriosis is a huge problem and leaves me in pain 24/7 that I’m desperate to try anything that works. I feel like this was a blessing in disguise because thank god it was only a blood clot in my finger. Some women have died from blood clots in the brain and heart from this drug.

I found myself frequently angry and fought with close friends over nothing. I couldn't do my job properly due to the feeling of overwhelming anxiety.

13,Yaz,Birth Control,10.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"November 8, 2021",1,"I started Yaz a few months ago after I had terrible effects from Blisovi and I am beyond pleased with this birth control. Works well as a contraceptive but that’s not all. I had HORRIBLE cramps, long periods, and excessive bleeding before starting Yaz. It’s been a couple months now and I’ve never felt better. I haven’t had any cramping whatsoever, my periods have gotten so short that they last one to two days (It typically lasted 3-4 days before Yaz), and the bleeding is light and basically just spotting. I also haven’t had any bad side effects like I had on Blisovi, no more mood swings, month long cramping, not as depressed, no more nausea during and before periods. This pill has completely changed my periods and it no longer feels like the nightmare it was lol. Would definitely recommend Yaz :)",nicole
14,Yaz,Birth Control,6.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"October 31, 2021",1,"For anyone considering Yaz, I just need to stress the importance of exercise while on this pill. I am currently on my 2nd packet of Yaz, and so far it has been extremely up and down. The first month was great, my period was light, less cramps, no mood swings, weight loss. However the middle of the second month anxiety and depression hit me so hard. I kept having horrible self-depricating thoughts, would often cry myself to sleep and find it difficult to have a fun time, and I got kicked out of my friend group. Even my relationship with my boyfriend went really bad, however he was very understanding through it all. Yaz has calmed down a little, however I still get irritated very easily and usually overthink more than normal. Not as much depression though, it's more just anger and irritation. However, I found exercising regularly with high intensity cardio (running, biking etc) really improved those nasty thoughts and moods.",Anonymous
15,Yaz,Birth Control,1.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"October 20, 2021",0,"I was on Yaz for slightly under a year for birth control and for regulating my periods. During this time, I had light, almost painless periods. I also enjoyed ultra clean and glowing skin. However, I started getting very bad migraines. I already suffered from migraines before this but I was getting 2-3 migraines a week. My hair also dropped out in CLUMPS. After speaking with my dermatologist I gathered enough courage to finally quit Yaz in September 2020. I started breaking out like crazy and my skin was much, MUCH worse than it ever was prior to being on it. My skin is still like a war zone more than 1 year after quitting it and I deeply regret putting myself on Yaz. I had a light period and it disappeared for a few months. I had to be put on 2 months of norethisterone to trigger my period. It came, but it disappeared again for a few more months.

Before Yaz I ate Diane 35 for PCOS symptoms for couple of years. I got so used to being moody and never knowing if the next day would be ok or filled with unexplained anxiety, crying and in general just annoyed about everything . I had started to feel that I am just a difficult moody person and I was looking to seek psychological help, as my moodiness started to negatively affect my relationship as well. Due to the high blood clot risks of Diane I decided to change the pill to Yaz. Within the first week of Yaz I felt that a cloud had been lifted from top of my head and I could see the positive sides of life again. I don't remember if I've been this calm and able to enjoy life during the time of taking Diane. I had some nausea, fatigue and stomach problems during the first days, but the positive effects on my mental state make all those side effects insignificant",Rosa

My sister told me she developed acne on Yaz so she went off and that a friend of hers had suicidal thoughts. Well, maybe this should have deterred me, but I felt I should try because everyone’s different! So I tried the brand name and in the first few days I felt light headed. I also felt sort of snappy when I’m normally really easy going. WELL, on the morning after taking my 4th pill I FELL APART. I was pacing up and down the hall crying for no reason. I also could barely move or get up, my mental and physical abilities shut down. Thank god I wasn’t working. I called my doc through my tears and she said go off right away!

I don’t know if it was related to this pill or something else. My usual birth control pill came back in stock again, I asked my doctor if I should go back to that one again and he said probably not and he said Yaz is better for acne. But then my head was thinking that I didn’t have an acne problem, I had an itching problem. Later on I noticed that itch was listed as one of the side effects of Yaz in the papers it came with it.

EXTREME nausea, dizziness, no energy whatsoever and the worst symptom of all- the absolute worst anxiety of my life. After the initial month of dealing with the physical side effects, I was still left with crippling anxiety.

There are some good points, It made my period really light, and I had no cramps at all. Unlike other BCs that I have taken in the past, Yaz gave me the least breakthrough bleeding. There was little spotting the first few days and after it was gone which I thought was pretty great. However, it made me incredibly sad. I was soaking in this great despair and had no idea what the was going on with me. I am usually a positive lady and never felt like this in my entire life. My sex drive was lower than usual and I also got a yeast infection for the first time ever. I have a head full of hair and I started to lose so much within a month that I am completely shocked. My OBGYN advised I should be on the pill for at least three months so that my body gets used to it.

I got off the pill for a little less than two years, and started Yaz as I got into a serious relationship. At first, Yaz was great; it cleared my acne, shortened my periods. The down sides of it are that my periods never come on the placebo days, which gives me anxiety about being pregnant. Yaz has also suppressed my sex drive A LOT. This has caused many arguments in my relationship. My mood has been affected, but not as much as it was on Blisorvi-Fe. I have been tired a lot, which I’m not sure is caused by the pill, but it could be. I also feel like it has suppressed my personality, and made me a little bland, if that makes sense.

My blood tests were normal and so was my ultrasound. After a while I went off them to try and get pregnant but never did. Periods came back the same as before and decided to try Yaz again. So back to month 2 now of yaz and I'm still on my period. I has not stopped since before I went on Yaz.

In summary, it's only been a month, but I can't say that I have observed any definite side effects - my emotions, acne, etc, are all within the normal range of what I would expect for my current circumstances. Re: libido, while I might be a bit drier, I was using condoms before and not having to use those more than makes up for it. One thing I did notice was that during the first couple of weeks I was waking up at around 2 AM feeling slightly off and struggling to get to sleep, but that seems to have gone away. As far as the positive effects, I haven't noticed any difference; acne is slightly worse than average but within the range of normal, no difference in body hair.",SkinnyPCOS

I had health issues on the side. Which I worked to diagnose for many years. Oddly, doctors never making the correlation. I did stop taking Yaz, so I could conceive: and within 3 months months ALL of my mystery medical issues disappeared. It was only then I made the correlation. It is from this experience I believe that over time, I developed IBS and malabsorption issues. This lead to health issues such as anxiety, low iron, and low energy. These issues bring on a host of other issues as they have a follow on effect. It is for this reason I would highly caution against Yaz.",Raven
85,Yaz,Birth Control,8.0,,"November 30, 2019",5,"I took Yaz from age 16 to 27, 11 years. It made me gain a little weight, for the past couple years I experienced brain fog and memory loss, and my sex drive was non existent. But other than that Yaz worked fine for me; no cramps, no acne, super regular period, no PMS, no migraines.However, after 11years of pumping pretty high doses of estrogen and progesterone (in this case Drosperinone) into my body, I started to ask myself if it is dangerous in the long run... especially because of the memory issues, the brain fog etc.So I switched to an hormonal IUD recently (containing progesterone only and no estrogen) and so far I like it...I don't have to remember to take the pill and the dose of hormones is 100 times lower on my iud than with Yaz. I think it is fine for a limited time span, but you should definitely look into other contraceptive methods, there are more than you think :) also: Yaz is expensive (10€/month)",Sama KEUP

Like no matter how much lube I used I would dry up and start bleeding from tears or so I thought. I went to urgent care thinking I may have caught something but no. This pill was making me premenopausal at the age of 24. I was dry because the pill was making my body think I was already 50.

I didn’t have a single panic attack in those 3 months! I had my Dr. switch me to a different generic brand, hoping that might help. Well, I could only stand to be on it for 1 week...

I was extremely cold, to the point that I could never warm up, and so exhausted I was diagnosed with chronic fatigue and could not physically stay awake throughout the day. I never had depression before, but during this time I experienced my first bouts of depression so severe it was debilitating.

I was 41 years old. I thought I was going nuts and never suspected that it was Yaz causing the problems. These symptoms  came on gradually and progressively got worse and more pervasive. After I stopped Yaz and went back to my previous BC pill, it took about 18 months for the symptoms to fully resolve themselves.

I was on Yaz for 6 months and I started to get chest (heart) pain. The chest pain became more frequent and severe, so I went to my Doctor to get their opinion. My Doctor said there is a chance that the Pill (especially Yaz, because of the hormones it uses) can cause clotting of the blood, which can then lodge in various places in the body. I was told to go to Emergency if my leg started to swell, which it did. The pain went away gradually after I stopped Yaz, but I really believe it would've been a serious problem if I kept taking it.

But here's how I feel:  I take the pill at 9:30PM, its somehow preventing the Tylenol 3 I take for pain from working properly.  I feel really fresh in the morning, tired through the day and then ready to hit the bed at a normal time at night.  Overall so far, I like it.  I don't have PMDD or PCOS, my Doctor had me on Alesse because Tri Cyclen was causing me hives.  On the Alesse I realize I felt really anxious and didn't even consider it was the pill until I took Yaz.  Now I feel kind of relaxed and not concerned about everything being perfectly clean.  I'm also hoping for the weight loss and breast increase like others.  I'm 5""1 and just ballooned to 115lbs over summer BBQ's.",missedperiods

I noticed I was emotional when I took the first placebo pill but when I took the 2nd I was back to normal.

My fiance kept bringing up Yaz. I decided to give it a shot since he put up with me so long. I've been happy, acne is going away, no bad side effects and libido is up.

It took two weeks on Yaz to stop the hot flushes (I'm only 42, by the way) and I feel so much better. I do agree, however, that it does make me a little tired and I do have some headaches (during the period week)- but nothing like the monster headaches I got on some other brands. All in all-a good product. I will be on it as long as my doctor allows me to- hopefully to 50.",Anonymous
