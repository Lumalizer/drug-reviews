0,Jolessa,Birth Control,1.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"November 1, 2021",1,"Was put on this as a way to help subside PMDD symptoms. Instead of having crushing anxiety and depression 2 weeks out of every month it would shorten it down to 4 times a year. Sounded great at the time so I tried it. 7 months later I have at least 15 pounds I can’t get rid of. I exercise 6 days a week and watch what I eat but nothing works. Increased appetite, headaches almost daily, my anxiety has gotten to the point where it is every single day instead of just 2 weeks a month. Depressed. Sleep is not good. I would rather go back to my old birth control and just take antidepressants for my anxiety than to deal with these side effects. Already made an appointment to see my gynecologist to make changes.",Ashley S
1,Jolessa,Birth Control,,Taken for 5 to 10 years,"July 31, 2021",0,"I have been on this birth control for 10 years and just found out it gave me a LIVER TUMOR. I am 26. They found it incidentally on a CT scan. It's called an hepatic adenoma and is not cancerous but has a 5% chance of becoming cancer and a 10-30% chance of rupturing which is a life-threatening emergency. It is supposedly ""rare"" but I believe many women go undiagnosed since it is usually asymptomatic. It also causes a high-risk pregnancy. I would weigh the risks/benefits of taking this high amount of estrogen 90 days straight with only 1 week off for over 5 years. This risk is only for long-term use.",RN
2,Jolessa,Birth Control,7.0,,"October 2, 2020",4,"Was on Jolessa birth control for a year and recently stopped taking it because of side effects.  I had very frequent migraines that lasted 2-3 days. I lost my appetite and 10 pounds, as someone who is already very skinny it was concerning. As far as acne, it cleared up a lot until the last three months I was on it, I started getting monster pimples that were painful. I got the chills and fevers almost everyday. My boobs got a full cup size bigger so thats something to look forward to! I also experienced pain during sex and itching in nether regions while on this.  I've tried 4 birth controls and none of them have worked out so you may experience less or more side effects.",Morgan
3,Jolessa,Birth Control,9.0,,"August 27, 2020",15,"39 YO w/two kids 6 and under. Not planning to have anymore kids. Heavy periods w/clotting & anemia. Dr recommended BC to lighten periods. I also wanted to stop having monthly periods. 1st week on Jolessa I had headaches. 3 weeks in  headaches stopped. My skin is clearer. No mood swings. I feel happy but was not prone to depression before. I did feel bloated the first 2 weeks but that has gotten better by week 3, drinking lots of water, exercise & watching calories. No spotting at all. Not having a period for 3 months is improving my quality of life! I had lost nearly 20lbs before the BC. I’m not gaining-working out vigorously and counting calories BUT I do feel like I’m hungrier, craving sweets when I normally don’t and weight loss is slower than before. Overall I’m loving this birth control Jolessa. As far as fitness, it will just motivate me to work harder at working out and monitoring what I eat. I recommend giving it a try. Don’t let negative reviews deter you. I let that stop me for years and suffered.",Happy Mom
4,Jolessa,Birth Control,8.0,,"April 7, 2020",10,"I started Jolessa in April 2019 and I’ve had an overall good experience with it. The last 3 weeks I had to wear a liner (most times no spotting would actually make it on there the first 2 weeks, I would notice the spotting when wiping while using the bathroom). When my cycle would actually come, it wasn’t super heavy; only needing to change my pad maybe twice a day (if that). Cramps during my cycle were very manageable with ibuprofen and I had a lot of bloating during the second month. The only thing I didn’t like about Jolessa is I think it contributed to my weight gain, about 15 lbs, during this year. I’m considering stopping the pill to try to get my weight back under control though. Other than that, I haven’t had any bad side effects and my experience has been good with it!",Anonymous

I have been on my period since the day I started my 2nd month and it just keeps getting heavier.  I feel like its never going to stop. I  am moody mentally unstable super depressed, my cramps are starting to get worse and worse with every day, so far not happy at all and all the dr can tell me is to stick with it.",B
6,Jolessa,Birth Control,5.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"July 13, 2019",5,"I started taking Jolessa in May 2018 and it worked very well for me until recently. I started Jolessa because I had really bad cramps while on my period and heavy bleeding, Jolessa seemed to fix that problem where I never really had any cramps and had a very light period. A couple weeks ago I noticed that I was spotting, which I had never had on this birth control before, but I thought it was normal. Then I started to have AWFUL cramps to the point where it would bring me to tears. After this went on for about three weeks I made an appointment with my OBGYN for an ultrasound, where she found that Jolessa caused me to have a blood clot in my uterus. Ever since I stopped taking Jolessa, my problems have stopped and I’m hopeful that my blood clot will dissolve by my next ultrasound appointment.",Anonymous

That’s done, but now I’m still bleeding even though my period finished almost a week ago.  Woke up this morning with brown blood running down my legs and saw big clots on the toilet paper when I wiped myself.  That has never happened to me with any of the other contraceptives I’ve taken (Yaz, Tri Sprintec, progestin-only pills, Nexplanon).

8,Jolessa,Birth Control,1.0,,"December 19, 2018",4,"Horrible experience with this birth control. Had INTENSE cramping start within the first week and it has only gotten worse. It’s a constant dull aching pain with waves of extreme stabbing pains all day every day. After 8 weeks I am calling it quits. Also, I started my period after 4 weeks... it was strange. However, did not experience any weight gain as many others have... overall, would not recommend at all. STAY AWAY!",:-(
9,Jolessa,Birth Control,1.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"August 9, 2018",3,"Reason for medication also includes irregular menstrual cycle, Bilateral breast pain (ongoing), menstrual migraines.Years ago; I was on the brandname Seasonelle and had minimal issues. When my insurance changed at 23, I tried Jolessa due to the brand name being $235 (circa 2012). I remember having terrible mood swings, weight gain, acne, so I stopped taking it. Fast forward to 2018, I asked my doctor to try BC again due to irregularity and breast pain. Since the name brand drug  now costs $435, I was forced to try Jolessa again.I have bled for 26 days straight and have stopped taking the pill. There has been no trade off as far as my symptoms being reduced.. I have had cramping, breast pain, and headaches and the excessive bleeding. I do not recommend this generic medication.",Unhappy woman
10,Jolessa,Birth Control,7.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"August 8, 2018",6,"My experience with Jolessa hasn’t been bad. I started the pill about a year ago. Just like with most birth control pills, they all come with a few side effects. I noticed while on this pill during the last month of taking it I would have a lot of spotting but not an actual full blown period, I found it annoying because I’d constantly have to wear a pad/liner over the course of the month because of the spotting. Birth control pills definitely affect your mood change as well especially for me, I tend to feel more grumpy and short tempered. I also feel like you gain more weight while on birth control.  My recommendation before starting this pill is to know that you’re basically shutting down hormones in your body which causes these side effects, so don’t think the entire experience with birth control will be terrific, all the while it does help prevent pregnancy and menstrual cramps which are the reasons why I’m on Jolessa. But give it a try and see how your body adjusts to it. :)",Bec
11,Jolessa,Birth Control,8.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"July 23, 2018",5,"I’ve been taking Jolessa since 2016, and I’ve had some weird side effects from it. During the 3rd month, I would experience weird brown discharge and VERY slight bleeding for the whole month, which causes me to wear very thin liners for an entire month. I would also experience slight cramping, but nothing too terrible and it isn’t an everyday thing. Other than these two effects, I don’t have any other complains about Jolessa. (With the out-of-pocket expense, I found a coupon that does save me quite a bit on the pill itself, so I don’t actually spend that much every 3 months, but that’s how much it would normally cost.)",FearfulFemale
12,Jolessa,Birth Control,5.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"June 26, 2018",3,I have been taking Jolessa since October 2016. I have only had a few months this whole time that I did not spot or bleed heavily. I have bad cramps during my period and clotting while on this pill. I noticed that my sex drive is much less and I am more dry during sex. I was not like this before I started taking this. It does prevent pregnancy. I am not sure if it is worth taking anymore. I recently found out I have a corn intolerance and Micro-crystalline cellulose is in this pill. My skin is super dry and I did gain weight. Some of these symptoms could be peri-menopause since I am 45. I did read that it is supposed to help prevent those symptoms but it has not for me.,Angela
13,Jolessa,Birth Control,1.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"June 11, 2018",8,"This medication is awful. I immediately started with breast tenderness/ soreness, then came joint pains and massive headaches. Then there were sharp pains in my lower abdomen that would last about ten seconds and I would have them throughout the day. I’m barely 19, healthy and have had regular periods for the past two years. I just wanted something to help cramps and it sounded like a dream when my gynecologist told me I’d only bleed 4 times a year ! I just finished my second month and I’ve been bleeding for 6 days now ! I’m not even supposed to be bleeding! I’m not even talking about spotting I’m talking about HEAVY bleeding. Before I started this medication my periods were light/regular and only lasted 5 days MAX. This is one of the worst decisions I’ve ever made, the side effects are not worth it. I’d rather get my period every month than deal with this. Don’t get on this medication.",cara
14,Jolessa,Birth Control,9.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"April 10, 2018",5,"I love this birth control pill. I haven’t had any issues and it does it’s job, besides darkening discharge a couple of weeks before the period pills. I think this is a small price to pay to have a period every three months (I often don’t even get a period).

15,Jolessa,Birth Control,6.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"March 29, 2018",3,"I wanted a BC that stopped my periods and this did it for me so I'm happy about that. The downside is weight gain. I gained about 10 pounds over the past year. I exercise daily (personal trainer) and I eat healthy. No matter what kind of diet 'cut' I do... nothing changes. Also, my hormonal acne is insane. My skin consultant offered a routine to help me minimize my break outs but even still they happen. So while I no longer have a cycle and cycle pain I have an extra 10 lbs and hormone acne.

17,Jolessa,Birth Control,3.0,,"February 24, 2018",1,I was on depo for 10 years and had to stop because of demineralized bones. I enjoyed not having periods for those many years. The dr said to try jolessa. I was on it for 5 years. I always had bleeding 2 weeks before it was due in the pack. And slowly my hair had thinned out on my scalp. It took me forever to figure out why my hair was coming out rampantly. Yes it was 5 years of hair loss. Not even the dermatologist was sure what was causing it cause all my blood work came back normal.  Shortly after stopping jolessa recently.  I noticed little baby hairs growing on my hairline. Which I am so thankful for. I believe I may just be sensitive to birth control hormones or the synthetic hormones they use. So I'm choosing to using the cervical cap with contraceptive gel.,Sariah

I get most of the side effects which are exactly like my usual period symptoms and they only happen the week before or week during my period. Which is exactly how it was before I was on Jolessa.

29,Jolessa,Birth Control,1.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"November 16, 2016",7,"This medication caused massive and sub-massive pulmonary embolisms; as well as a major saddle embolus. Thus causing my right ventricle to become enlarged, resting pulse to become over 150 and lowered my oxygen levels.

I am a healthy female in my 20's who took low does estrogen B.C. pills for years until I switched to this drug. Months later and I am on blood thinners and unable to continue my schooling or physically demanding job. It seemed to be working fine. Over time I started developing what I thought was back strain, or from overworking my abs. Turns out the pain was actually caused by the lack of oxygen to my lung tissue which is now dead (infarction). I was in physical therapy for weeks until the shortness of breathe kicked in. I'm a runner. There was no way I got out of shape that fast. I pushed. They considered asthma. After my heart ""was nearly beating out of your chest and I could hear it without my stethoscope"" said my NP- I got a CT which revealed the clots and was immediately admitted for EKOS surgery (direct catheter thrombolysis).

When I started taking jolessa, I gained weight very quickly, going from 160lbs (I was 145lbs before depo shot) to 200lbs in like 6 months. No matter how healthy I eat, or how much I exercise, the weight won't drop. Even doing p90x I can't get anywhere weight wise. This pill also totally killed my sex drive. I get moody, especially if I forget to take it a day or two, and start taking it again. I'm always tired. I never had any issues with pimples ever in my life, but when I take the white pills for the period or forget to take a few pills, I break out SO bad. I hate this pill.",Nab07070

I started using this birth control because I was having migraines every period, so hopefully I will only have period induced migraines every three months.
