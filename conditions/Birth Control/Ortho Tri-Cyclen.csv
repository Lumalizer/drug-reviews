1,Ortho Tri-Cyclen,Birth Control,1.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"January 9, 2022",0,"It did its job- prevent pregnancy. The side effects that came with not being pregnant, however, was not worth it . It immensely affected my mood which in turn affected my relationship. I also gained about 10 lbs which affected my mental health as I already had body image and self esteem issues. Overall, I don't think its worth it.",maysunshine

5,Ortho Tri-Cyclen,Birth Control,1.0,,"January 4, 2021",0,"This birth control gave me the worst side effects. I went on this medication mainly for acne only for it to get worse. Not only that, I became extremely irritable and gave me terrible mood swings. It did nothing for making my periods lighter but did ease cramps. After taking it for around 4 months, I stopped taking it. My acne came back 10 times worse as well as worsening my mental health. I DO NOT RECOMMEND! My appetite was also increased so much to the point that I could not get full, resulting in weight gain",j

It got worse, due to the eye dryness plus contacts, I got scarring on my eye ball to where I couldn’t wear contacts and just keeping my eyes open was painful..went to doctors and opthamologists for two years to have it corrected - it was a nightmare!

I would bloat up massively before my period, and I’ve gained 15 pounds ever since I started. Apparently birth control pills aren’t supposed to cause weight gain, however I don’t think this is a coincidence. On top of that, my hair fell out over the first three months. The only positive has been perfect clear, glowing skin. I do recommend if you have acne, but the weight gain has made me so depressed I hate to even leave my house.",Oceanna

17,Ortho Tri-Cyclen,Birth Control,9.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"October 24, 2018",2,"This birth control was great as a contraceptive, no pregnancy scares ever. It also took away any pain and made me have less bleeding during the period, which was a withdrawal time of course. However, with this pill my acne got worse. It would concentrate on my cheeks and chin. Before taking this pill my skin was perfectly clear but after I would get more pimples which would leave scarring on my face. I gave it four months because I heard you should try a birth control for three months before quitting, but the acne has reminded constant. The pill did make me gainsome more boobs so I guess that was a plus.  Due to the fact that I don’t need a contraceptive anymore, I stopped taking this pill and also in hopes of my  skin going  back to normal.",Jen
18,Ortho Tri-Cyclen,Birth Control,1.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"September 16, 2018",7,My best friend and I were both switched to tricylcen because it was a heavier dose of hormone and would help make our periods lighter and help with acne. My acne got worse on the pill and I found myself emotional but it was effective at preventing pregnancy as it was the only form of birth control my partner and I were using. My best friend was also on tricyclen and she recently found out she was pregnant. She was responsible with her pill and never missed a dose. I went with her to get the abortion where the nurse told us the pill  is only 91% effective. 9 out of every 100 women get pregnant while on tricyclen. Those were numbers I did not know when I was prescribed it and since learning that I have switched to another form of birth control.,Study978

I will say, the pill helped regulate my period and lighten the flow as well as making it a little less painful, BUT.. I figured out that this pill wins the entire cause of my acne!! I always had nice skin & this pill made me have the WORST acne. Every inch of my face was covered in nasty clogged pores, it wasn’t even cystic acne. Just extremely bumpy & I was always embarrassed. Anyways I immediately changed pills as soon as I came across the idea and within a month or two of changing pills my face really calmed down. The pill was literally the only thing I changed in my life.  My face will never be the same now but at least I figured it out!!",Jules

Anyway I have been using it for 5 months now and I hate it I did noticed that my period is longer and hurts more but my main concern was when and if I miss a pill (which happens) and I mean one I get my period right away! This time I got my period in a weeks time from the last one!!!! And I have been taking birth controls for 7 years and I never had problems with my period before always in a month a part.,Annoyed
25,Ortho Tri-Cyclen,Birth Control,4.0,,"April 12, 2018",4,"Was on this pill for a year & went through hell. The only good thing is it kept me from getting pregnant, & I gained no weight. I started to get yeast infections, UTI's, long periods with the worst cramps, & had mood swings. All of these I have never experienced before & I’ve been on different birth controls for about 4 years, nothing else in my life had changed to cause any of that except for taking the pill. I later on started to develop a constant urge to urinate & do so frequently it affected my job, sleeping, & sanity. I went to doctors about it, antibiotics would not work because it wasn’t caused by a UTI. Did some research & found out many others had been suffering from the urination problem & it has all been linked to this pill! Since then I switched my birth control & my urination has significantly changed back to normal. I will never take this pill again nor recommend it. If you don’t want to get pregnant it’ll work, but totally not worth going through the side effects.",Anonymous

27,Ortho Tri-Cyclen,Birth Control,6.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"March 7, 2018",5,My first pills I took were regular orthcyclen. I switched due to bleeding between cycles to another pill. They pill worked for awhile until I had more breakthrough bleeding a year in. They then switched me to this. I had no irregular bleeding. But over 6+ months me & my partner noticed a big change in my moods. I already struggle with depression and anxiety and it wasn't for 8 or so months that I had a full on mental breakdown unlike I have EVER had. I started thinking about it & I really have a low stress life at the moment so I looked for triggers. Then I thought about the fact that this is a TRI phasic pill which means constantly changing hormones from week to week. I feel like that hormonal swing could possibly be that trigger. Immediately set up an appointment and switched to a monophasic pill & my mood has changed tenfold. Not a good pill for people with already touchy mental health in my opinion.,Rab00

But honestly the erratic depression is too much to handle and I'm not a fan of taking a pill everyday so I'm going to switch to an IUD. I do get a lot of food cravings and I suspect that's why everyone posts about weight gain. Just be smarter than your cravings and work out more.",AllieBee

I will say the very first week on this BC I had incredible mood swings and it really intensified my depression and anxiety but after the first week I had no problems. I'm not sure if this pill caused me to lose weight or if it was stress from school, either way in the past 3 months I've lost about 5 pounds. Wish it made my boobs grow though, oh well.",Annahh

My main concern was weight gain by starting b/c... But I've actually lost 10 pounds since being on this pill. My skin has cleared up. Periods last 3-4 days very light. No cramps. ONLY issue was the first 3 months I kept experiencing a few yeast infections... But that issue stopped as soon as I started taking a daily probiotic. I will admit sometimes I am moody & emotional but I don't know if I can blame the pill entirely lol. My appitite is up & down at times but honestly that's all about self-control.
