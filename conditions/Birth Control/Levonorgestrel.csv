0,Levonorgestrel,Birth Control,1.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"April 1, 2022",0,"Mirena (levonorgestrel):I’ve had my first IUD put in late October early November 2021 went back for my 6 week string check and it was falling out, so my OB took it out and ordered me a new one. Fast forward to beginning of March 2022 I got my new one insured and as of today April 2022 they could not find the stings or the IUD in and ultrasound. Other than that they weren’t bad to have but the pain is NOT worth getting it put in for them to fall out TWICE!",Squirrel
1,Levonorgestrel,Birth Control,1.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"March 31, 2022",0,"Skyla (levonorgestrel):I had Skyla for the full three years and let me tell you I would not recommend this to anyone. EVER. I never had bad acne prior to getting Skyla and since getting it I've had awful acne, worse then I've ever had. My mood swings were terrible and the pain I had from it for the full three years was an awful experience. The pain would radiate down my legs and I would have to be balled up in a fetal position until the cramp subsided. My periods where never regular and always heavy through out the entire three years. I already had anxiety and depression prior too but my anxiety and depression got a lot worse since having Skyla. My depression got more dark. My anxiety more high and my will to be around people almost non-existent, even around my SO. I would have panic attacks in the middle of the night for no absolute reason, granted I have in the past as well but with Skyla they were a lot more frequent and I couldnt figure out why. I got it out the other day and since my pain has subsided.",Jenny
2,Levonorgestrel,Birth Control,2.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"March 30, 2022",1,"Kyleena (levonorgestrel):I got Kyleena inserted towards the end of September and have had it now for 6 months. The insertion was painful, but definitely bearable. I bled/spotted lightly for about 3 months straight, and although long periods of bleeding, it was an extremely light flow. The concept of Kyleena is amazing and you can't even tell it's there. Fast forward to now, I am now developing severe anxiety, brain fog, and intense feelings of worry/paranoia which is interfering with my daily life. I experienced my first panic attack one month after insertion, with increased anxiety, but it was manageable and I expected things to get better with time. Now, this has become a daily struggle and I feel like I've lost my sense of self. Luckily I've never had any pain or cysts, no increase in acne, no dryness, and my libido has stayed the same. I'm sad I have to get it removed, but it is not worth the mental side effects.",sota girl
3,Levonorgestrel,Birth Control,10.0,Taken for 10 years or more,"March 29, 2022",3,"Mirena (levonorgestrel):Hello ladies! I’d like to share my happy story!! So, in June 2009 I had the Mirena inserted after my second born. I’ve had a great experience with it. Lighter to no period. At first I bled for a month straight. Then it was lighter, then I started seeing brown discharge, then no periods at all! Well it’s been about 2 1/2 years since I’ve had my replacement. My OB checked it this fall still in the same place and working properly.Before I had Mirena my periods were heavy and bled so much I had to change my clothes. It’s almost been 14 years and I’ll gladly be at my next appointment to get it switched for a new one. Thank you for letting me share!!",Anonymous

Anyway, I thought I'd share my experience for people trying to decide as I'm coming up on the 5 year mark of having it.Pros: Little to no period after the first several months.  This is WAY nicer than I thought it was going to be. Zero pregnancy scares while having unprotected sex. Don't have to remember to take a pill.  Cons: I have a very high pain tolerance and almost fainted after insertion, I really wasn't expecting that to be a problem for me.  I had some type of bleeding or spotting everyday for a good 6-7 MONTHS.  Again, after that basically no period for 4 years.  I did get acne that took me a year to figure out how to manage and I've never had acne before.  After 2 years I did gain quite a bit of weight I can't seem to lose.  I do have bad anxiety, but I've always struggled with this a little.",Anonymous

It’s nice to not have to worry about birth control for 5 years.  I have not experienced any mood changes with this form of birth control, which I did experience with birth control pills.  Also, no weight gain or changes in libido.  The cons for me have been the following:  had heavy periods for the first 9 months, random cramping on and off especially the first year, oily skin (honestly, doesn’t bother me anymore since I know how to take care of my skin, my skin is already oily to begin with) and unpredictable spotting at times.  With all that said, I would get this same IUD because the pros outweigh the cons for me.",Caligirl519
7,Levonorgestrel,Birth Control,2.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"March 25, 2022",3,"Kyleena (levonorgestrel):The initial insertion was ok, and then I had a kind of brown sludge discharge that lasted for 4 months. It finally stopped, and the good news was my period had stopped along with it. I didn't notice many adverse effect until the 2.5 - 3 year mark. After having this in long term, my hormones went crazy. I developed panic attacks, anxiety, brain fog, insomnia, and have never had any of these things in my life. I spoke with many psychologists and finally upon advice from my therapist, I took the Kyleena out and had my hormones tested. My progesterone (calming hormone Kyleena releases) was almost 0. Your body becomes dependant on the birth control. If I had knows the havoc this would cause, I would have never gotten the IUD. Hormonal birth control can cause SO many long term problems doctors don't warm you about, and many of my friends had the same crash. If you do choose to get this IUD please please closely observe how it impacts your body. IMO NOT worth it at all.",Nic

9,Levonorgestrel,Birth Control,8.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"March 24, 2022",0,Kyleena (levonorgestrel):I got Kyleena inserted about a month and a 1/2 ago. I forgot to take ibuprofen so I was very nervous about it. I tried to relax my body during the procedure to prevent pain as much as possible. It was 9/10 painful at the worst part and I bled a lot afterwards for two days. The first period afterwards was pretty painful and lasted two weeks with lots of painful cramps. My second period also has lots of painful cramps so far. I have tested the effectiveness three times and so far it works for birth control. I figure the pain and cramps will eventually subside within the next months. The cramps are extremely painful and ibuprofen and heat don’t help. I read all of these reviews before and knew it wasn’t going to be fun but I hope it’ll be worth it after my body adjusts.,veronica

11,Levonorgestrel,Birth Control,9.0,,"March 23, 2022",0,"Kyleena (levonorgestrel):I want to share my experience because I know that I was reading patient experiences nonstop before I had my procedure! I had Kyleena placed a few days ago and I will admit that the placement was very painful. I became very hot and nauseated from the pain, but it dissipated shortly after the IUD was placed.  I took 800 mg of ibuprofen and a 0.5 mg tablet of alprazolam. I cramped a lot the same day, the cramps were pretty severe but nothing that ibuprofen couldn’t help. After my procedure, my physician did an ultrasound on me to ensure the IUD was in the correct spot, and it was! The next day, I had no cramps and no other symptoms! I highly recommend Kyleena! Don’t stress yourself out with the negative reviews. Everybody has a different body with different responses, so don’t assume that your body will have the same response as someone else :)",amandax3

I had such high hopes for Skyla from what I had read and been told. I gave it a SOLID chance (9 months) before digging into the timeline of things and realizing shortly after getting this is when I gained weight, my hair started thinning, suddenly got cystic acne, cramps were unbearable (and I've had the copper IUD cramps!), and worst of all for the first time in my life was put on bipolar medication and was suicidal three separate occasions (has never happened before).

I know there's some horror stories but from all the people I know in my personal life everyone loves it including me! Just had mine removed as it was clearly expiring and got the Paragard right after, only reason I switched was because it lasts longer and I wanted to see if there would be a difference from having hormonal birth control, but I would definitely get Mirena again!",Zayz

Compared to other forms of birth control this is by far my favorite and affected me the least. That being said there still were some effects. After the incredibly painful but not unbearable insertion I bled for 2 months straight. After that I barely bled at all during my periods. If I took my adderall or sertraline they got much light and I might only spot for a day or 2. Stop the adderall and they come back. I did see an increase in anxiety and depression symptoms but cannot attribute it completely to Kyleena as there were other situational, environmental, medical and physical factors involved.

Please keep in mind everyone is different, and this is my personal experience. I loved Kyleena when I first got it and the duration for the following reasons. My acne got better, eventually my periods would either not show up or be very short like 2-3 days, I no longer experienced much cramping, and I didn't have any complications. Yes, the application and removal HURT! but only for a few moments. Now the negative effects that I experience were weight gain, severe irritability,  varied lengths of depression episodes, and insomnia. Having taken it out I've been slightly more emotional and sensitive, but I'm assuming that's my hormones. However I've had an extreme burst of energy since it's been removed.

Once inserted, I spotted for about 30 days and never had another period for the duration of having Kyleena. I got the MOST PAINFUL ovarian cyst and it took about 3 months to go away. Worst. Pain. Ever. Then my skin went from dry to OILY. So oily. Especially my eyelids. Then I developed eczema on my eyelids due to the excess oil production. I lost hair by the chunks. My hair is about 1/4 of the thickness it use to be 4.5 years prior. I gained about 5lbs per YEAR. So I was 120 when inserted and the heaviest I got was 150 around year 4 and then started exercising and eating healthy and the lowest I could get down to was 140 (which was SO HARD, it was not hard for me prior to Kyleena) I nearly completely lost my sex drive and became very detached emotionally around year 3-4.

IMO pushing a whole baby out of my vagina was less painful (probably bc I was able to take real pain meds instead of a low dose of iBuprofen). I have spotted the entire time. My gynecologist even prescribed pills and IB to stop the bleeding, which it did, but maybe only for a week. I have periodic slight cramping, even when I’m not on my period and occasional clotting discharge. About a month ago, my breasts were so sore they felt like they were on fire. They have never felt like that since I was pregnant, so of course I was terrified and took a pregnancy test. Thank goodness I wasn’t pregnant! But still scary. The main reason I decided to have the IUD inserted was to hopefully have no periods. My regular periods without birth control were light and only lasted 3 days.

All the horrible symptoms that the girls said on Nexplanon reviews I feel like I have it.  Since the insertion of Mirena, I bleed for one month but I think  it’s was due the Nexplanon, because my doctor decided to keep it until make sure Mirena was working to avoid pregnancy.I went to the doctor to remove Nexplanon and check everything was okay with Mirena. The following day, I immediately stop bleeding.I’ve just experienced some irregular brown little bleeding and more loss hair than usual.But everything else is working very well.I recommend Mirena compared with the pills and Nexplanon.",Bel

I did have periods while having it and my cramps (which were pretty much non-existent before Kyleena) were extremely painful right before I would get my period. I experienced extreme side-effects from having the IUD such as weight loss, depression, and severe anxiety. I will say I never had a problem with getting pregnant as the IUD did it’s job. I will be getting it out in April due to the side-effects I can just not deal with anymore. I honestly do not recommend this to anyone at a younger age as I got mine when I was 16 and it is still effecting my mood everyday, even when I’m not on my period.

But I thought that was okay to have the satisfaction of no protection and no periods. Fast forward I decided to get it removed when my boyfriend began getting cuts during sex. Not to mention the mood swings, dry vagina, frequent yeast infections and UTIs. They attempted to go in 2 times to remove it. They couldn’t find it. They took an ultrasound and spotted it and attempted to go in AGAIN to remove it. They were using all kinds of clamps to find it. And could not find the strings.

She mentioned  kyleena but I still said I didn’t want any hormones. So I thought we agreed on ParaGard. I get the IUD inserted and it was painful something I never felt before but nothing I couldn’t live with. I have really bad cramping in the beginning, then it got better. After the 2 1/2 month came around I would get random swings of extreme depression and anxiety. It was affecting my personal and professional life. I thought I was going crazy. I later found out she put the wrong one at it was kyleena. Ladies I really recommend being very stern with what you want to your doctors and before you do anything is going to mess with your hormones.

Anyway, it hurt, and I recall feeling like I was being split in half. I think I cramped for a few days afterwards. Since insertion: Chronic pelvic pain (due to tight pelvic floor muscles. Could be due to the IUD as it started a month after), a cyst rupture, surgery to test for endometriosis (due to the pelvic floor pain), bloating, really light, short periods (yay), and possibly mood swings.

I picked Kyleena as I am a smaller person that has never given birth and I preferred the low dose option over Mirena. When I went in for the insertion it was definitely uncomfortable and painful, but super quick. I took about 800 mg of ibuprofen an hour beforehand and brought a stress ball to squeeze... haha.

From what I read weight gain seems to be a concern for some women although with the absence of estrogen this is extremely uncommon due to the hormone not being present as it is in almost every other contraceptive. I have just two days ago had a new mirena placed aged 38 after going two years with it in place over the 5 year expiration period due to covid lockdown. My body changed but I can already feel the benefits of having a replacement. I cannot rate this IUD enough",Mirena coil

I am not the best with remembering so after talking to my doctor we agreed that an IUD would be the best option. I opted for the Skyla because it was the lowest dose of hormone offered in an IUD other than the Paraguard. It’s also smaller so it was less scary than the Mirena at the time. Immediately after having it I felt strange. The insertion was quick and bearable. I noticed that I had a constant feeling of needing to pee. I went in a few times to see if I had a UTI and I never did. I bled for DAYS each month. I would say about 15-18 days of light bleeding. It was aggravating. As soon as I hit my year mark, my sex drive completely disappeared. I had no desire to have intercourse. It was really hard on my relationship because he felt that I was losing my attraction to him.

They wanted me to have mine removed but turns out, it was my IUD giving me issues. So yes I will be getting my Kyleena removed.

Exactly one month after getting my IUD was when everything went down hill. One month in I developed severe anxiety and depression. I couldn’t go a day without having an anxiety or panic attack. It got so bad to the point that I couldn’t drive my car or go out to eat. Not only was I struggling with anxiety but I didn’t feel my self. I had horrible brain fog and felt mentally off. I am convinced that my IUD caused this. I got it removed about 2 months ago after having it in for only 4 months. I am finally starting to feel more and more myself.

I immediately stopped getting a period which has been great but my weight has continued to climb (not saying it’s entirely due to the IUD of course) and it’s damn near impossible to lose weight with it. My skin is still clear but very oily, and I lose a lot of hair in the shower. I had a hair loss problem with Nexplanon as well so I definitely attribute that to the Kyleena. After 3 years I suddenly started having cramps at random for weeks at a time and spotting frequently- still no periods. The depression has also gotten much worse over the years it’s a struggle.

I was told it is better to get it while you’re on your period, which I did. 3 years later, I have had almost no period symptoms and go through 1-2 softcups (tampon alternatives) per year so I haven’t purchased any period supplies in these 3 years. When my post-menopausal mother said something about how nice it is not to get periods anymore, I agreed instead of wishing I had that freedom. I haven’t noticed a change in mood or weight.

I did however have  sharp pains for the first day of my period the first 3 periods. I think my body is still adjusting! I also have had 3 yeast infections since IUD insertion…which I had never had before. I still get a regular period which gives peace of mind! I've had zero mood/weight/acne changes too! Knowing that no birth control method is perfect (And that I previously had bad experiences w/ BC pill side effects) I think this is an extremely effective form of BC that I would absolutely recommend to women, don’t let the bad reviews scare you :)",kmfester
222,Levonorgestrel,Birth Control,7.0,,"June 22, 2021",0,"Kyleena (levonorgestrel):I choose Kyleena as I wanted contraception that had fewer hormones than the pill I was taking and low maintenance. Whilst the nurses were kind and informative, (giving me pain killers to take an hour before the fitting), it was still immensely painful. If you decide to opt for Kyleena or any other IUD fitting, I would recommend taking the maximum painkillers beforehand and practicing some deep breath and relaxation methods before as these make the fitting less painful. However, do be prepared it is very painful for around 8 minutes, but the more relaxed you can be, the less painful it is. Following the fitting of Kyleena, I experienced bacterial vaginosis which was difficult to get rid of. Therefore before getting it fitted, I would ask your medical professional what you can do to prepare your vaginal bacteria balance before it is fitted. Aside from the painful fitting and the bacterial vaginosis, it has been pain-free. I have periods that are lighter and less painful.",bbadi2019

The reason I got this birth control is because I was about to lose access to my moms health insurance and was hoping this would be a good option because I had 5 years to get a better job and health insurance. Now it looks like a lot of my money is going to have to go towards an exam, possible removal, and trying to find a new birth control.

The best part is knowing I am being extremely safe and that I can feel confident knowing I likely won't get pregnant. And my boyfriend hasn't felt it hehe",Rae

Inserting didn't hurt too bad, but I did bleed for several weeks and spotted for months after that. I would bleed after having sex, every time. I cramp really bad during ovulation and now my periods are longer and heavier than before. They used to be light for 5 days, now they are heavy for 8 days!! And then I spot between.

Consequently, it thus created a lot of scar tissue on the my lining and it was never able to get thick, which is needed for a healthy pregnancy, because of the scarring it caused. As a result, I miscarried and have now had three hysteroscopy surgeries to remove excess scar tissue which couldn’t be from an early miscarriage.

Everyone I knew with an IUD told me that it was such an incredibly painful insertion BUT I found it not to be. At most it was slightly uncomfortable. For the rest of the month, I've had minimal to no cramping, slight acne and my first menstruation since has been longer than normal but other than that no different at all. All the advice I could give someone reading these reviews is that, you are never going to know how the process goes until you do it. Try it out and if it doesn't work for you, you can always get it taken out. Although, I would recommend doing your research with your doctors though.

I’ve noticed a couple of mild headaches since getting Kyleena. It’s hard to say if it’s causing me to eat more, I did have COVID and lost 14 pounds during my sickness and a stress eater to begin with (uni student). I am here because I have been getting random bursts of cramps, last a few minutes then come back later on which usually happens at night. Yet to see how it affects my period and if the cramps will improve. I recommend this so far, remember it can be taken out and the insertion is pressure and shouldn’t be painful.

The first 6 months I was going to tough it out as doctors told me it would go away, but it did not. I had insane cramping (like contractions) on the daily or at random, causing me to constantly need to bring Advil everywhere I go. I had extreme fatigue (naturally I’m very energetic), I had a hard time working out as I would get really sore quick/not have the energy. I would get dizzy spells, headaches/migraines, sweats as well plus insane PMS that was uncontrollable and hard to predict. What was the most striking was how much weight I gained that I couldn’t lose when I was on a strict diet + working out daily which was extremely discouraging. This has been reoccurring for the time I’ve been on it. Also I had uncomfortable intercourse, I would either bleed or get cramping after. I’ve been on the pill and this experience was 50x worse.

I do not have cramps, and I have had an ultrasound to ensure proper device placement. I know that irregular bleeding is common in the first few months of use, but I did not expect the bleeding to be this persistent or this heavy.

I'm a small woman (5' 100 lbs) & previously partially expelled a Paragard IUD due to the small size of my uterus. I always wanted to avoid ANY sort of hormonal BC out of fear of side effects. When the Paragard was taken out, I decided to take a chance on Skyla (smallest IUD size, lowest hormone dosage). My next form of BC was going to be FAM, that's how much I wanted to avoid hormones. Well, after insertion (which felt awful, but that's not surprising), I've been GREAT. I felt virtually no cramps post-insertion. I've had zero hair loss, acne, or mood swings whatsoever (and trust me, I've been paying close attention.) My first period post-Skyla was normal but with ~2 weeks of light brown spotting afterwards. I'm guessing this will diminish with time, since the uterine lining will continue to thin. A recent ultrasound confirmed everything looks great. If things stay the way they are, I'd happily get another Skyla in 3 years. Yay!",Gemma

I had spotting for almost 3 weeks after insertion and cramping stopped after day 2. My periods are only spotting now. It also has definitely helped my moods. It gave me a lot of acne around the 3rd month on my face and chest and never had acne there, but it’s better. I also gained some weight, not a lot, but more than I would’ve liked but it was because I was hungry ALL of the time and all I wanted to eat was junk food. But I have finally been able to control it.

I could not get any help from my HMO; they refused to say it was the implant. I decided to have it removed just short of six months. The weight loss stopped but the damage was done. The 40 pound loss triggered two rare syndromes called SMA and Nutcracker. I have a rough road ahead of me.,Kitten

My hair became very brittle to the point I had to cut it short to blend in the breakage.

Every time my partner would thrust it felt like he was hitting my IUD. My sex drive also decreased, sex didn’t even feel good anymore. My partner kept complaining about the strings stabbing him so it was a turn off for both of us. MY doctor told me  it’s better to leave the strings long so they can pull it out easier and the strings should soften up over the months. So I got the IUD removed which was easier then getting it inserted. Since then all complications disappeared.

I asked my doctor about this and they didn't think it was related to my IUD. I decided to get a tubal ligation last year.  I have had no back pain since. It is a miracle. I can say I'm certain that my back problems came from my IUD's. (I also had major anxiety and panic attacks while I had the Mirena. That is another story.)",WLH

Even so, it was very fast and if Mirena works as I’ve been told I would do it again. I had cramps for 3 days but they were not bad at all. I’m still not very convinced of having it as a birth control because the doctor told my partner and I that It’s possible it could move and end up not working as it’s supposed to. Because of it they have to check it regularly if it’s still in place; so, how can I be comfortable and sure that I will not end up pregnant? I don’t know...

I started as a 38B and I'm now up to a 36DD with those bras even beginning to be too small.

I noticed an increase it appetite, but no weight gain since I stuck to eating healthy and exercising. However, my hair thinned out tremendously which is I’m getting it removed.

First off to start off positive, it prevented pregnancy and lightened my periods as it promises BUT, after the first year I had chronic yeast infections and bacterial vaginosis which caused odor and discomfort, than to treat these I had to take antibiotics that caused yeast infections etc it was just just a mess. After 2 years on this birth control I gained 30 pounds and even with healthy eating and exercise I couldn’t shake the weight. I also dealt with depression, low self esteem and extreme anxiety. I had it removed today and I’m hoping to see changes. But everyone’s body is different what works for one may not work for the either.",Anonymous

Positive effects: Not pregnant, I have only had my period twice in 8 months and they are very light (no menstrual products needed, just pink when wipe). Negative effects: Acne - I started noticing more acne after about 4 months. It was not cystic but there is a lot of blackheads, under the surface pimples and some deep pimples. It started getting better after about 6-7 months and now is slowly continuing to improve. Cramps - I did not have cramps during my period before but now I do. They are not severe but they are noticeable.I had no weight gain. I have noticed maybe a small improvement in sex drive and enjoyment of sex. No negative mood effects and, if anything, it may have improved anxiety a little.Overall, I am very happy with my kyleena and if it weren't for the moderate acne, would have given a 10/10.",Kelly

Overall, I really liked this IUD. I didn’t gain any weight and didn’t experience any increase in acne (although it didn’t improve either).

We never used condoms once (he did pull out) so that was a huge bonus! I never had to remember to take the pill or change the patch which was fantastic for me because I forget things easily. I believe that it definitely helped with my acne. I have PCOS so I get bad acne on my chin and cheeks. Hormonal acne is so hard to get rid of without any medication or creams prescribed by a doctor. So that was awesome! Cons; constant bacterial vaginosis and yeast infections, pain during sex, pain in general",A

I began having 14 day heavy periods with cramps that would take my breath away because they were so painful. I was also experiencing major mood swings towards the end of the year.

My emotions are more challenging to rein in. I do get ovulation pain. I thought that an IUD would level out the hormones and make my emotions easier to manage. I had an IUD on Friday 09/27/2019. I spent 24 hours in cramping pain and tiredness. Lots of brown discharge in the first day. The progestin made me bloated/gassy. Saturday and Sunday I felt in a brain fog and couldn't think clearly or just enjoy being (just like when I was on micronor). I was very much aware of the device and pressure in my uterus.

It has been out for ~ 2 weeks and my mood is better, sex drive up, pelvic pain gone. I stopped the spirolactone and my skin has been fine. I also want to note that while inserted, I occasionally experienced foul odor and vaginal discharge that hasn't been an issue since removal either.

My skin started acting up a little bit in that first month but now in my second month; the bleeding has stopped and my skin has improved. I would advise that young girls get one of these as it makes life easier with not getting your period and having that inconvenience, it prevents pregnancy and it doesn’t change your diet that much.

I only have light spotting once a month with Mirena and no cramps. Mirena lasts longer, which is nicer.

The issue with the IUD is that it is designed to be out of sight. So, if you have other stressors in your life you will look to those before you think about the IUD you put in a year ago. Many of the studies I searched said there wasn't a correlation to depression, but the results from those studies have been invalidated by peer reviews because of the method they used to track their subjects (mostly just self-reported, or reported uses of anti-depressant) So, if you couldn't muster up energy to contact the clinic that you got your IUD in 6 months prior or didn't get to the point to be put on antidepressants, they would count that as asymptomatic. If you are getting an implanted form of birth control that is design to be ""out of sight of mind"" remember to check in to think how birth control has changed your mental or physical health over that time.",issa

My headaches have completely stopped and I never had another migraine after getting my Liletta.         I have a longer cycle (not bleeding days) and get worse cramping than I've had before.

1095,Levonorgestrel,Birth Control,8.0,,"July 18, 2019",6,Mirena (levonorgestrel):This will be my 4th Mirena. First was for birth control and was good. The insertion was a bit painful . The first was for contraception and I didn't have periods during five years. I did feel a bit moody on the first year. When  expired I had it removed and fitted a new one on the same day.. All was well for two years when I started bleeding after intercourse. The Mirena had moved and couldn't be found so I had to have it removed by hysteroscopy day surgery. I bled heavily for months after that but it could also be because I have fibroids and on the peri-menopause. The excessive bleeding has been going on for 2 years and the doctor recommended the Mirena again but I was  unsure  Went ahead anyway because the options to reduce the bleeding was taking hormones orally or having my uterus removed . 3 months had Mirena inserted but it came out after 3 days. Yesterday had it put in. Fingers crossed that will stay in and sort the heavy bleeding. I will come back  let you know how it goes.,Mina

I was sweaty, I puked, & nearly passed out. The first month had lots of cramping, but it wasn’t too unbearable. Overall I like the Kyleena as my birth control because it isn’t something I have to worry about too often. My periods of stopped completely. I just get some light spotting a couple times a month. My only complaints would just be that it has caused me to have lots of mood swings and depression & anxiety issues, and  I’ve ended up gaining some weight, but that could be my own fault unless the birth control makes my appetite increase a lot.",jordan
1097,Levonorgestrel,Birth Control,9.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"July 17, 2019",1,Kyleena (levonorgestrel):Just got Kyleena inserted yesterday and TBH so far it’s been pretty good. My gyno discovered I had an extremely tight cervix (super super rare and she’s never seen this before) so insertion was almost impossible even with the dilation medication. But after maybe 30 seconds of pain we managed to get it in. Minor cramping for maybe 30 mins only bled for a few hours since it was the last day of my period and so far everything is going great. Just a heads up if you go into it too stressed out your body will react and it will be more painful. Just relax and take a lot of pain medication and everything will be alright!,Medstudent

I was literally so nervous going in because I work at a gyneoclogist office and I know a lot of people don't handle insertion very well. My doctor talked me through the entire process. First the tenaculum which is an instrument to hold your cervix in place, she told me to cough as she was clamping it and I didn't even feel it go on.  Then she used a ""sound"" to measure where she needed to insert the IUD. The sound felt very crampy and quite a bit of pressure but was not unbearable. As soon as she was finished measuring she inserted the IUD and cut the strings. I literally didn't even know the IUD was in because I didn't feel anything. I have only had a little bit of spotting when I use the restroom. Knowing this is good for 5 years and I don't have to remember to take it every day I would get it all over again. Such an easy process and I got myself worked up for something I barely felt. In my opinion the speculum hurt worse than the entire procedure.",Mother of 2

The only complaint I have is of course the discomfort during the procedure and cramps for the first day, but that's it. My period stopped immediately and hasn't returned, and honestly it's one of the best things that has happened to me.  I don't like that there is something artificial inside my body but I'm definitely not having kids! I never have to remember to take a pill, it has never made me feel sick, given me cramps, bleeding, nothing.

I was super scared to get the IUD, because the insertion hurts. The insertion wasn’t as bad for me. I took 800 mg of ibuprofen about 30 minutes before, I also got my period (not expected). She said I will feel 3 cramps. The 1st is when she cleaned around my cervix, the 2nd is when she measures it,  and the 3rd is when she puts the IUD. Honestly, it wasn’t as bad as I thought. I felt the 1st cramp and it was a level 2 pain out of 10 (more like a discomfort), I also felt the 2nd cramp and it was a level 3 (more like a discomfort), the 3rd cramp I didn’t even feel. Next thing I knew she was done. I did have cramps right after, and so I just rested. I took a nap, and now I feel perfectly fine!

My doctor suggested keeping it in, as it sometimes takes a while for your body to get used to it. The constant pain stopped mid-December, but my periods continue to be 17 days long. Additionally, it never removed my excruciating cramps during my periods, nor did it actually lessen the pain in any way. I still get bloated and nauseous as well. Originally, it had at least stopped the bleeding, but now that's coming back as of the past two months. I'd have it removed, but I'm honestly afraid of being incapacitated for another month.

I had cramping for 5 min, and then nothing! Didn't get any cramps until I got my period 2 weeks later.

This Skyla IUD was one of the most painful things that I’ve ever endured. I got it in high school and for the first three months, my hormones were scattered, my cramps were debilitating, and I was constantly bleeding. While the cramping eventually lightened up, it never truly went away until I got my IUD removed some two years later. I would never recommend this to anyone. Everyday for the entire two years there was either some spotting or some cramping. A side effect that no one tells you about — the smell. It was so awful, especially after my period. Many women have had similar experiences as me, in fact every woman I know who had gotten an IUD has gotten it out due to the constant pain and the smell.

Ever since it’s been inserted, I’ve pretty much had light spotting to actual bleeding.

When I came to, I was confused, sweating profusely, and in so much pain,  the doctor and nurse were staring at me terrified and called the paramedics. The doctor immediately removed it and the symptoms started to subside. I was still in pain for the next day. I am told it was a vagus nerve reaction due to pain and anxiety maybe?

Drove home. Forgot about it a day later. Only light spotting and no other side effects. 3 weeks post insertion, I'm feeling so great!Trust YOUR body and don't comparing it to anyone else's and ""what could be.""

Given, the week afterward I had pretty consistent cramping, but it wasn’t unbearable. My first period afterward was heavier than usual, but now they’re back to normal. Generally, the side effects stopped after about a month. The one thing I didn’t anticipate was how badly I broke out in acne after I went off birth control. It makes sense why, but I think it flared up worse because I’d abruptly ceased oral birth control. However, now my skin’s fine and I mostly don’t even know Skyla’s there!",Mir

Verified again a week later.January 2019 went to the gyno for a reoccurring yeast infection. Told her that I had been unable to locate IUD strings for a time. (None of my doctors EVER told me to check for my strings. Google did.)  She couldn't find them and booked an ultrasound for a few days later. Unable to locate Liletta during ultrasound.She recommends new BC assuming expulsion. I didn't agree and she said I could have an x-ray for confirmation.X-rayed a week later and it was located in my pelvic region.

Just a little bit of acne on my chin/jawline, but nothing extreme.

I used birth control pills previous to having Kyleena and I was absolutely miserable.

In fact, high blood pressure is the main reason my doctor encouraged me to switch to an IUD. One month in and I feel like a new woman!

I was screaming and moaning uncontrollably it was so painful (actually quite embarrassing but I couldn't help it). I had to call in sick to work for the same day and the following 2 days because I was cramping and bleeding so heavily. The bleeding got worse about a week later and I ended up going to the hospital. The heavy bleeding persisted over about 3 weeks, coupled with major cramping that eventually dwindled down to no cramping at all. I'm now 6 weeks post-insertion and am finally feeling back to normal.

After the first year, I talked with my gyno about different IUD options, because I still liked the fact that I didn't have to think about my birth control for such a long time. She recommended Kyleena because it's tiny and just as effective as Paragard. It was a bit challenging to get my old IUD removed and this one inserted in the same visit, but the last 6 months with Kyleena have been amazing -- no cramping, lighter and more regular periods (I do have a few days of spotting before my period actually starts), and sex is fun again.

I have had my Kyleena for almost two years now and it has been good for me in the long run. The insertion is painful, there is no way around that. But it’s over in ~8 seconds. (I had just barely popped an ibuprofen beforehand and was not prescribed any of the numbing or dilating medication that some doctors will premedicate with)The first few weeks I was very crampy.and needed a pantyliner for the spotting. The first month to two months I was still occasionally crampy and still fairly spotty.From there, my periods tend to have gotten lighter and shorter. However there have been cycles where I feel like I am PMSing for an entire month before my period. Otherwise, I feel more like myself than I have with any other type of birth control.

Ignored it because my sex drive was back and I didn’t have a period (happy about these things) Then did some looking into it & truly realized how horrible hormonal bc is for your body. Kyleena specifically is linked to miscarriages & the inability to get pregnant after removal. Not worth it anymore. Getting it taken out & switching to Paragard. As soon as I made the decision to switch (2 weeks before my 1 year mark), I started heavily bleeding. Haven’t stopped since. I’ve had a 2 week period after a year of no period. So bye bye kyleena!

The insertion of it definitely didn't feel good, but I wouldn't say that it was excruciating. The gyno had me take ibuprofen before, so I am sure that helped with any post pain considering I didn't have any. My main complaint about Kyleena is the fact that it has given me acne on my face, back, upper chest, neck, and ass cheeks. I have NEVER had acne like this before and I absolutely hate it. It seems that it makes me have a lot more oily skin than before and I'm assuming that's the cause. Before I got this I had pretty dry skin and now its combination. This side effect alone has me considering removing the iud. I am very fair skinned and had fairly clear skin before this and now I have acne 24/7 and its leaving scars.

My experience with kyleena so far is really positive! I was annoyed at first at the bleeding for a month or so, but now it's pretty much gone. I haven't experienced changes in mood, weight, acne (it may have only helped my skin), libido, or anything really. I forget about it honestly, and my partner doesn't feel it. I prefer the IUD because the hormones needed to prevent pregnancy are being localized & emitted where it needs to be in the uterus, and a smaller dose travels through your whole bloodstream, where as when you take a pill, the hormones/drug are going everywhere essentially.

I already have lighter periods since I have PCOS. I have returned to normal activity after 6 days of rest. My spotting/period also stopped 7 days after insertion.

I experienced a ruptured ovarian cyst, and another extremely large ovarian cyst, both due to the progesterone in Kyleena. (Resulting in IUD removal). Was it worth it? I enjoyed the intimacy with my partner and not having to worry about pregnancy or taking a pill at a specific time each day. Once I got through month 1, the rest of the cramping was bearable and made it all worth it. Plus, the IUD was the only method I could use due to intolerance for other birth-control. However, I would not want to go through the pain I had twice. I wouldn’t get the IUD again. People I know have IUDs and love them, so it depends. If you’re on the fence about it, get it.

The only plus side is not having to worry about popping up pregnant but it doesn’t outweigh the worry of what it’s actually doing to my body. This is just not natural and I don’t like it.",Kayles

Taking 4 Advil tablets before the procedure aided me, I think.On the day of insertion, many hours later, I was cramping, but not any more than the average period cramp.Now this is where things went awry- when I got my next period a few days after the insertion, it was the WORST period of my life. The pain was excruciating- and the bleeding was heavy. My period also lasted for two weeks or so. This is normal.I am an acne-prone gal, but don’t be discouraged- my skin has not suffered from breakouts any worse than usual. As for the weight gain... it’s been more like a weight loss for me. I am 5’9 and when I got my Kyleena inserted, I was 156 pounds. Now I am 135 pounds months later, without a significant change to my diet or any health issues.

Every month I get the most god awful cramps and my breasts get so sore and sensitive I can’t even wear a bra on those days. I experience extreme mood swings that my boyfriend can confirm (poor guy), I get waves of depression quite often and I have gained 20 pounds since being on Kyleena. I work out religiously and maintain a healthy diet, but I still gained a lot of weight. This is by far my worst experience on birth control, really debating on getting it removed soon.

Over the years I've tried four types of pill, and a copper coil, and they were all terrible in their own special ways.

I've had Skyla (or Jaydess) for a bit more than three months now and it's been great. The downsides are that I have experienced quite a lot of spotting (although it seems to have stopped now!), a few painful cramps, and I think my moods have been a bit more up and down than before. But there are more upsides:  I have, if anything, a higher sex drive than normal, and when I say my moods are more up and down I mean in a manageable way as opposed to uncontrollably crying on the pill.

I definitely don’t think it was comfortable, but it also was in no way unbearable. I’ve never had children so I’m sure my cervix was a little less pliable in general. Cramping is most severe for the first 5 minutes post insertion, and then starts dissipating altogether after about 2.5 hours. Ibuprofen helps and I took 0.25 mg of Xanax prior which I think helped me a lot with relaxing. Bottom line, it is probably not wise to reading all these reviews about worst pain of my life etc, as these only made me anxious.

I think worse because it doesn’t go away. I had nausea and had to stop the ob-gyn at times to take a breath. All day I’ve had the worst cramps of my life. They are unending. Nothing is helping with the pain. I would never recommend this product to anyone who could use something like the Nuva ring, in my opinion the best contraceptive. Not to mention for Kyleena insertion you get nothing to help with the pain; it seems unconscionable. No way I can sleep tonight like this.

I did have pretty heavy mood swings 2 days per month but they were regular, so I knew how to monitor and alleviate them. Removal was fine, too, and felt like a general pap smear. I did get Kyleena inserted today, immediately after the Skyla removal, because Kyleena is the same hormones and dosages but just last 5 years instead of 3.

I stopped bleeding but during that time of my suppose period I get bad cramps and a really foul smell. Also, my acne is bad I have never experienced bad skin until now.  My mood swings are unexpected and frequently.  I'm giving it another month perhaps my body needs more time to get used to it but so far it has been a bad experience.",Natalie

I had my last baby in July 2017 and I lost a lot of weight after I had her and continued to lose weight up until the insertion of the IUD. If you are very sensitive to birth control as of I am I would recommend the good old condoms. I feel like the IUD has made me go emotionally crazy and experienced a lot of weight gain. I had the depo shot in 2015 and it was far worse than Skyla. I had experienced a lot of weight gain and I was hormonally  off balance severely.

However the cramps that followed were UNBEARABLE and nonstop for about 10 hours after. The next day I was fine cramp wise, but starting then began to bleed lightly nonstop for about 6 weeks. After this, no period at all. At first I thought all was well but then began to experience pretty severe depression symptoms. Going to have it removed ASAP because I can’t stand feeling this way.

The insertion wasn't painful at all, and the recovery time was very minimal (probably like a day but I got it on a Friday so I took the whole weekend to relax). My periods are non existent but sometimes I get spotting with mild cramping for a few days before it goes away, but the cramping is much more tolerable than when I wasn't on any birth control at all and felt like dying whenever I was on my period. It's given me a little bit of acne on my chin but really not anything super noticeable. I haven't had any ""accidents"" unlike when I was on the pill. My partner says he does not feel it in me either so that's a big plus too. It also hasn't messed with my emotions either which was a big problem when I was on the shot and it amped up my depression/anxiety making me borderline suicidal.

Everyone is different but you have to find what can help keep you calm when your body is literally screaming at you & at the doc. After the insertion, do not try to sit up!

I've also had dizzy spells, bloating, constipation, and a few cystic pimples but no full-on breakouts. I am due for my period this week but have not had ANY bleeding since insertion. I go for ultrasound to check the positioning at next week. If the cramping doesn't improve within the next few months, I might have it removed.

I stopped because I was gaining a lot of weight and my acne was worsening from the oral contraceptive. The insertion process was painful but bearable, really similar to a really intense menstrual cramp, however, I took two extra strong Advil’s beforehand. The first month I did experience spotting practically everyday. It was coupled with mild cramps and it was pretty annoying. The last month though the spotting stopped, my period was super light and I didn’t have any pain. I’m also not experiencing any symptoms of weight gain or acne at all. I feel so much better than I did before! I did have a very painful yeast infection and my doctor told me it’s probably a side effect from the IUD. That was a downside. However I’d recommend the IUD as it is a long term commitment and requires no upkeep -do your research beforehand though!",Pam

I had terrible cramping for about 2 weeks afterwards and my cervix continued to be sensitive for about 3 months after insertion making me unable to have sex without severe discomfort. After this, I didn't have much issue for a few months and was happy with the IUD other than occasional cramping when I was supposed to have my usual period. I had minor spotting but never had an actual period after having my IUD inserted. About 4 months ago, I began having severe pain almost constantly on the left side of my body (lower back, pelvis, leg, ankle, etc.). When talking to my gyno about it, he sent me for internal and external ultrasounds which came out normal. My doctor put me on antibiotics and two anti-inflammatory medications for 3 weeks and hoped it would clear up. After that round of meds, my pain wasn't as constant and I was able to have sex with only minor discomfort. Now my chronic pain is back and in full force. Some days I can barely walk and I am essentially living in anticipation to take my next dose of pain relief because it barely works anymore. My gyno still doesn't have any idea what it could be except for my IUD not reacting well with my body (which he claims he's never heard of) so he suggested me having it removed. After further research, it seems that younger women without children are prone to pains such as this, which had never been mentioned to me. My doctor continues to tell me that my pain and experience is very rare and that he isn't sure why it's happening but with a little more research, I've heard about many people having an experience typical to this but being told it ""wasn't the IUD"". I'm hoping that once it's removed (my doctor has scheduled me to get it removed a month and a half from now, ugh) that this chronic pain will go away and I will be able to function normally again.

The insertion was worse than usual since I was not on my period at the time and had Skyla removed and then had kyleena inserted. It’s a lot of pressure and a big pinch. After kyleena was inserted I got a week-long period. With both IUDs my periods were heavy flows with normal cramping. Some weird side effects of kyleena was the cystic acne. I have never had this before. I have not had major cramping and I have had semi-normal periods.

Insertion was nothing, just had some moderate cramps the day of, not unlike a bad menstrual cramp. I had some more moderate cramping and spotting for about two months then everything was awesome! No period, very mild weight gain, no mood swings and no pregnancy! About 5 months ago though, I started having pretty severe pelvic pain. I finally saw a doc last month who prescribed antibiotics for PID but that didn’t help. I got an ultrasound and turns out I have two uterine fibroids and one ovarian cyst, all benign.

After I had some cramping and took my time getting up. Then no issues at all! So far I have some regular period type cramps at night when I’m not moving around much before I go to bed, but when I’m active I feel nothing.

After a few weeks of minor spotting and bleeding (no heavier than my normal period) the bleeding stopped. After a month, I experienced no further bleeding which is great.

They continued throughout the rest of the day and were horrible. However, I have never had period cramps before this so I think I’ve been hyper sensitive to them. The next day I was fine and had no cramps for a week. After a week I would randomly get sharp cramps but I’ve had no spotting. I rarely get cramps now. My only real complaint is that I did get a bad yeast infection after insertion. All in all, insertion hurts and you may have to deal with being slightly uncomfortable for a bit while your body adjusts, but it’s well worth it to be in control of body!",Emma

Apparently I have a ""curvy cervix "". I went back 4 days later with a full bladder and pain meds and NSAID on board. We went straight to ultrasound this time and she spent 45 minutes to successfully implant it. Pain on day 2 was not so bad since I had pain meds in me. It's been 4 weeks now and I've bleed every day of that....some days heavy other days spotty. I hope it evens out soon however when I was on the depo shot I bled for 7 months straight before my period disappeared.I'm happy I have it because it's one less thing to worry a out but I do want to caution people out there that the insertion process may not be as quick and easier as others have experienced.",Anonymous

You feel a pinch when the device enters the uterus, after that there’s a really painful cramp. The cramp feels similar to a mini contraction. The pain only last for a few seconds. It was all worth it. I don’t have to worry about taking a pill every day or getting a shot every 3 months. The side effects that you read on the internet are generalized. The information that you find is basically talking about all progestin birth control. Not the IUD specifically. The IUD mainly effects the uterus (not in a bad way) Other methods like the pill and the shot can effect several parts of the body. A good example would be calcium depletion with longterm use of Depo. When on any form of birth control I suggest taking a probiotic daily to prevent a yeast infection and to prevent BV.

Having it placed was very painful, and I did feel a little faint for about 5 minutes after it was placed. I cramped pretty badly for the first week so used ibuprofen around the clock per my physician's recommendation (still plenty of cramps despite that) until I was worried my stomach couldn't take ibuprofen anymore, then I slowed down taking them. The cramping lessened after about 3 months, but I still cramped significantly for several hours a day 6-7 days a week. I gave it a year, then decided I didn't want to live like that anymore.

Also: don't get it put in my just anyone. Get someone who has done this a lot. If you do that, it will be inserted relatively easily and definitely correctly. My experience has been pretty good! I am still spotting and cramping, but I'm still in the adjustment period, so it should subside after around 4 months max.

I never had bad cramping with mirena, but with this IUD I have to breathe through some of the cramps due to their intensity. It didn't give me much trouble when it was inserted, so if the focus of your concern is on this type of pain, you have less to consider. The jury is still out for me on this IUD.

I’ll be honest, the cramps the day of were enough to make me sit down and I think I cried. After the second day, I only got an occasional bad cramp maybe once every three days for the next two weeks. I spotted for about two months and I’ve noticed it’s starting to reduce a bit. My periods are notably lighter, lasting maybe two days. The only drawback has been the brown discharge that happens every time I have sex. It’s not major but it’s embarrassing, but most times it’s too lightly colored and not very much there so my boyfriend doesn’t see.

When I ended up getting my first IUD in I was having a good experience until I realized that the IUD was expelling and was half way in me. I had to have it removed and I decided to try again. As well as I had had the first one for about 8 months. Now with this second one I am going in for my one month check up and it has either expelled or is absorbed in my uterus. We will find out tomorrow 8/23. I unfortunately was one of the unlucky few who the IUD expelled. I had primarily used this to not have any babies in that case the IUD did it's job. Will be looking at other options like the nexplanon if this does not work. Really wanted to love this type of birth control but just not for me.,History123

After reading all of the negative reviews regarding a painful insertion, I was scared of absolutely nothing. I would cry thinking about how painful it was going to be while reading horror stories of people passing out, bleeding their guts out, and blinding pain. While I was on the table getting my insertion, yes, I cried. But not because of the pain. It was because of the pain I expected. I felt nothing but a pinch, and I have a low pain tolerance. I took 4 Advil tablets an hour before my procedure, and a couple hours after my procedure, the bad cramps have yet to come. I cannot speak upon Kyleena’s long-term results, but my review is just based on insertion. Please don’t be scared. I was, and I was scared over nothing.",Kate
1815,Levonorgestrel,Birth Control,5.0,,"August 20, 2018",2,Kyleena (levonorgestrel):I got my Kyleena June 14th 2018. I started bleeding two weeks after insertion. Insertion felt like contractions and I had to lay in bed for the day. I still have a normal sex drive. It cured my dry skin and no acne. I also dropped 3 pounds in a month. I started bleeding June 27 and stopped bleeding Aug 17. At the beginning I was bleeding enough to count it as a period. The next 2 weeks were casual amounts of light period. It was enough to switch out a liner twice or three times a day. Then there was a week of only one liner a day. Then there was a week or so of only bleeding when using the bathroom. I naturally have bouts of severe depression and generalized anxiety. After taking Kyleena I've noticed that the depression comes in shorter terms. Where I used to have 3-4 months of depression now it hits for a week and then fade. My anxiety got a little worse but manageable. If you're still hurting 3 months in it is time to go get a check up to make sure it's in the right position.,Jen

After that cramping was only during my period or after sex. I thought something was wrong but after an exam and ultrasound I was cleared as just sensitive and to give it time. 2 more months passed and sex doesn’t hurt as bad although I have to be careful. My period cramps calmed down a bit and are about as bad as they were before getting the IUD (I’ve always struggled with painful periods) and bleeding is light but lasts 2 weeks.

The day I got it in (Monday) I couldn't get out of bed for around 5 hours after as it was just serious cramping which is normal and is your body adjusting, Day two was normal period like cramps and slight discharge.

I will not lie to you the cramps the next few days were really really bad. My 1st period post insertion was 2 weeks long and my mood was awful.  My 2nd period after my insertion I didn’t have any mood swings and the cramping was normal. As the months go by the side effects become less and less so I think honestly it’s worth it.

I researched a lot about all the different types of IUDs and myself and my gyno both agreed Kyleena was the best choices, as it is the thinnest and best if you haven’t had kids (which I have not). The insertion was not difficult and was about 3 minutes long, it felt like you just got hit with really bad cramps and that lasts for about 1-2 hours after insertion and then slowly dies down. An IUD was right for me because I’m in my 20s and remembering to take the pill everyday was too difficult and condoms aren’t ALWAYS available.

We are a week out and I still get random contractions that take my breath away for about 30 seconds to a minute throughout the day.

She also was quick and very gentle. The process of getting them in is you take medication to dilate your cervix, you also do the placement during your period. Once there they open everything up spray a topical numbing agent and then measure and place. It didn’t take long and it was crampy and hurt a little during placement it subsided in a minute.

It felt like getting poked up there with something really pointy (they had to use a plier- like object to stretch and measure my cervix), and then she inserted the IUD, which also hurt. Long story short- I screamed. Like yelled bloody murder. But overall the entire process took about 5-10 minutes, I had cramps for maybe 5-10 minutes after that and it’s been about three or so hours.

The cramps were so much worse. And insertion took about 15 minutes and was quite painful. Which I think is because I have never had a child.

But I didn’t know that it took away your sex drive almost completely. When my husband and I are intimate, if he goes too far back it feels as if I’m being stabbed in the cervix. It feels like he’s pulling on the actual IUD. My OBGYN has checked on it twice with a sonogram but nothing is out of place. I’ve never had any other issues and it’s obviously extremely effective birth control, but the lack of sex drive and pain during intercourse has made me seriously consider going back on the pill.

Like intense, bad cramps for about 5-10 seconds. Unfortunately, I was one of the rare cases that developed an ectopic pregnancy while using Liletta.

By March my cramps were gone and so was most of my spotting. I checked my strings pretty frequently and got checked at the doctor twice just so they saw the strings but ladies DON'T freak out over the length of the strings. My periods are on time + 1 day, and I have noticed they’ve gotten longer (7 days) but lighter blood flow. Don’t get the Skyla if you get unsettled easily about your body experiencing unexpected and more persistent things like cramps or spotting. If those things don’t bother you that much, definitely get an IUD.",LH95

Mine felt like a mild cramp when they measured my uterus, but the insertion was absolutely painless for me. Everyones bodies are different, my uterus was measured before and my doctor said it was 10cm long. So I guess it’s big compared to average size. Don’t let other peoples story change your decision.

I also have endometriosis so the cramps were nothing new to me. Took about 3 days altogether for the cramps to go away completely and now I forget it's there. Do have spotting still but nothing that a panty liner can't handle. I wanted an IUD after practicing Natural Family Planning for a year because it's much easier and more reliable for me.

After some research I’ve come to the conclusion that I am having an allergic reaction to the device or the levonorgestrel. The pain, swelling, itching, mucousy discharge have been insane. Yeast meds are not working and pads/tampons are a no go because it makes everything so much worse. Have been wearing skirts only for 2 weeks now.

It halfway expelled so I got it removed altogether and got the Nexplanon implant instead and as already 1 month in and happy with it. The IUD did lessen my period cramps. If it weren’t for the expulsion, I would have rated it a 10, but however I was that small percent. I URGE YOU TO CONSTANTLY CHECK THE STRINGS PLEASE.

My boyfriend felt the strings during sex - he described it as a needle-like sensation and was even cut a few times from the strings. If you feel the strings DO NOT CUT THEM!!!  This can make it worse and even make the removal process a nightmare. I it removed today and my gyno could not find the strings... it took her about 15 minutes and a sonogram to fish the IUD out. Luckily, she was able to catch them, or I would have needed surgery (this is something I was never warned about).  My skin definitely changed and I even started to breakout a bit on my back.

It started off fine like a Pap smear so I was calm then the insertion started but my body automatically tensed up. Like I said I’ve never been pregnant so I don’t know what giving birth feels like but...the doctor finally got the Skyla in after three tries and that last try was the worst cuz when she removed the some of the equipment I immediately passed out from the pain. I woke up dizzy and in sweats and then was nauseous so I threw up a bit but I finally got it together but my boyfriend had to come pick me up cuz I could not drive home.

I was crampy the rest of the day and several days afterwards, and bled lightly for about a week. I spotted on and off for the first 2-3mos, and have had two mini periods in the last 6 mos. The only side effects I’ve had are painful breasts for a week or so every month, and occasional cramping on my left side around my ovary; my dr thinks these things could be related to ovulation. I’ve struggled with hormonal acne my whole adult life, and it hasn’t gotten better or worse since getting Liletta.

This happened until about 2 years in, then my period basically stopped completely. I had the Skyla replaced in January, and it went so much smoother. I knew what to expect, and I came prepared. But honestly, it was painful for about 15 minutes, then I got up and went to the grocery store. I spotted a little the first day, but I've had absolutely no cramping since the first day, and don't get a period anymore.

First of all, the insertion hurt for me, especially the part when she measured my cervix, so I'd definitely recommend requesting the day of insertion off from work, because I felt quite crampy and lightheaded afterwards. Unfortunately thus far the cons have been outweighing the pros in terms of having it. The pros are not having to worry about an unwanted pregnancy, which is nice! My boyfriend has never complained about the strings either. The cons are very long, heavy periods. I'm not talking spotting, but a decent amount of bleeding that leaves me feeling exhausted. I've also experienced a massive breakout before I got my period all over my forehead, chest, back, etc. Before I was on Skyla, I used to get an occasional breakout on my chin before I got my period, but nothing this bad. I'm hoping my periods will lighten and my hormones will balance out if I wait it out. But if things aren't improving in a few months, I think I'll take my Skyla out.",Sabina711

I never had acne issues growing up so this is a first for me. The cystic acne flares up frequently and leaves scars when they disappear. I have not seen a dermatologist for this but plan on going back to Nuvaring. I already have very dry sensitive skin and don’t need cystic acne to add to my list. If it wasn’t for the cystic acne I’d be 100% happy with the IUD.,.....Anonymous.....

And then bam. Worst 3 weeks ever. The bleeding was so heavy & constant, I could barely keep up with changing my pads (no tampons the first month w IUD!). My cramps ranged from uncomfortable bloating with sharp pains if I used my abdomen muscles, I had literal contractions writhing in pain. I contemplated going to the ER multiple times. Sitting (the motion of rising or coming onto the chair) was so painful for my ab muscles that I opted to stand a lot more. Intercourse was so extremely painful, my breasts became tender and dropped a cup size. I gained some stomach pudge, and lost some tone to my legs (because I couldn't work out + holiday eating?). Horrendous break outs on my chest and back. And then just as quickly as it all came, it's disappeared. Entering 4th week, after what I'm guessing was an early period, the blood loss is actually ""spotting"" amounts, I have no pain at all (regular life, intercourse, sitting etc.) except my lower ab muscles still cannot be used due to sharp pain.

I knew it was going to hurt a little bit but I have a high pain tolerance so I figured I would be okay. This has to be one of the most painful things I have ever experienced. I have not had a child so mind you my cervix was very very tight. The process of measuring and getting an IUD in you should only take 3 or 4 minutes but this took well close to 10 minutes and incredibly painful. I had work right after (how wise of me to get this done before work) and I work as a server so a lot of bending and hustling around is required. Every time iIbent my torso I had a really bad pain.

Bleeding after was heavy and lasted about 3 weeks. I have had moderately heavy, long lasting periods ever since. My biggest complaint is that my skin and hair are super oily now. I can wash my face and 10 min later it is just as oily as before. I used to be able to wash my hair every 3 days, but it needs it daily now and I just cannot do that.
