0,Jolivette,Birth Control,10.0,Taken for 10 years or more,"October 5, 2021",1,I was on Jolivette for 14 years and loved it! I started it after my 3rd child because I was breastfeeding. I’ve tried estrogen and combination pills before but felt moody ace experienced weight gain so even after I finished breastfeeding the doctor recommended that I get off jolivette and get on something more stronger but I’ve even skipped a day here and there and doubled up and never got pregnant the entire time so jolivette was super effective and I had no side effects whatsoever taking it! I hate that they discontinued this brand that’s the only reason I was forced off it however I’ll be finding a progestin only substitute soon!,Lindy
1,Jolivette,Birth Control,2.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"February 11, 2021",1,"I switched to Jolivette from Ortho-tricyclen because of the side effects, my PCP recommended a progesterone only pill to help with these. I became HORRIBLY depressed to the point that I was actually suicidal. I stuck to it for two months because I knew that most side effects go away by the end of the third month, but I couldn't deal with the fallout from this pill. I ended a relationship and I would cry in clinic, I felt so lost and alone, like taking this pill made me feel like I was separate from everyone else. It also made me a bottomless pit, I was always starving and gained a bit of weight. I also had a period every two weeks, not spotting, a full blown period. Got off the pill and within the week felt better. It was like the sun started shining again.This pill work for some, but if you find yourself suicidal  when taking this, get off of it!",Dr. Doctor

I looked up the side effects and itching and rash were on the list. The first day I took the pill I saw a faint hint of pink after going to the bathroom. And I also started this pill after my cycle went off. I'm discontinuing this pill today because the itching is unbearable!",Ash7

4,Jolivette,Birth Control,2.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"September 9, 2019",5,"Major weight gain! Holy heck!! Want to know how bad it was? There happened to be a lapse in my refill of this medication. I could not get it for almost 3 weeks. I lost almost 15 pounds. Started taking it again - boom. Weight is back.  It seems so hard to believe that the 0.35mg I am on  causes so much hassle.  Side effects at the beginning were so bad I thought I was going insane. Massive mood swings, my breasts hurt so bad I thought I was going to die of boob-pain, back pain, horrible weight gain...I could go on and on! Also, got pregnant on this medicine even of perfect use in the first 6 months of taking this medication despite my husband ""pulling out"" and suffered a miscarriage. I literally had no clue I was pregnant until that happened! SCARY!   I've been on all the other brand names of this medicine Errin (discontinued?) and Heather - but Jolivette is the WORST!!",Kat
5,Jolivette,Birth Control,4.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"September 9, 2019",5,"I started this pill 7 weeks after having my daughter because I was breastfeeding. Did not notice a decrease in my supply. I have been taking it for 10 months. I've been suffering from postpartum depression and recently stopped taking the pill. I can tell a huge difference and it has been 2 weeks.  Now that I think about it and read all these experiences, I see a lot of similarities. I’ve had horrible anxiety and depression, it’s been hard to lose weight! And I have experienced hair loss.

6,Jolivette,Birth Control,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"September 4, 2019",4,"I started this pill ten days ago. I gave birth seven weeks ago. My milk supply was low to begin with, I am barely getting one feeding in after 8 days of this BC. I struggle with mild anxiety and depression pretty rarely however the last two days I have wanted to just cry and I felt detached from my children and husband. I have been anxious and I don’t know why. I have been an endless pit for food, I feel that I can not eat enough and I also started to get a break out of pimples on my forehead(I have never had acne) after calling my husband crying and telling him I had been sleeping majority of the day and crying we decided it was best to stop the medication immediately. This was my experience with the medication, I can not wait it out and hope it gets better. I do not want to spend my precious maternity leave feeling detached from my NB and depressed/anxious.",Kathryn

8,Jolivette,Birth Control,9.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"July 30, 2019",6,"So far so good! I was previously on Ortho Tri but then swapped to generic version TriNessa and it was horrible!! I had break thru bleeding for like a month then bad headaches and I felt like I was going insane with my moods and feelings. I asked gyno to switch me to something not so hardcore and she prescribed Jolivette. Its been  great!  No break thru bleeding, slight headache (once in a while) bigger  boobs and, sometimes  I break out. Other than that I’m doing ok on this pill. I started taking it mid June and I’m on my second pack so I hope it continues to be the same all year. You have to remember to take it at the same time every day, set an alarm because it will not work if you’re late.",Lilu

I was then switched to Jolivette and have had no horrible side effects.  I have noticed I haven’t really been able to lose the weight gained from my previous pill but that’s the only downside.

10,Jolivette,Birth Control,7.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"April 9, 2019",2,"Jolivette pill is pretty good. I take it mainly due to the fact I can get migraines and its safer to take a non combo pill.  My period is not as bad on this pill and the side effects aren't too bad. Small weight gain and increase in breast size, some irritability but not too bad. It does help with my headaches and is effective in preventing pregnancy. You just need to be careful to take it at or around same time each day/night.",ncgrl77
11,Jolivette,Birth Control,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"December 28, 2018",7,"I was on the brand Ortho Micronor until my insurance company decided not to cover it anymore-- they put me on Jolivette. After about a week of taking this pill I noticed that I was getting horrible anxiety about the smallest little things. By week 2, it was so bad that I was afraid to leave my apartment. Simple tasks such as going out to dinner, or going shopping with friends became very taxing. As someone who has never experience severe anxiety, this was a very scary time. I also knew that this wasn't normal for me. I stopped taking this medication and the panic and anxiety attacks stopped. I will never recommend this pill to anybody as it was one of the most depressing and scary times in my life.",Kelsey

When I would forget with NoraBe, I'd feel meh all day. I have an active 3 year old who I stay at home with. If I'd miss a pill, every little thing she did would stress me out. With Jolivette, if I miss a day or don't take it on time, my family doesn't notice as much. My old non-existent sex drive is gone! I had absolutely no desire do anything. Now, my hormones are all levelled out and I actually find myself initiating which is something I haven't done since before my pregnancy. I don't notice any other side effects besides breakthrough bleeding. I've been taking this for two months and my cycle still isn't on a regular schedule. NoraBe had me menstruating every two weeks. Now Jolivette is causing breakthrough bleeding so I'm never sure if I'm actually starting my period naturally or the breakthrough bleeding is happening when my period should be starting.",HiBP

My mood has changed so much to a point where my anxiety and depression were so bad I thought I was losing my mind. My headaches have increased and I cry a lot. Not normal for me. I also have Hypothyroidism and it actually changed my levels. After reading what other people have gone through I have decided to stop this medication immediately. I seriously thought I was going to end up in the Psych unit!,A.

16,Jolivette,Birth Control,1.0,,"August 17, 2018",3,"I’ve been taking this pill for about six months because of migraines & combo pills were giving me serious depression. When I started it I bled for three weeks. Not spotting, heavy bleeding. They said I’d adjust and finally I did, but my periods became even more irregular, painful, and heavy. Then I noticed that sex was becoming painful, orgasms were even becoming painful! I was super dry down there and irritated, my breasts were always sore, tons of cystic acne, I was getting hot flashes and sweating tons, basically menopause at 22 but still bleeding! And then the final straw: I started getting yeast infections every two weeks like clockwork. Ridiculous. I’d never had any problem like that until I started this medication. I discontinued it one week ago and immediately felt better. Everything is back to normal everywhere and I’ll never take a mini pill again. The only good thing I can think of is an increase in cup size, and that’s not worth it if everything hurts!",HHadley

I have had the worst side effects! I have literally gone completely crazy, had multiple psychotic episodes, I'm shocked my boyfriend is still with me too! I became super depressed, unmotivated, lazy, I was having night sweats so bad I would be soaked when I woke up. Insomnia like crazy. So glad I switched and definitely will never go back on Jolivette !! It literally almost ruined my life.",Mel

24,Jolivette,Birth Control,8.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"November 3, 2017",3,"I started taking Jolivette 5 months ago. First, to all you breastfeeding moms out there, I have had NO decrease in milk supply. And that from a woman who had to supplement with first 2 babies within their first 3 months because of low supply and low weight gain. My 3rd baby is now 5 1/2 months old and still exclusively breastfed and gaining weight beautifully. So it doesn't always affect milk supply.  I've taken different BC pills before and always suffered severe anxiety and depression just before starting my period. I was worried about starting another pill but haven't had any problems yet. My first month on these pills I had a heavy period, but haven't had another one since. I'm pretty happy with these pills",Justanotherwoman

Not only do I get cramps but a strong pain shoots through my left abdominal area. No acne, but I am looking pregnant and feeling bloated! My mood swings are drastic and I'm already emotional enough!

So far it’s been a lot better. My period is trying to get back on track but it’s not too bad. I’m a 3 or 4 months into it I’ve noticed the past few weeks I’ve been very oily (never had that problem in my life. I’ve always had dry skin). Like I’m so oily even my ears are oily. It’s weird lol. Also my body odour is really bad. I’ve never body odour problems. Idk if I’m having womanly changes or if it’s switching to this pill lol. But I’m not pregnant and the migraines are gone so I’m giving this pill time to adjust to my body.,Aliciae10

I have been bleeding ever since I have taken the first day and today I was downright angry and crying  and could not function. All for no reason. I am stopping this pill immediately. I have also been so bloated that I feel like I am pregnant all over again and I was starting to finally feel good about myself again since I had my son 6 weeks ago.

I am a person who has great blood pressure. Immediately after starting I noticed my feet feeling swollen so I started taking my blood pressure. It was through the roof!!  I was having horrible crippling anxiety everyday for most the day and I already have depression and anxiety disorder.  I was bloated all the time.  I called my doctor and they told me to immediately stop the pills. I'm 37 and average weight. Birth control isn't worth having a stroke.,Dancer2280

If I would have gone off these reviews I wouldn't have ever started taking this birth control let alone any of them.  I have been on it a month now. The first week I had very high anxiety levels which was difficult to push through but after 10 days it subsided.  I do notice I am bloated pretty much all the time but with time I hope that will pass as well. I have had mild cramps every now and then. Otherwise I am fine. Don't let bad reviews scare you off.

The first few weeks were difficult. I had breakthrough bleeding  (bleeding between your periods) and quite terrible anxiety. If I had stopped taking it then I would have rated this med a 2 or 3.

It got so bad that I could no longer do simple day-to-day tasks such as going to class or going to a restaurant. I was having panic attacks daily. It then got to the point where I was terrified to leave my house. I was also overcome with depression. This all happened within the first 2 weeks of taking this pill.

The first 2 days of taking Jolivette I had major headaches, nausea and dizziness so I bought complex B vitamin and took along with almonds and blue berries which helped me a lot.

I am glad I decided to try the pill before the implant. I was a shadow of myself on this pill. It was all I could do to get through the day, because it basically put me in survival mode. I felt sick and tired and I could not motivate myself to stay focused on any of my goals or obligations. It became difficult for me to work, and I have a very demanding job. It was hard to get out of bed. I started falling asleep involuntary every night once it really had a hold on me (week 3-4) I would pass out with my clothes on and without setting an alarm.

At first I felt no different, which was to be expected as a switch can take time to kick in.  Just after I started my second pack I began to feel constantly and uncomfortably bloated.  I read around and found that this severe bloating had affected many other users of Jolivette.  It's unbearable and makes me feel like I'm always pregnant!  I did take a couple tests just to be sure I wasn't and I'm not, just feeling super uncomfortable 24/7.
