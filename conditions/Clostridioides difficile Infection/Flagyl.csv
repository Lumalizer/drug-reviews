0,Flagyl,Clostridioides difficile Infection,8,Taken for less than 1 month,"June 22, 2019",16,I am currently on day 5 of a 14 day course of Flagyl for c diff colitis.   It has helped with the diarrhea and I am already feeling better.  So far I haven’t noticed many side effects.   Maybe a little more anxious at times.  The worst part was the taste and swallowing the pill before it started dissolving.  A coating of peanut butter solved that problem.  Makes it super easy to swallow.   Now let’s just hope it makes the c diff go away.,Madhatter
1,Flagyl,Clostridioides difficile Infection,9,,"March 17, 2017",17,"I have ulcerative colitis, and I tested positive for c diff and was put on Flagyl - 500 mg 4x/day.  The first 5 days I could function although I had no appetite and was dizzy and nauseated.  The last 6 days I was bedridden with nausea and vomiting, aversion to food, dizziness, and the skin on my legs went numb.  It's been a week now and the legs' skin is still numb, although it doesn't affect my mobility.  I don't want to eat anything still but the food doesn't come back up now.  However, all the symptoms of c diff are gone.  Seems to have calmed down the UC as well.  So yes, it worked very well so far but the side effects for me were horrendous.",Lorisar
2,Flagyl,Clostridioides difficile Infection,4,,"October 26, 2016",19,"I am currently finishing up a 14 day round of 3x's a day 500mg Flagyl for C. Diff. C. Diff, alone, is a beast to wrangle. Think food poison but 10x's worse---and the smell, oh that's another thing entirely.  I never leave reviews on medications but with the side effects vs. the benefits that I've experienced, I wanted others to know. Benefits: Finally stopped having uncontrollable diarrhea and gas pain. The side effects didn't kick in until about day 7. So far, I've experienced light sensitivity, numbness and tingling on my left flank, insomnia, and an overall feeling of unrestlessness that is very similar to a panic attack. I've also had a runny nose and headaches. The medicine does work but I cannot wait to be finished!!!!!!!!",Kc16
3,Flagyl,Clostridioides difficile Infection,3,Taken for less than 1 month,"June 1, 2016",19,"Absolutely awful side effects. First the dark urine color (not really a problem, but bizarre), then the fatigue, the nausea, the total loss of appetite. I was on this for 10 days for a c.diff infection (caused by clindamycin... AVOID CLINDAMYCIN) and I lost ten pounds. I had to force food down my throat just so I wouldn't wither away, and I could barely get out of bed. Took care of the worst of the c.diff, but not all of it. I still have a c.diff culture in my gut 6 months later.",smobo
4,Flagyl,Clostridioides difficile Infection,9,Taken for less than 1 month,"April 27, 2015",23,"Took 500mg 3 times per day for 14 days to treat a c. diff infection. Within the 1st week the side effects kicked in. Horrible taste in my mouth 24/7 then followed by constant nausea, loss of appetite. I was so nauseous by the end that I couldn't get off the couch. Took it with meals, and I haven't had an alcoholic drink in 3 yrs. Chewed gum all the time to deal with the taste. Horrible side effects, but very effective. Was feeling normal again within a few days of starting it.",dramaqueen0408
5,Flagyl,Clostridioides difficile Infection,9,,"October 19, 2011",31,"I expected the side effects to be horrible, but happily it's okay, and much better than the symptoms I am taking it for. I am day 4 of a 7 day treatment. I have had legs that hurt, the first two days and initially didn't sleep well and the feeling that all strong antibiotics cause. I am taking plenty rest and my anxiety is much better. It appears these bacteria etc. were making that much worse too. My horrible small bowel problems are almost gone. I would give 10/10 if I know that after I finish the course I can eat normally. Complex carbohydrates are out of my diet, they feed the bacteria, and I need to be able to eat normally again.",TizzysAngel
