0,Metronidazole,Clostridioides difficile Infection,6.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"November 18, 2021",0,Terrible nausea on this medication. I was prescribed 400mg x 3 per day for 10 days for c diff. It’s improved the symptoms of c diff within a few days but it truly is an awful medication to take. It tastes disgusting and the taste lingers in your mouth constantly. I had awful nausea using it and dreaded each time I had to take a tablet. Even though my appetite was gone I was dry heaving because of the metronidazole. I also had some odd visual disturbances. I caught c diff after being given 4 different types of IV antibiotics in hospital for a bacterial infection. I’m using a probiotic to try and avoid getting c diff again after the course of metronidazole ends. C diff is horrendous and if I have to use metronidazole again then I will even if it takes all of my willpower to finish the course. I’ve had an awful lot of heavy duty antibiotics recently but I have to say that metronidazole is amongst the worst for side effects even if it is effective for cdiff.,Hak

I honestly do not know what’s worse, the side effects from this medication or the c diff itself. I am constantly nauseous, especially right After my morning dose. It makes my mouth so dry to the point where I can’t even chew or swallow food, COMPLETE loss of appetite. I am extremely fatigued but feel on edge ? I would not recommend this medication to anyone there has got to be something that causes less suffering.",Kcole

4,Metronidazole,Clostridioides difficile Infection,1.0,,"March 3, 2020",3,"Took 1500mg metronidazole a day. I was able to manage three pills a day for a short time. Now I wish I had never taken it. I had to go to the emergency room several times. Each time, they told me it was because of my C Diff infection but I did not think so. I was throwing up blood and had an intense burning sensation in my stomach. It felt like I had a bunch of hot needles throughout my entire digestive tract, specifically my stomach. They took me off of the medicine early but then put me back on it when my infection returned. Second time around was even worse than the first. More ER visits. Over a year and a half later I am now unable to eat the foods I want and regularly throw up during the night time. Honestly, my life sucks now. Please, if you can afford something else, TAKE IT!! Yes it ""worked"", but there are better alternatives to this drug. I could have taken Vancomycin and I would be okay today. This drug is too dangerous to be on the market & has completely stripped my stomach.",Mel

It wasn’t until 3 months later I found blood in my stool and vomit and immediately went to ER and tested positive for C. diff (the doctors were so confused as to how I could contract it). I'm not sure if my trip was the cause but it seems likely. I was prescribed flagyl and within 2 days my bowel movement was a bit better but the side effects are HORRIBLE, I have constant nausea, brain fog, dizziness, headaches, panic attacks, and the stomach pain is unbearable. I am currently on day 5/10, 3 pills a day 500mg each. I am seeking the ER once more in hopes to find out what is really wrong because there is no way this medication is working!!!!!!

The side effects for me included constant nausea, metal taste in my mouth, brain fog, and insomnia even though I took it with a full meal.

9,Metronidazole,Clostridioides difficile Infection,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"October 7, 2019",2,"I was put on Flagyl after vancomyacin wasn't effective in clearing my cdiff infection. 5 days into taking it my arms went numb and my right leg. I called Dr and was told to stop taking it.2 days after I stopped other symptoms starting showing up. Blurred vision, dizziness, trembling, depersonalization, ear pain, eye pain, severe anxiety, insomnia, stomach pain like being eaten from the inside out, racing heart, blood pressure 180/100. I was like a zombie.Of course the Dr didn't believe I could have all these symptoms after I stopped. So needless to say I had to help myself. I joined the Flagyl toxicity support group on Facebook. Learned Flagyl depletes Thiamine and magnesium. So I began magnesium theronate and AllThiamine. It helped tremendously. I thought I was getting better and then two months down the road joint pain sets in. Thumbs, fingers, knees, back. I'm at a loss on what to do about this.

I only lasted 6 days on it. I woke up with numbness in my arms and legs, muscle weakness, twitching, neck and ear pain, eye pain, insomnia, racing heart, anxiety, and panic attacks. I was told to stop taking it by doctor, but still told there's no way this poison did this to me. I came to learn Flagyl is black boxed by the FDA for being a carcinogenic in mice. I also learned it crosses the blood brain barrier causing lesions, and brain swelling. I've have since joined a Facebook  support group.  It's been two months of hell with symptoms but I'm feeling better except for the racing heart and anxiety. This drug needs to be banned or only used in a life or death situation.",Loo

It has helped with the diarrhea and I am already feeling better.  So far I haven’t noticed many side effects.   Maybe a little more anxious at times.  The worst part was the taste and swallowing the pill before it started dissolving.  A coating of peanut butter solved that problem.  Makes it super easy to swallow.

I was on Cefdinir for 3 days for a UTI and I didn't take a probiotic while on the medication so I contracted C.diff.

It cleared up the infection pretty fast but like I said the side effects were the worst. This is  day 10/10 I still have the metallic taste even though I brush my teeth 4 times a day.

This is the most horrible drug I've ever taken. After two days I started having abdominal cramps and diarrhea. The side effects just got worse and worse up to the point that I had diarrhea at least 15 times a day, all solid and pureed food went through me after an hour and the cramps were so painful that I feared I was dying. I cannot comment on its effectiveness, because I had to discontinue the treatment on day 6 due to the severe side effects - which only began subsiding a week after stopping taking the medication. The very annoying part for me was that how protective my physician talked about both levofloxacin and metronidazole when I mentioned that I was probably suffering from the side effects.",Em

I can't shake the weakness feeling, tired, run down, just spent. I have been unstable on my feet and confused. I can't tell if the c-diff is winning or Metronidazole is winning.

Side effects included nausea, fatigue, light-headed, pain/pressure in the abdomen (though this one might have been from the infection itself) & panic attacks at night. The nausea & fatigue were severe, but not constant. Definitely worse late afternoon & evening. Things I found that helped were drinking pop on ice, eating, and taking the medication with food, which I had to force myself to do --  2 bananas & then the capsule. Drinking lemonade made it worse.

42,Metronidazole,Clostridioides difficile Infection,5.0,,"April 17, 2012",14,"Taking this medication for 10 days for C diff. I am on day seven right now, and it's been horrible. 41-year-old, female, had bloody and mucus and bad diarrhea. I think medicines have fixed the diarrhea and bloody mucus for now, but I am so dizzy. I feel even sicker in other ways. It's causing me major shortness of breath, fatigue, nausea, confusion. Found out the hard way that even putting lotion on my face or body that have any alcohol in them will make you feel even worse on this medication.",Anonymous
43,Metronidazole,Clostridioides difficile Infection,9.0,,"October 19, 2011",31,"Flagyl (metronidazole):I expected the side effects to be horrible, but happily it's okay, and much better than the symptoms I am taking it for. I am day 4 of a 7 day treatment. I have had legs that hurt, the first two days and initially didn't sleep well and the feeling that all strong antibiotics cause. I am taking plenty rest and my anxiety is much better. It appears these bacteria etc. were making that much worse too. My horrible small bowel problems are almost gone. I would give 10/10 if I know that after I finish the course I can eat normally. Complex carbohydrates are out of my diet, they feed the bacteria, and I need to be able to eat normally again.",TizzysAngel
