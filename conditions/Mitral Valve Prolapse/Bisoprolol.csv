0,Bisoprolol,Mitral Valve Prolapse,,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"August 19, 2019",24,"I was put on metoprolol (12.5 mg twice per day) after my heart attack three years ago. However, my cardiologist said that metoprolol was contraindicated for patients with asthma so he changed it to bisoprolol (2.5 mg once per day) because it was more cardio selective than metoprolol. I immediately noticed a big improvement in my exercise tolerance and heart rate while on the treadmill. Hope this helps anyone who is on asthma medications and is having trouble while exercising on metoprolol.",BD
1,Bisoprolol,Mitral Valve Prolapse,4.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"February 21, 2019",15,My history is Bicuspid Aortic valve replaced and grafted Aortic root.  Was on Sotalol for 20 years (it was mostly an antiarrhythmic with some beta blocking qualities)... but then they stopped making it.  Cardiac Doc switched me to Bisoprolol 5mg daily.  1 year later: arrhythmia with a vengeance since going on this.  Have also been taking Magnesium Citrate 150mg daily as per Doc.  Not liking the constant funny heart beats and how tired I am in the afternoon.  Going to see him soon to see if Metoprolol might be a better alternative to this.,Toolman
