0,Inderal,Mitral Valve Prolapse,9,,"October 12, 2014",18,"I have been on this medicine for over 10yrs they had to switch me to this medicine because the other medicine I was on wasn't working anyway more. I was on atenolol for awhile for rapid heart rate and then I had chest pains so they switched me to Inderal because I had mitro-valve, so far it is working.",ellie baby
