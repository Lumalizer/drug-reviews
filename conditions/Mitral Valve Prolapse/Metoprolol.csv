0,Metoprolol,Mitral Valve Prolapse,10,Taken for 5 to 10 years,"November 29, 2021",1,I have been on this medicine 25 mg for seven years now works great. The only problem is my pharmacy changes suppliers all the time. The good thing is I get 90 pills so only have to worry every 3 months. I always ask for the same supplier.,margaret r
1,Metoprolol,Mitral Valve Prolapse,5,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"September 17, 2021",0,"I had a mitral valve replacement After about 6 weeks starting getting shortness of breath doctors said part of healing process, then dizziness confusion, then numbness in feet and hands.  I  kept complaining cardiologists nurse called and said quit taking Metoprolol they had me quit cold turkey.  Then 4 days after quitting I  started having bad withdrawal systems tingling from feet to top of head.  It has been a month now, I  have neuropathy and shortness of breath, pray to God it it will get better. I do have some better days, but doesn't last.  I can breath a little better it can go away quickly, nobody can give me answers, wish I would have researched a lot sooner.  I was on 25mg metoprolol sussinate 80 days , would never take this drug again.  I am sure it helps a lot of people but not me very dissatisfied, maybe it will take a few months to get out of my nervous system and fatty tissue.",Gotdtmse4
2,Metoprolol,Mitral Valve Prolapse,5,,"May 25, 2020",7,"I was prescribed metoprolol for my MVP. I have been on it for about 2 years and It's really helped with the palpitations. I was on 25mg and was perfect for me.  I recently developed high blood pressure and my cardiologist took me off of the metoprolol, and we tried various BP medications, I had side effects (double vision, bloating, diarrhea, headaches, you name it.  She wants me on a beta blocker and beta blockers causes all kinds of side effects. She put me back on metoprolol but now I am on 50mg a day,  Since I have been on the higher dosage, I've gained weight and can't lose it, Again another side effect of this drug.   My wrists and face are swollen. I go again to see her in July and I am almost certain she will up the dosage because the blood pressure is not what it should be .  I am going to suggest that she put me back on my 25 mg and use something else that will work with the metoprolol to help lower my blood pressure.  This is the only drug that can work for my MVP, but at a lower dosage.",Lil K

4,Metoprolol,Mitral Valve Prolapse,9,Taken for 10 years or more,"July 31, 2017",12,20 years of misery and then I come across this gift from God! Give it a shot! FYI- some generics are WAY better than others so if one doesn't work don't give up hope. Plus you can have it prescribed three months at a time to save on costs! Good Luck! Keep that heart rate down! ;),Hollywood39

8,Metoprolol,Mitral Valve Prolapse,10,,"August 15, 2015",11,"I was diagnosed with Paroxysmal Atrial Tachycardia  in 1980 when I was 19 years old. Went to the ER, converted myself via Valsalva Maneuver -- went to my MD the next day/had an echocardiogram done and was diagnosed with Mitral Valve Prolapse. My heart throughout the day kept going into PAT (200+ BPM) No chest pain or anything, but pounding heart/fainting.  I was started on Lopressor at that time .... 100mg BID and this is an amazing drug. Sure I still get the odd PAT episode once in a while, but the pounding and skipped beats are greatly reduced. No side effects at all. It actually has a calming effect. Been on Lopressor for 35 years. Great antiarrhythmic.",Leslie S.
9,Metoprolol,Mitral Valve Prolapse,10,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"January 3, 2015",36,Metoprolol Succinate ER (metoprolol):I take Metoprolol ER 50mg every day to control my tachycardia from POTS (Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome) It also 99% eliminated my occasional issues with Mitral Valve Prolapse.

10,Metoprolol,Mitral Valve Prolapse,4,,"April 3, 2014",28,"I started taking 50mg of Toprol after being admitted to the hospital 6 days ago. I was told I had Mitral Valve Proplase and that I needed to take 50mg daily. It has helped in slowing my rapid heart beat down but the side effects have almost been unbearable. I have hardly slept, after taking the medicine I get short of breath and feel like I'm having an anxiety attack, and I take the medicine at bedtime. In the mornings when I wake for the first two to three hours I feel shaky, sweaty, nauseous, and extremely dizzy. My regular MD took me down to 25mg once daily and I still can't sleep and feel anxious. This is the first day taking 25mg so we'll see how I feel in the morning.",TMMB
11,Metoprolol,Mitral Valve Prolapse,10,Taken for 5 to 10 years,"October 13, 2012",25,"Been on it for 5 yrs. Keeps my blood pressure and mitral valve prolapse under control. Have to take it every 12 hours. Can't go an hour past time or my body knows. I guess you can say that is a not so good thing. But, my symptoms are in check. Refuse to use an alternative medication. The downside to using beta blockers is the side effect. I break out with eczema and psoriasis, these are the biggest problem with this medication, but there are medications that keeps that under control as well.",Anonymous
12,Metoprolol,Mitral Valve Prolapse,8,,"May 3, 2011",42,Toprol-XL (metoprolol):Just put 2 and 2 together after reading side effects and realize that the Toprol XL was causing my rapid weight gain and severely swollen ankles. It has worked great and keeps the Mitral Valve Prolapse symptoms under control but the weight and swelling issues have to be stopped. I guess I have to look for another medicine.,Anonymous
13,Metoprolol,Mitral Valve Prolapse,9,,"August 7, 2009",49,"Toprol-XL (metoprolol):I was diagnosed with mitral valve prolapse syndrome my senior year in college, resulting in a medical discharge from the Army rather than commissioning as an officer. I was blacking out, fainting, and my activity tolerance dropped dramatically as the condition progressed. Metoprolol was prescribed for me to help regulate my heart rate - it worked great for that. I didn't feel the palpitations and heart racing with minimal activity. Downside was that my blood pressure was already low - so being on this medication made my blood pressure drop even lower. Doctors eventually put me on MIDODRINE which constricts my blood vessels causing an increase in blood pressure. The combination works great!",KelliJMcDonald
