0,Atenolol,Mitral Valve Prolapse,10.0,Taken for 10 years or more,"May 21, 2019",19,"At 27 years old I was diagnosed with mitral valve prolapse, hypertension, and fast heart beat.  My fabulous doctor, who was the head of the hypertension department started me on 50mg. Tenormin daily for the first month, and then  increased it to 100mg daily (which is now called Atenolol (generic).   I'm now 62 years old and have successfully been taking the same medication & dosage for all these years!!!",Jen
1,Atenolol,Mitral Valve Prolapse,10.0,Taken for 10 years or more,"May 26, 2017",11,"I've had great luck with this product for the last ten years. I'm on an extremely low dose (12.5mg every 24 hours), and it controls my heart rate and blood pressure beautifully with no side effects. I have found if I take a whole 25mg. tablet a day, sometimes my feet seem a bit cold, but I'd much rather have a controlled heart rate and wear socks than a heart rate in the 120s and warm feet. Overall, though, this product has been fantastic for me!",Anonymous

3,Atenolol,Mitral Valve Prolapse,10.0,,"October 11, 2014",21,I am 39 and identified as having Mitral Valve Prolapse at 28 after worrisome irregular heartbeat manifested itself typically in the evenings. Have used atenolol since then at low dosage (12.5-25mg/day) and am thrilled with the results.  Have experienced no side effects but for a little lethargy upon first starting out (either has passed or I've grown accustomed to it in the evenings).,chrisf1
4,Atenolol,Mitral Valve Prolapse,10.0,Taken for 10 years or more,"July 31, 2012",49,Tenormin (atenolol):Have been using this for many years to regulate my heart beat as I have mitral prolapse and atrial tachycardia and have found it the best out of others.,Anonymous
5,Atenolol,Mitral Valve Prolapse,9.0,,"March 27, 2012",28,I was born with mitral valve prolapse and started having palpitations when going through a lot of stress in my mid-30s.  I was started on Atenolol 25 mg per day.... then noticed about 10 years later that my heart rate was going up again and had bouts of palpitations.  My Dr just adjusted the dosage to 50 mg per day.  I have asthma also but Theophylline ER 200 mg taken twice daily takes care of the asthma.,Seattlechic
6,Atenolol,Mitral Valve Prolapse,9.0,,"May 30, 2011",34,"Tenormin (atenolol):I have been on Tenormin for about 4 years. It certainly has taken care of the heart palpitations. I do not take any caffeine. But other side-effects have occurred: asthma has gotten worse,  I get winded after running only one and a half mile, more often than not, I feel tired, my hair is thinning, I have esophageal spasms, which I have read that Tenormin may induce upper GI problems. I am going off the medication to see if it makes a difference. I exercise regularly, and 7 years ago, my Doctor suggested I take Beta-Blockers, which I wasn't keen on, but since I exercise, he said it wasn't that imperative that I take it. So I'd rather run regularly, and efficiently and be off it.",Anonymous
7,Atenolol,Mitral Valve Prolapse,,,"April 7, 2010",50,"Tenormin (atenolol):I have taken Tenormin/Atenolol for Mitral Valve Prolapse, and accompanying arrhythmias, for probably 20 years.  I VERY rarely have episodes and, so far as I am aware, no side effects of any kind.",Anonymous
