0,Zenpep,Chronic Pancreatitis,1,Taken for less than 1 month,"February 6, 2020",4,"Started using Aenpep. No side effects but honestly it does not work. I been in pain ever since I started taking it. I take it during each meal and I am in pain. Pertyze is what really works for me but my insurance does not want to cover it :( it sucks that we paid too much for insurance and I have to beg for my meds. Actually is the only one I take.  I eat well - I gave up sweets and red meat, coffee, not to many carbs but I hurt. I go on liquid diets for 3 days if not more. As soon as I eat there is my pain again with this pills.",Blanca
