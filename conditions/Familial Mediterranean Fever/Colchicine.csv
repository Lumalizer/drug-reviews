0,Colchicine,Familial Mediterranean Fever,10,,"April 14, 2019",16,"Colcrys (colchicine):I used to take generic colchicine (since 1980).  The Westward brand upset my stomach the least--tho if I missed a dose, I'd have an FMF (familial mediterranean fever) flare. So I'd taken it for years.  Then Mutual/Takeda put colchicine--active ingredient from the Autumn Crocus (which dates back to Pharonic times) through the FDA process and took advantage of the Orphan Exclusivity Drug act because it's used for a rare disease--as well as to treat gout--to have a corner on the market for 7 years.  The price went up immensely--it used to cost me $15 for 180 pills (three month supply) and it went up to $350/mo with Takeda's Colchrys.  The Takeda product really upset my digestive system.I switched to a Turkish product ($3 for 50 pills--take 2 daily) and have also tried the Mexican brand ($3 for 20 days worth).  I feel much better using both of these than the Colcrys or the generic Colcrys (also by Takeda).  Colchicine is very helpful for FMF--but the shenanigans by Mutual and Takeda screwed the FMF patient.",FMF since 1978
