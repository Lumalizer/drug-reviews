0,Vasotec,Left Ventricular Dysfunction,9,,"June 5, 2015",11,"This medication worked great for me as far as keeping my BP in check while I recovered from heart failure.  I did have some mild coughing and dizziness if I got up too fast, but nothing I couldn't handle.  After being on this for 1 1/2 years I developed angioedema - swelling of lip and face.  Was immediately taken off the meds, told to take some Benadryl.  The symptoms went away and I was put on a different medication.",JustMEinNC
