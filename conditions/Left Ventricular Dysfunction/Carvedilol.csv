0,Carvedilol,Left Ventricular Dysfunction,3.0,Taken for 10 years or more,"August 21, 2020",14,"Was put on carvedilol 6.25 twice a day after having a heart attack 11 years ago. Within several months I started to have bruising in my toes with moderate pain. My toes also became ulcerated at times. Cardiologist, vascular doctor and internist never could figure out what was causing it. My cardiologist recently up my dose to 12.5 twice a day. Within a week  my hands started to turn white when I washed them in cool water, and when they warmed up they turned blood red and where very painful ,BP was also going up. Looks like I have carvedilol drug induced raynaud's syndrome. Looked up what it looks like in the toes, BINGO! All these years! Turns out, its a side affect in up to 10% of people. So frustrating! Doctor  lowered the dose and now I have to go in for a consult $$$.",Rock
1,Carvedilol,Left Ventricular Dysfunction,,Taken for less than 1 month,"December 30, 2019",19,"Started this drug when I went into the hospital for takotsubo cardiomyopathy. After the 3rd day of using Carvedilol I felt weak and felt nauseous. We called 911 and I went to the hospital. The doctors think the medicine may have contributed to my low drop in blood pressure. They advised me to check my blood pressure before I take the medicine, making sure my blood pressure is high enough.",Anonymous
2,Carvedilol,Left Ventricular Dysfunction,10.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"September 22, 2019",16,"I take carvedilol for my dilated cardiomyopathy along with Lisinopril and Lasix, have been on it for awhile now haven't had all these problems if I eat before taking. But I will add I was started on a low dose and my Doctor worked me up very slowly to a higher one it seems to have worked cause my BP is very good as is my EF which is why I'm taking it.  Maybe ask your Doctor to do the same thing mine did for me, slower is always better.",VEAck
3,Carvedilol,Left Ventricular Dysfunction,7.0,Taken for 5 to 10 years,"July 15, 2019",29,"I was diagnosed 8yrs ago  with severe dysfunction left vent with EF 26 was put on Carvedilol 8yrs ago my EF has been steady now at around 46-48 which I am grateful for but the side effects I have experienced from 25mg x2  Carvedilol has been horrible, hypotensive I walk around feeling impaired almost drunken.  I have asked my Dr if I can reduce it or come off it but he is reluctant to do this because I have had good heart function. I am going on 65 now I really don't enjoy doing much of anything because I am always tired and lightheaded and I am seriously considering cutting it back on my own. This is no way to live quality of live from this med is pretty poor.",Robdigi
4,Carvedilol,Left Ventricular Dysfunction,10.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"December 1, 2015",47,"This is a tough med to start. But after a few weeks I got adjusted and titrated up to the right dose.  My EF was close to 35% when I started it. When I began taking this drug I would get dizzy which would instill panic episodes in me.  But I stuck with it and my EF is 55% now. I now don't even notice the Coreg unless I forget it. And when I do forget it, I get a little jittery. It's a miracle drug. Tough to start but worth the result.",Young guy

(I also fell and broke the femur articulation with my hip in late March). My doctor gave me this medicine, Coreg, and it took away the swelling in my feet, ankles, legs and knees.

This medicine has really improved my life.",Odelle
