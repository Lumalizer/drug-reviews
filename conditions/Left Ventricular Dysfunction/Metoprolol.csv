0,Metoprolol,Left Ventricular Dysfunction,10,Taken for 10 years or more,"July 5, 2021",1,After a diagnosis of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy the drug has relaxed my heart muscle allowing it to pump blood better and also eliminated or lowered the extra heart beats that I experienced. It may also assist in treating or managing my recent diagnosis of A-Fib. Only negative side effect involved my feet being a little cold at times but that was remedied by putting on a pair of sox.,pbaehnman
1,Metoprolol,Left Ventricular Dysfunction,4,Taken for less than 1 month,"November 3, 2019",9,Lopressor (metoprolol):Was put on Lopressor by my cardiologist after a session in the ER with excessive PVCs.The side effect (constant diarrhea) makes this drug unviable for me.,BL
2,Metoprolol,Left Ventricular Dysfunction,2,Taken for less than 1 month,"November 5, 2018",12,"Only took METOPROLOL by Zydus (Indian manufacturer) for 4 days and was so nauseated all day.  I could barely eat, and started dry heaving . It was prescribed because I've been having shortness of breath and heart palpitations lately. Spent 2 days in a local hospital and tests determined I have a cardiac arrythmia issue in my left upper heart chamber. This med did absolutely nothing to curtail my symptoms, and the nausea all day had me miserable. I am stopping the med. I am also concerned about quality control of pharmaceuticals. Just not worth the risks and side effects.",Samaya

4,Metoprolol,Left Ventricular Dysfunction,5,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"November 19, 2016",52,"Metoprolol Succinate ER (metoprolol):Just wanted to share my experience getting OFF metoprololER 25 mg, and switching to Diltiazem ER, 120 mg. After a pulmonary embolism (no symptoms except PVCs), I suffered PVC w/anxiety and panic attacks, even while treating blood clots with Coumadin. I was put on 25 mg metoprolol ER to help the anxiety and PVCs- it helped  immediately. I stayed on several years. I continued the dosage, and tried to stay/get in shape. I steadily gained weight, assumed it was age. Exercising felt impossible. After a year or so, I was also having afternoon hypotension upon standing quickly. I developed symptoms of asthma and chest tightness + fatigue. I was switched to Diltiazem. After 8 days of body adjustment (w/small amt Ativan 2 days), I again feel human.",szuletik
