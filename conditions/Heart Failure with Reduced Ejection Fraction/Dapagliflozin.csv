0,Dapagliflozin,Heart Failure with Reduced Ejection Fraction,1,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"October 17, 2021",7,Farxiga (dapagliflozin):My doctor thought I would benefit from this. He is very skilled but he was wrong about Farxiga. The only bad reviews I have for it is feeling lightheaded and dizzy. I was taking 10 mg then I started taking just a half of a tablet and still feel woozy. It just feels really weird like you are floating in the air. Not a good med for me. Entresto and bisoprolol are the best 2 meds for heart failure along with anticoagulant brilinta and aspirin,Jay
