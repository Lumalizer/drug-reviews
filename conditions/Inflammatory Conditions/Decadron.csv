4,Decadron,Inflammatory Conditions,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"March 25, 2016",48,"Never take this drug. I am a healthy individual that had a bad experience with this drug.  I Received one shot because I had the flu. 1 week later I had burning pains running all through my body. They gave me a shot in my butt and its still sore 2 sweeks later. I had trouble sleeping, couldn't breath at night and thought I was going crazy. My resting heart rate went from 49-58 beats a minute. I don't know what this drug does to the body but its not good. You have mood swings from anger, confusion, weakness, coordination etc..... Please ask the doctor what they are giving you before they inject you. It could do more harm than good later.",Jason Jones

8,Decadron,Inflammatory Conditions,8.0,,"March 6, 2015",42,I have disc issues.  When the inflammation around these discs starts to put pressure on the nerves going to my feet and legs. A shot of this stuff is like gold. It looses it effect the longer you use it so save this as a last resort.,Wesandmichelle
9,Decadron,Inflammatory Conditions,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"June 19, 2012",29,Headache due to AVM in brain: I was given this in the hospital via IV in hopes of bringing down a severe headache caused by my AVM. Within the first minute the drip began I started freaking out as well as developing a severe rash so they unhooked it immediately. Even after it having been stopped I was inconsolable and hyperventilating for about a half an hour. The morning after I was vomiting and had diarrhea. 48 hours later my stomach is still churning and the rash is just beginning to fade. Safe to say Decadron is on my allergy list now.,agangx3
