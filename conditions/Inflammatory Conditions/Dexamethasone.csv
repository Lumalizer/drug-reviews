1,Dexamethasone,Inflammatory Conditions,6.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"February 26, 2022",0,"I believe this drug is very helpful for individuals who have adrenal issues, like Addison’s Disease, etcFor me the results have been quite mixed. I have had ongoing piriformis syndrome for the past 9 months. I’ve had four trigger point injections with dexmethasone (10mg). After the first injection I felt good - my pain went down to almost zero and I had good energy. I did have some insomnia and increased urination, increased appetite- which resolved.Fast forward to this past month- I had a trigger point injection on 2/25/2022 at 9:15 am and by 2:00 pm was feeling very fatigued. I thought it was because I had a busy day. That evening I was both a bit anxious and tired - and I had trouble getting to sleep. However the next morning (today) I felt like I took a large dose of Valium. So fatigued this morning I could not get out of bed - forced myself to. I feel a combination of anxiety and fatigue and a flat mood. It’s effective for nerve pain, but side effects for sure!",Jinx342
2,Dexamethasone,Inflammatory Conditions,9.0,,"November 10, 2021",6,I don't like reading these reviews because they are going to scare you out of taking what a licensed doctor has prescribed you. This medication saves lives sometimes. I have been struggling with panic disorder GAD & depression caused by anxiety for almost a year now & thank GOD I didn’t read the reviews until after because I probably wouldn’t have taken this for my extremely swollen tonsils - I almost couldn’t swallow & in 14hrs almost no swelling. The only side effect I got was I was a little irritable about 3 hours after taking two 4mg pills but I ate and it went away so I could have just been hangry & one black stool. These review pages are always gonna have extreme experiences because unfortunately that can happen but it’s RARE. Also no offence there are a lot of dramatic people out there (me being one & I was even fine) or people with other complications that point fingers. My mental health recovery got delayed almost a year because I freaked myself out from drugs.com reviews,Jaime

6,Dexamethasone,Inflammatory Conditions,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"June 19, 2021",15,"I was prescribed this because of multiple injuries in a car crash (Multiple disc herniations and other injuries), and the doc thought it'd help relieve the inflammation. The doc wanted me to take it for roughly a week, but I couldn't tolerate the side effects after 2.5 days, which I started feeling within hours of the first dose. I experienced sweating profusely around the clock, really bad suicidal thoughts, severe rage issues (I'm normally calm), severe dry mouth, increased inflammation, shortness of breath, heaviness in my chest, exhaustion, dizziness, weight gain, increased appetite, increased pains in the injured areas, no sleep for three days straight, extremely high anxiety with panic attacks, blurred and double vision, and an absolutely horrific headache that wouldn't go away even with ibuprofen. I also experienced crying fits and I'm not a crier. This medicine didn't help me at all. The brutal side effects I endured aren't worth taking it for me.

I have the worst indigestion and heartburn I have ever experienced. The heartburn is constant from the moment I wake up, whether I have eaten or not, and is made worse by ANY amount of food. I stopped taking the medication a week ago and I still cannot enjoy food. It feels like there is a rock stuck in my throat. I am bloated beyond belief and the pressure in my stomach is painful. I don't ever feel hungry and I am retaining water, I don't know how I don't burst. I broke out horribly. There was also SEVERE depression and I already have anxiety but that was amplified too. At least that part only lasted for about a week. As far as the heartburn, I am scared I will never go back to feeling normal. I just want to be able to eat.",JB

I was bawling like a baby. I do have Fibromyalgia but I have had many shots in the muscle that sting. This was no sting! The doctor chalked it up to everything that was going on with me. I am not a dramatic person, but this was the weirdest, most painful intravenous muscle shot I have ever had!

I went from bed-ridden from the pain to back to almost normal activity.  It spikes my blood sugar pretty good for several days and I have to monitor my sugar more closely, but that is worth dealing with to be pain-free.",Anonymous
52,Dexamethasone,Inflammatory Conditions,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"June 19, 2012",29,Decadron (dexamethasone):Headache due to AVM in brain: I was given this in the hospital via IV in hopes of bringing down a severe headache caused by my AVM. Within the first minute the drip began I started freaking out as well as developing a severe rash so they unhooked it immediately. Even after it having been stopped I was inconsolable and hyperventilating for about a half an hour. The morning after I was vomiting and had diarrhea. 48 hours later my stomach is still churning and the rash is just beginning to fade. Safe to say Decadron is on my allergy list now.,agangx3

55,Dexamethasone,Inflammatory Conditions,2.0,,"January 21, 2011",28,"I can say it did some pretty good things for my back (bulging disc). It wasn't a cure at all by any means, but helped a lot. Downside. Same as others, depression, huge appetite increase but at same time everything tasted horrible, bad mood swings, suicidal thoughts (not normal for me), horrible insomnia, blurred vision, cold sweats, hands feet tingling, numb. Swollen mouth, gums, lips, almost unbearable chest pain. At one point wife was ready to call 911. Oh, can't forget the late night extreme skeletal pain. Every bone in my body felt like it was about to snap. If you're like I was and are in so much pain you can hardly walk, try it. Be careful.",bbeckl
