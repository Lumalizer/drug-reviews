0,Methylprednisolone,Inflammatory Conditions,5.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"February 26, 2022",0,All was good when I was taking them besides a headache I was like everyone else felt young again. I have rheumatoid arthritis. I loved the medicine........ Until it was done. I've had an opioid problem and had severe withdraws from it. This is right next to it. I only did a one week pack 6 then 5 then 4 so on. I wish I was warned of the after effects I would have NEVER taken them. If I never had to stop they would be wonderful but the withdraws from just one weeks use had been awful it's been 3 days and I still have a headache muscle aches fuzzy head no energy sick to my stomach. I threw up the day after I stopped and have had an upset stomach since. Depression. I'm finally starting to feel a little normal. I will never take them again unless it's life or death.,Drc
1,Methylprednisolone,Inflammatory Conditions,10.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"February 25, 2022",0,"I’ve taken the Medrol dose pack which is taking over several days a few times when my back has gone out. I’m talking about bedridden for like a month back being out. Within a few days of throwing it out I can tell such a big difference. And then they effects last for a good month for me at least. Sometimes even longer. There are a few side effects like sometimes I’ll have an elevated heart rate and get cranky or can’t fall asleep but it’s worth it for me to get over the back pain quicker and better. With Covid make sure you talk to your doctor though to see if it’s safe for you because I do believe and don’t quote me, that it can compromise your immune system so just be careful while you are on it and after you stop taking it for a little while. Also you can only do the medrol dose pack a few times a year so pick and choose wisely when you want to take it if it is for back pain.",Amm

I developed an acute inflammatory response 8 days after injection. I’ve taken a Medrol Dosepak in the past years ago and last year prednisone for an allergic reaction to a BP medication.  I took all 6 pills the first day, the swelling has gone down, but I’m experiencing flushing and hoarseness. I’m on day 2. It’s a six day dose.  I’m going to try to continue the meds as I know they work.  The flushing is uncomfortable and hopefully will subside. I do take BP meds and I haven’t checked my blood pressure yet.

This drug has been a miracle drug for me with minimal side effects. This drug enables me to walk within one day of treatment.

Within hours of taking first dose the pain from surgery was minimized.   I dosed according to package.  Not only did it reduce the swelling, inflammation, pain for almost 6 days, it helped with my arthritic hands, sore but healing fractured shoulder, fractured toe pain, sore knees, and other inflammatory issues & the vertigo.    I was able to only use ibuprophen for 6 days, but last night when I fell asleep the mouth pain hit me like a truck, I was up half the night and had to sit up,  take Tramadol for some relief, my aches and pains are slowly returning today.

6,Methylprednisolone,Inflammatory Conditions,3.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"December 28, 2021",1,"I would have to say that this medication is a good / bad drug. Every time I have taken it for my lupus it seems like it works for 2 to 3 days and then for the next 3 days it just goes back to having bad inflammation. I don't like the side effects I get from it which are I eat like crazy, and I have major insomnia and probably sleep maybe 3 hours each night while I'm on it for the 6 days. I don't understand why it only works for the first 3 days for me? I don't know if because it's the dose pack and the amount is all given at first? I don't know if there was a way to give me the amount on the first day without any major side effects gladly take it.",Gypsychylde13
7,Methylprednisolone,Inflammatory Conditions,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"October 31, 2021",3,"I took this for about 6 days, realized it wasn’t doing anything but making me feel weird and slightly dizzy. 2 days later I have a full blown anxiety attack (thought it was a heart attack). Also extreme headaches that have gotten slightly better after a week but I still get sharp pains in my head. Also, blurred vision & dizziness. I was prescribed some anxiety medicine and it has helped for the anxiety part of things but the other effects are very extreme. Hopefully they go away but I say the chance of the after effects are not worth the risk of taking this! I’m happy I found this thread and saw it wasn’t just me going through these things",kait

11,Methylprednisolone,Inflammatory Conditions,9.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"August 14, 2021",5,"I suffer from severe health anxiety and a medication phobia. When I'm prescribed a drug, I come onto these sites and scour the reviews, usually terrified from all the negative ones I see. I'm not sure why people leave these extremely negative reviews. I guess they just want to share their experience. But what happens is those experiences frighten people like me who don't really have a choice in taking a prescribed drug. Let me now tell you my experience.I read that this drug can change your mood, make you anxious, etc. I suffer from many mental health issues, including panic disorder, so of course I was very worried to take this drug. I can tell you right now that I had NO side effects while taking this drug. There was only one night where I felt a little anxious -- maybe comparable to how I would feel having 2 cups of coffee. To remedy this, I drank some calming tea and used my weighted blanket at night. Other than that, it was completely fine.",Marley J

The first handful of times taken on various occasions  I suffered insomnia the first 2 nights of the 6 day course which otc sleep aid helped and also had hot flashes for two days but the benefits certainly outweigh the minimal effects. Usually I feel calmer during the day and more amped up at night, no matter what time I take the medicine. Thankfully this time I've only had a few hot flashes however I've been euphoric and sad throughout the day, like my mood is really up or really down and it stinks but this is the price to pay when you have some health conditions. I am usually more tired the last day of taking the course and after ending the course I have stomach bloating for a few days.

Although it did seem to resolve some of my pain, it caused other problems including increasing the back pain, so much so that I cut back taking it quicker than 1 pill/day. I'm going through menopause, and not only did it bring on a period within 48 hours of starting the regimen, it was a very painful and heavy one with magnified night sweats.  I contacted my doctor's office and asked them to put that on the ""do not prescribe"" list for me for the future",RomanMom

20,Methylprednisolone,Inflammatory Conditions,5.0,,"November 22, 2020",11,Medrol Dosepak (methylprednisolone):My dentist put me on this after I had a root canal that was continuing to give me problems. The tooth stayed very tender and it pushed off her placing the crown. I was hesitant at first because of the side effects it caused to some people. Especially the vision side effects. But I finally took it. It worked wonders - 'at first'. All of the pain and tenderness in the tooth went away after the first dose. I took all the pills for the first day dose at once which the instructions said I could do.  I'm a 42 yr old woman and  I had no side effect other than a sharp increase in my sexual drive and a little blurred vision. I noticed that as the dosage started to be decreased the tenderness immediately came right back. Now I'm finished with the pack (I only took it for one week) and the tenderness is back. Although a little less than before that tooth is definitely tender again. I will have to retreat the root canal and that will be expensive and and painful.,Tiffany

After two hours my eye/head pressure subsided around 80% and my nausea was gone, I felt comfortable to try taking my second dose of two pills at 5pm. Within 30min all of my bad reaction symptoms came back tenfold, my left eye swelled badly and bulged. I had to go to emergency care. I was instructed to stop taking the pills and see an eye doctor if needed. It's been 16 hours since my last dose and I feel like I've been hit by a truck.

Yesterday, the pain was so bad that I went to the ER.  They gave me a dose of this medication at the hospital along with a toradol injection.  The pain was still pretty bad last night but manageable enough to fall asleep.  I woke up early in the morning and the pain in my fingers was about a 4-5.  Took 800 mg of ibuprofen (ibuprofen didn't work on the pain before) along with my first at-home dose of methylprednisolone and went back to bed without my wrist braces on.  I woke up about an hour ago and the pain is significantly lower than before!  Although I'm still feeling tingling in my fingers, I'm now able to pour drinks and wash dishes and I don't feel the need to wear braces anymore.  This is definitely a miracle drug.

When I do it I am out of commission. Only 1 or 2 positions are tolerable and those require laying down. After 2 days of the dose pack I can walk again. After 3 or 4 days I am pretty much back to normal. My only issue with this is I have to get a script from the doctor. This usually leaves me at least one day on my couch in immobilizing pain.

An urgent weekend visit resulted in a steroid injection and a pack of these pills. I started taking them along with 800mg ibuprofen, using ice packs, and continuing my PT stretches. It took a couple days but I'm starting to feel better and I hope it continues! I do feel more thirsty, have a lot of energy and need to pee more often (probably from drinking much more water). But so far those are the only side effects I notice. And honestly, the energy boost is appreciated after the exhausting, extremely painful last couple of months.",Sciatica

Over the course of three days I was very moody, stomach and chest pain, constipation, and never slept but once discharged after 3 days of treatment I was back to my old self within 48hours.

After the first dose of taking all 6 at once (6 day cycle of 21 pills) I slept great, but woke up with terrible dry mouth and throat, and had trouble breathing. Also feeling fatigue was an issue. Being an 18 yo male I would rather just cope with the pain, and simply wear the brace that they gave me to take the pressure off my foot, I feel that the adverse affects I got were not worth taking the inflammation off through time; although it did take care of the inflammation within two days.",Nickk57
