1,Meloxicam,Inflammatory Conditions,9.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"March 8, 2022",0,One of the few exceptional miracle drugs. It relieved my inflammation pain completely even better than the narcotic based family of drugs. I could easily halve my pain meds just using Meloxicam. I only stopped to prevent kidney damage.

In the beginning it helped my pain, but soon side effects like constipation, bloating, and gas crept in. I kept taking to see if they would subside but never did. My gut is still recovering. Too bad.

My hips gave out and I fell in my driveway for the 3rd time in four years.  I've been taking it for 2 days now and nothing.  Absolutely no help. The toradol shot they gave me at the ER didn't do anything either.  I've literally been screaming and crying in pain for over 2 days now.

The following day, I decided to try half at breakfast and half at lunch to lessen the side effect.  I did the research first to make sure that was ok.   Later in the evening on the second day, I was getting ready for bed and the worst stomach pain I have ever experienced hit me like a train.  It lasted about 20 minutes and I kept pacing the floor wondering what a nightmare it would be to go to the ER in a pandemic.   It was HORRIBLE.  I will never take that med again.",Liz

13,Meloxicam,Inflammatory Conditions,8.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"April 12, 2021",5,I have been taking meloxicam off and on a couple of weeks at a time for 6 months but 5 weeks I have been taking it solid. It has caused me to gain 8 lb. I had a hip pinning 6 months ago and my knee has been inflamed ever since which is why I'm taking the meloxicam and it has helped tremendously. I'm  now having edema in the leg and foot on my left side plus my blood pressure has gone up to 180/108 today so I have stopped taking it.

14,Meloxicam,Inflammatory Conditions,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"March 23, 2021",6,I was suffering from tendonitis in my left leg along with severe sciatica pain for over a month.  I couldn't bend my knee past 90 degrees without severe pain shooting through the entire leg.  It ached and throbbed 24/7 even while resting.  I was given 15 mg of Meloxicam and I was amazed.  I was able to walk without a limp on the first day.  I'm only on my second day of the medicine and can feel it is going to be even better before the end of the day.  I tried NSAIDS of every kind and even Opioids prior to this prescription that had ZERO results.  Meloxicam is basically a miracle drug for me!  I highly recommend giving it a try.,WASUSAF

16,Meloxicam,Inflammatory Conditions,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"January 26, 2021",10,I was diagnosed with degenerative disc disease; after complaining of chronic pain in 2019. I am allergic to opiates; so I was using Diclofenac a lot. It did very little to reduce the pain. I then realized the pain was caused by muscle spasms around the bad disc; so I switched to methocarbamol. The only effective dose for that was 1500 mg. up to three times per day. But I still had inflammation; so I was put on meloxicam 15 mg. once a day. I have used 13 pills so far and have not had to use the methocarbamol but 1 time since starting meloxicam. I felt better after the first dose of meloxicam.,DegenDisc

Was finding it hard to get up and down steps and as the day wore on after being on my feet, the pain was tough to tolerate.  The dr. prescribed 15mg meloxicam 1x a day.  The pain was noticeably different after one day.  It has been 6 days now and there is no doubt the inflammation is down and the pain is nearly insignificant.

I have lower back issues with disc degeneration and herniated I think. Anyway I randomly get episodes where it’s so painful to do anything from sitting, getting up, to barely standing much less upright unless I’m holding on and leaning most of my weight on to furniture, trying to sit or stand, bending, have to be creative about wiping myself and pulling my underwear and pants up using my toes and wash my hands, pain laying down or take a couple steps to walk. These tasks wipes me out and makes me not want do them again because I just might not make it back to bed and call an ambulance.  I was instructed to take this on the days I get an episode. On a scale of 1 - 10 my mobility/ functionality during an episode is a 2/10. I rate this medication a 3/10 on its most effective hour: 6hrs after taking it. It helped a little I made it to the bathroom twice in one evening but still using furniture to lean and hold on.",Maria

I was unable to sit comfortably and in significant pain.... until this was prescribed. Within ONE day I had almost complete relief. I did not experience any side effects. I took every morning with food. Due to long term effects I now only take when really in need. Within one day of stopping my pain did return but more manageable.

I have been completely spaced out since starting it; feeling like I’m high. I’ve also experience stomach pains, bad headaches, dizziness, and just all around not normal.

31,Meloxicam,Inflammatory Conditions,4.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"December 21, 2019",23,"I am 28 years old and Ive been suffering from post chikungunya arthropathy for the past 2 months and been on complete bed rest with pain in my lower back, SI joints, both ankles and knees, and migrating pain in my shoulders and hands depending on how I use them (usually things like lifting my phone will cause me pain). I've tried HCQ and Indomethacin with no significant improvement so I was started on Meloxicam 15mg. I took it only once and developed extreme dizziness, nausea and a crushing headache within 1 hour. I didn't have any joint pain but my head felt like it was about to explode and I had difficulty breathing. This effect lasted for 1 full day and I will never touch Meloxicam again. I will say it was effective at tackling joint pain in a way that no other medicine I'd tried had, but this dizziness was so disorienting and scary that I'd rather take the joint pain any day. If you're starting Meloxicam, please be aware of the severe side effects- to be used only as a last resort!",C

I have recommended it to my friends. I am so glad my Dr. listened to me and helped me with my suffering. I highly recommend this medicine. I don’t have arthritis, and hopefully I never will, but this medicine really works for my pain. I don’t take it regularly. I try to save it for when I need it and take it until the pain goes away.

But man, there are a lot of side effects listed, many digestive related. I had prior to using meloxicam, so its hard  to say if it is causing any or making anything worse. My best evaluation of it is that it helps with inflammatory and nerve pain. Usually I take an Aleve with it. I will keep on using on an as needed basis.",Willie

42,Meloxicam,Inflammatory Conditions,9.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"September 30, 2019",48,"I first took the 15 mg. of meloxicam.  It is far too strong, got very sick, fever and stomach pain.  Tried it again a month later but at the 7.5 mg. dose, bingo!  I always take it in the morning as it gives me insomnia if taken at night and never take it with an empty stomach.  The fuller your gut, the better it works for me, usually within 2-4 hours.  I take it shortly after eating a hearty breakfast.  I am lucky that I do not need to take it daily, 1-2 times a week, if that.  Also, I avoid alcohol 24 hrs. before or after taking it.  My osteo stiffness in my right knee is now free of that.  My T-12 compression issues are relieved.  I can now sit for hours and have resumed jogging again.  This stuff works well for me.  Do use it with caution though.",Timbo
