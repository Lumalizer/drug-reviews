0,Kenalog-40,Inflammatory Conditions,1,,"February 16, 2022",2,"I would NEVER recommend this Kenalog steroid to anyone under any circumstances. I was given it for Fluid in shoulder.Within 1 minute I felt like I could fall down,  the left side of my face was Red Hot!! And the Hot flashes persistently happens to this day 7 months later! For 5 months they were horrible. My blood pressure went from 120/80 which is perfect to 164/104 and I almost had a stroke. My pain in my shoulder at no point was better an my Doctor at the Medical center never went over the side effects with me . I even asked and all he said was I have never heard of anything bad happening with the steroid. Which was a BOLD face lie. After hundreds of horror stories I’ve read there is NO way doctors should ever use this steroid! Very very dangerous people. My left eye gets blurry also and it is weird how it feels. Almost a foggy feeling. This drug is banned in the UK for a reason. They should stop doctors from using this anymore. I have prayed for this many times. STAY clear of Kenalog!!!!! It’s a life threatening drug",David Pack
1,Kenalog-40,Inflammatory Conditions,10,,"December 27, 2019",4,"Years ago I fell and broke my hand and have a tear in my rotator cuff. My hand healed fine, but for years I have pain in my shoulder. My physical therapist helped me gain my motion back. The shoulder is still painful so at least twice a year I need to get Kenalog-40 injections for pain. Thank God the only side effect I have is, around 4 days after my face gets red and hot for 2 days. I have a sensitive stomach and unable to take Aleve, Aspirin etc. so between physical therapy and this injection my life is back.",BKGG
2,Kenalog-40,Inflammatory Conditions,1,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"November 23, 2019",8,"To all the people who have had 1 injection and love being pain free, BEWARE.  I have permanent damage from the injections and will take the pain over the awful side effects.  It’s a roller coaster.  The more injections the more permanent damage.  I have permanent indentions in both buttocks that affect my sitting, injection site burns, itches, hurts & it’s been 6 months since last one, sweat constantly, sleep is rare, NEVER AGAIN.  They hook you on the feel good for a while and damage you more over time.",Lifeisruined
3,Kenalog-40,Inflammatory Conditions,1,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"September 27, 2019",25,"I had a shot of Kenalog put in each SI joint. He said he put a total of 30 on 8/6/19.  They never told me about any side effects and I've been miserable ever since.  Severe fatigue, shortness of breath, very bad anxiety, weak, depressed and it hasn't got any better.  It also messed up my thyroid medicaiton. I have no thyroid and now its very low which is making things worse.  I wish someone could tell me how long these side effects last.  It will be 2 months on the 6th of October and I'm not better.  These shots have ruined my life and now they told to never get another one which I would never. I just want my life back.  Could someone tell me how long it will take these side effects to go away.   Thank you.",gingerlucy
