I took  8 tablets and my side effects were that I had blurred vision, my heart started racing at really fast pace  so I ended up in A&E thought I was having a heart attack .These tablets are very strong.  The doctor told me to take them 4 at a time now.  I did but I nearly passed out for 4 hours after taking them. I have to go back to my doctor as I don't think I can take them but I do want to get well again.",Anonymous

3,Prednisolone,Inflammatory Conditions,10.0,,"May 4, 2020",5,"I was put on prednisolone for an inner ear problem caused by a hormonal imbalance. I'm very sensitive to medication and I knew this when taking the full dose prescribed. I took 20 mg's 3 times the first day and found that I could not sleep that night and had anxiety and a headache. I dropped down to 40 mg's at 8 am and 12 pm the next day and slept very good. No anxiety and no headache. I do take the pills with food. It has greatly decreased the inflammation I felt in the back of my head near my ear. I'm feeling better. Although, I'm on an antibiotic too. I was scared to take this after reading many poor reviews but, I'm so glad I did. I suffered for a long time before knowing it was my ear causing the problem and I'm so glad I was prescribed this medication. I'm only taking them for 5 days though.",Jeni
4,Prednisolone,Inflammatory Conditions,2.0,,"February 18, 2020",1,"Have been on this drug  prednisolone for 4 days to help bring down swelling around my right knee as my body has Psoriatic  Arthritis I also have diabetes type 2. The dose was 25mg twice a day. Everything seemed fine, till early in the evening of Tuesday 17/2/20 thats when my blood glucose  hit the roof. I was up way too high. Its a wonder I didn't go into a coma. I didn't realise the side effects were that bad, since reading some of the other comments of side effects of others who have taken this drug, I did notice I had similar. The drug may have its good points for some, for me over all, it's not worth it,  I'll discontinue taking them. I am more concern about the blood glucose getting out of hand, and increase of infections, as diabetes type 2 is known to develop gangrene, when infections get worse or not treated.",Some body

6,Prednisolone,Inflammatory Conditions,10.0,,"September 18, 2019",11,"I have ankylosing spondylitis that started in my middle 20s, and have suffered chronic back pain most of my life, this disease was never pick up by doctors until I asked for blood test for this disease, which I had done in my early 50s. My spine  is totally wrecked with disk's worn out, most disk's are bulged and have even slipped,  been on so many pain killers but they do nothing but just take the edge of pain in mornings. I have been on this course of Prednisolone just over a year ago for about 2 weeks and it was very good for pain. Well I have just started another course as my pain is very bad, this medication is fantastic for the pain I'm in and I will keep taking them for longer than I have before. I take 5 pills ( 25 mg total ) in mornings and with no food, the only down fall I have with Prednisolones is they make me very sad, I can cry at anything? But that's all, much better to be sad than be in the pain I was going through, I'm now in my 70s",sally44
7,Prednisolone,Inflammatory Conditions,7.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"May 2, 2019",3,"I was prescribed this medication for a tooth that needed a root canal. My dentist was unable to finish my initial visit because even after 12 shots of Novocaine, I could still feel it when he hit that nerve. So he prescribed this. I took the first 6 tablets in 2 doses since I received it late in the day. Day 2 was great! I had no tooth pain, and I felt 15 years younger! No knee pain, neck pain, or back pain either. I did notice a couple of incidents of heart palpitations that evening, but I sometimes get those anyway, so I wasn't too concerned. I did notice that I was extremely thirsty while on this medication. By day three I noticed my tooth throbbing an hour or so before I was due for the next dose, but I toughed it out. Day four was the same but since the doses were further apart, it was hard to ignore the pain. By day 5 I was supplementing with Advil every 6 hours. Day 6 I had a little vertigo, but not too terrible.",Dee Dee

10,Prednisolone,Inflammatory Conditions,2.0,,"March 26, 2017",11,"I have had a very stubborn sinus infection that just won't clear (6 months +). The doctor prescribed 7 days - 30mg of Prednisolone. The first three days I felt great. A lot of energy, clearer breathing, better sleep however after then it went downhill fast. My anxiety and panic sky rocketed after a year of being fine. I was shaking, weak legged, dizzy constantly, my heart rate was through the roof (felt like I had drunk 10 coffee's). I had worst sinus pressure and headaches as well. About day 5 it made my sinus problems worse as well, congestion, mucus production was in overdrive!Three days off them now and still haven't not calmed down. Back to the GP we go :(",TDEvans21

15,Prednisolone,Inflammatory Conditions,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"July 5, 2015",9,"ENT prescribed me 1 x 25mg daily for 10 days to treat tinnitus, in case it was caused by a blocked Eustachian tube.  I had a very bad reaction to steroid.  I suffered from severe insomnia, depression and anxiety.  Psychologically, it caused me a lot of pain.  I started tapering off the Prednisolone after 7 days.  My ENT advised to just stop and not taper which concerned me as I was told to definitely taper so I tapered on my own by going down from 25mg -> 12.5mg -> 6.25mg.  I still suffered from the same psychological issues for 10 days afterwards.  Eventually my GP prescribed me Valium.  After taking 1 x 10mg valium, I found I returned to a normal psychological state (no anxiety, no depression and sleeping fine).  Tinnitus was not helped.",DM08

19,Prednisolone,Inflammatory Conditions,5.0,,"July 23, 2009",25,"Prescribed to help with rheumatoid arthritis symptoms.  Takes some of the joint swelling down, but only after sleeping (i.e. not doing ANYTHING with my body). Doesn't help with pain management unless taken with an opiate analgesic. So far, only side effects experienced are moderate headache (especially if I don't eat), insomnia (only 4-5 hours sleep instead of 7-8) and excruciating shoulder pain about 5 hours after dose.  Ironic, considering I'm trying to stop the joint pain.  Still, much better.",Anonymous
