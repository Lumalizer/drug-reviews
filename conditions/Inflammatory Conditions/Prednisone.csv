Prednisone made me feel worse. Also within 5 days taking it, retained 4 lbs of water weight. Tapered off of it having highly sensitive back pain. This medication is a nightmare. Do not take for covid, most doctors I spoke to after telling them it made me feel worse said that was never the right call to make taking this drug.",Bmill
1,Prednisone,Inflammatory Conditions,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"December 3, 2021",0,"Throbbing pain in hip and lower back began a week ago. Nothing worked and at night it was unbearable, and getting worse. Day 7 and 15 minutes of sleep and I woke in agony and immediately went to urgent care, where doctor said it wasn’t arthritis, but some kind of nerve pain. Gave me a weeks worth of prednisone 20 mg. Within 2 hours I could feel the inflammation and pain dissipate and by hour 6 I was slumped over in sleepiness as the adrenaline rush from the pain stopped. I slept 10 hours in no pain. My entire back feels better. I have scoliosis and spina bifida occulta and my back has been hurting since I was 10. Last night I could even turn my neck.This is not a good drug to use all the time but I believe when it works, doctors have a better understanding of what is going on. So many localized aches are really due to systemic inflammation.",Anonymous

4,Prednisone,Inflammatory Conditions,5.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"October 2, 2021",0,"I got vaccinated back in March 2021 but I got Covid19 in August. I recovered after 2 weeks and 4 weeks after my initial COVID-19 positive test it became hard to breathe and my blood pressure was so high! I never had any health issues before but this was so scary I went to the ER twice. Both times they told me everything looked normal and my oxygen was at 99-100%. They did xrays on my lungs and there was a bit of inflammation so they gave me 50mg of prednisone for 5 days. I immediately started retaining water, i was dizzy, jittery and lightheaded. I became very thirsty and peeing so much. I am now 3 days off of prednisone and although getting better from the side effects I still feel dizzy, thirsty and feeling hot and dizzy. I truly will never take something like this again. My doctor said I would have mood swings and be hungry but nothing else. I had to research all i was feeling to make sense of what was happening to me and why my face was so swollen suddenly.",Raquel
5,Prednisone,Inflammatory Conditions,2.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"July 16, 2021",0,"I have received cortisone with pain med for trochanteric hip bursitis with sciatica and it gives relief immediately with severe pain and days after pain free.  Due to COVID 19 I went a year without any injections but taking celicoxib 200 mg  (Celebrex) every other day.  The PA this year gave me a 10 mg. prednisone taper with 60 mg. the first day.  I’m still in pain, unable to sit or lying down for any length of time for rest.  This Prednisone dosage has been very painful to my stomach and digestive track, causing diarrhea and a rapid heart rate; unable to sleep and no pain relief!  What is the purpose of changing the protocol for treatment when the previous treatment worked?  Plus it’s a $40 copayment each visit and copayment with injections but at least they help alleviate the pain and inflammation quickly. Prednisone has more side effects and for a senior citizen with multiple health issues that complicate treatment; to me trigger point injections would be a better option.",Gma

I was only 15 years old, still in school, taking up to 22 pills a day and with preexisting mental illness. I wasn’t warned about the psychological effects. Originally on 40mg, it was too intense so I begged to go down to 30mg.  I felt like I was losing my mind along side the intense physical effects. I wasn’t prepared for either, my rheumatologist lowered my dosage too much and too fast the first time and acted like I was delusional which didn’t help. I almost got kidney failure at 10mg.

To me it is a miracle drug for the many conditions (knee osteoarthritis, allergic bronchitis (COVID) breathing problems), possible adrenal gland insufficiency, prostate enlargement, intestinal bowel syndrome), I have had.  I have had to go to an out of country pharmacy as most doctors will not use in long term.  I have experimented on dosage, frequency, etc. Have tapered off several times just to have my quality life lessen and pain recurring.  Currently on 20 mg a day as this dosage is 'ideal' for my conditions.   I am fully aware of the side effects, dangers, weight gain, sleeplessness,  bone density reduced, etal, adrenal gland atrophy, but life is a risk and I would rather has a quality of life better than just surviving.",vonwoomer

11,Prednisone,Inflammatory Conditions,10.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"August 1, 2020",15,"Rayos (prednisone):Most people don’t know what Polymyalgia rheumatica (PMR) is, but it comes on fast and strong and pretty quickly you can’t raise your arms over your head or walk normally. Pain and stiffness as if you ran a marathon yesterday and your legs are full of cement. One dose of prednisone after suffering for two months and finally some relief!  But you have to continue taking it for 1+ years, tapering down to the smallest effective dose, until (hopefully) it goes into remission. The usual negative side effects of prednisone apply, which reduce as your dose does. I started on regular generic prednisone at 20 mg. Switched to Rayos delay release at 10 mg seven months in. Rayos is great—no GI problems and you take it before bed so it is working when you get up. Less morning pain. Prednisone is the only treatment that works for PMR, so you might as well embrace it.",Sarahmay

I had been coughing up large volumes of phlegm, my nose would not stop running and my ears had been plugged for months. At 60mg/day as a starting dose, I had a fair amount of side effects (water retention, thirst, swelling knees, blurred vision, night sweats and overeating). It also WORKED!! It took almost two years to completely taper off Prednisone. While at 25mg/Day I would have NO side effects but all my other symptoms would disappear: no joint pains, no rhinitis, no vitiligo, no UC, and best of all, no EP. My only problem has been trying to find a doctor that is willing to prescribe it for life. After 6 mths off, my symptoms have all returned to some degree.

Usually when I've reached a point when pain meds aren't working I give in to an injection and a steroid taper. Steroids weaken the immune system so if you're body is currently fighting an infection, that you may be unaware of, the infection can become full blown since your body can't fight it off.... and this happened to me. I ended up with shingles of the mouth. Excruciatingly painful. I am now prone to getting shingles if I'm not careful. I think prednisone is a gamble. Take if you have reached a point of not having too many other options. Try a higher dose of NSAIDs for a week if no reprieve then steroids. Best of luck.",Talkinmomma

I was in terrible pain and had to use the bathroom about 20 times a day. I was hospitalized with dehydration and vomiting and the extreme diarrhea. After six days on a high dosage I was much better and sent home on a maintenance regimen of 10 mg. per day. This therapy did not cure my condition but cut down on my frequent hospitalizations. So, to make a long story shorter I was prescribed prednisone in differing strengths for twenty years. At that point prednisone had done so much harm to my body that I insisted on stopping it. I have developed severe osteoporosis and my back is starting to get a ""hump"". My skin is so thin that it is like tissue paper and I get bruises all over me.",brn2run2

This is my sixth year of dealing with excruciating herniated disc pain - L4/L5 and just this past month my cervical vertebrae (neck) had inflammation so severe I lost all feeling in my right arm. The pain has been almost unbearable. For the first time ever, I feel that my doctor has addressed the underlying cause, rather than just symptom management!!  I am almost afraid to get excited, because it feels almost too good to be true.  I even jogged today.  The only side effect I've experienced is a bit of weird moodiness thankfully recognized and controllable, and nothing compared to the near nervous-breakdowns I was having because of the pain.
