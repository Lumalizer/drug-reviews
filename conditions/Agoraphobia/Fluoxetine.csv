1,Fluoxetine,Agoraphobia,5,Taken for less than 1 month,"August 23, 2020",3,I'm 51 and have always had severe anxiety and mild agoraphobia from time to time. Doctor gave me 20mg of fluoxetine and I'm on day 6 and feel so bad.  I can't go out and my anxiety has hit the roof and I have lost 6 lbs in weight in 7 days !!! I can't swallow food or drink or even my saliva without feeling panic as my throat just goes so tight. I hope this prozac works,Tanya
2,Fluoxetine,Agoraphobia,9,,"June 30, 2020",6,"fluoxetine saved my life.Had been suffering from bulimia, OCD, anxiety and depression for years.I got prescribed this medication and felt better after 2 weeks of treatment.This medication does negatively affect the ability to orgasm and empathize at times, but well worth the positives of no being in hospital.",Ch_1999
3,Fluoxetine,Agoraphobia,9,,"October 12, 2018",32,"I have been struggling with anxiety attacks, panic attacks  and agoraphobia  all my life. I used to vomit before  school every morning, I had severe panic attacks, headaches and lots of more and they turned to agoraphobia in my 30s.  I fainted several times and became scared of driving or being out. I have been on prozac on and off. I tried other medicines but this one was the best. I always put on  lots of weight when I am on antidepressants so it makes me discontinue . This time I am going to stick on prozac. The first weeks the side effects are bad but you start feeling better.  I am still agoraphobic when I go out on my own thats why I want to do neurofeedback. But comparing to what I used to feel before prozac, I am feeling so much better. You will be a new person I promise ! Just stick to your medication and get as much support as you can. Keep yourself busy, stay positive. Search for anxiety support pages online . . Little steps little steps.. tomorrow is a better day.",kindness1
