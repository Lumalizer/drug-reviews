0,Potassium Chloride,Prevention of Hypokalemia,5.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"February 23, 2021",13,"My doctor started me on 10 mg. After a month my potassium levels didn't change, so she put me on 20 mg a day. A month later my levels were the same, so she had me take two 20 mg pills a day. After two weeks, my potassium was normal. She told me to continue with that dosage. The following week I started getting stomach pains. The pains were mild, but I had it for five days. After reading that stomach pains was one of the more common side effects of the drug, I stopped taking them completely and the pain subsided by the next day. While I'm glad the pills brought my levels up to normal, I have no doubt that my stomach issues were caused by the potassium",Scotty

2,Potassium Chloride,Prevention of Hypokalemia,,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"September 19, 2019",11,Husband has been taking 240 meq./ day KCL ER tabs per cardiologist. Maintains low normal K levels but has had 1 perforated ulcer/almost died plus another gastric bleed hospitalization with transfusion. Dr’s all say it should not cause this - all the literature shows the ER tabs are hardest on gastric area. Switched to liquid and/or dissolvable powder and no problems at all.
