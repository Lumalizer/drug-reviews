0,Infliximab,Crohn's Disease Maintenance,9.0,Taken for 10 years or more,"January 14, 2022",1,"Remicade (infliximab):I have had Crohns for the past 17 years. Diagnosed at 21. They put me on remicade and pentasa right away. Worked so well at the time they thought they misdiagnosed me and they took me off everything.  I was good for maybe 3-4 months and it came roaring back. 2 years battling with prednisone, imuran etc I finally got back on Remicade in 2008 and have been on for going on 14 years. Since the 2nd or 3rd infusion back in 2008 I've had Zero symptoms. No signs of Crohns at all. The only side effect is about 8-9 years ago I got scalp psoriasis and have battled it since.  I see a specialist outside Boston who noted that although Remicade is also used to treat psoriasis it can cause about 5 percent of people taking it for other reasons to develop psoriasis.  The immune system is a very complex thing for sure. I get remicade every 8 weeks.  Doesn't make me tired or sore.  Knock on wood. So if your reading this and have lost all hope, there is hope",Kyle

I also had 2 healthy babies while on Remicade.  I was diagnosed with CD of my ilium at 20 years old. I had been on Pentasa and then Imuran.  Imuran worked okay, but it hurt my stomach and I never felt truly ""good"".  I was put on Remicade after my last blockage in 2006, and I have been in true remission ever since with Remicade alone. I am a little tired after my infusion for a day, but then I feel totally normal.  My two kids had no side effects from using during pregnancy.  They are now 6 and 3.  I had 2 c-sections, with no complications.  The only thing it affected, was that my kids couldn't get the Rotavirus vaccine, because it was a live vaccine. (No live vaccines until 6 months for Remicade babies).  That vaccine is new and not critical.  Remicade has a payment assistance program and they help with co-pays, regardless of income.",Linds

Being put on the higher dose may help. But with the side effects, it's very hard to have a good quality of life. Had surgery in my 20's for it. Maybe that's the best option now.

I’m am also still taking azothioprine as a precaution so that my body doesn’t build immunity to the infliximab. It took about 3-4 months for it to work. Prior to taking it I had suffered a particularly bad 2 year flare, lost 35kg, hospitalisation, brought my marriage to the brink and I was contemplating the unthinkable. I can’t help crying as I write this as I remember what it was like. Reaching that point, it was worth the potential risks with the hope of being normal again. As I enter my third year of infusions, I am aware that the drugs effectiveness can wear off and I am praying it doesn’t. I am very fortunate to live in country that covers the cost of the infusions which would otherwise be financially devastating.

Then August of 2017 got cellulitis in the right arm, a very painful infection requiring a seven day stay in the hospital on antibiotics followed by a week long IV administration at home.
