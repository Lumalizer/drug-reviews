0,Metronidazole,Crohn's Disease Maintenance,10.0,Taken for 10 years or more,"February 6, 2021",0,I have Crohn's with complications ie.. fistula. I took metronidazole  for 10 years straight. And all that I could say negative is the metallic taste. UGH couldn't stand it. And headaches. But I honestly believe that it has kept my fistula under control. I never needed surgery. And never had issues. I stopped metronidazole in 2001. And I have had little flares over the years. But the fistula was not effected.  Up until the Pandemic. Now I am back on this drug. And I hope that it will work for me the same way it has in the past. Yes it's strong but is definitely a good antibiotic.  And I actually trust this one more than others. Because there is always some kind of issue with antibiotics. Yeast etc.. Where as metronidazole it was just another pill I had to take with no side effects.,MoinPA
1,Metronidazole,Crohn's Disease Maintenance,8.0,Taken for 10 years or more,"October 12, 2016",1,"Having Crohn's for 15+ years, a resection under my belt 13 years ago and several flares.....this medicine is my doctors go to med to treat my flares along with predisone. The metallic taste is horrific but within a week of taking this med 3 times daily with other meds, it does the trick (but I do finish the 14 day treatment). I take nausea medicine an hour before the flagyl as I do get nauseated also. The side effects are horrible no doubt, but when dealing with a Crohn's flare, there isn't else worse than the havoc Crohn's is wrecking in our bodies anyways.",hjsimp
2,Metronidazole,Crohn's Disease Maintenance,10.0,,"May 21, 2016",6,"Flagyl (metronidazole):Long time Crohn's after 5 small bowel resections I started getting bouts of intestinal bacteria that caused bloating, cramping and gas. This is the Only drug that helps. My GI now has me take it 2 times daily the first 5 days of each month which helps get the bacteria at bay. Hate the taste so take it with juice.",HeyJude18
3,Metronidazole,Crohn's Disease Maintenance,,,"September 29, 2015",3,"Flagyl (metronidazole):I have Crohn's disease as well and was fine getting the flagyl by IV, but when switching to the pill form the vomiting started again.My doctor stopped that treatment and proceeded with the next phase of the Cizmia Injections Treatments which are working much better so far.",Lisa Atwell
4,Metronidazole,Crohn's Disease Maintenance,,,"September 7, 2015",5,"Flagyl (metronidazole):My little guy was prescribed this to help treat a fistula and possible Crohn's. He's showing no signs of Crohn's and had been on this about 30 days. He's now vomiting when he takes it in pill form. It tastes awful. I thought he was just being dramatic so I tasted it. I think the taste stayed in my mouth for three hours! Right now I'm not sure if he had a bug or this medicine is too harsh for his stomach. However, it seems to be helping to close the fistula...the jury is still out on this medication.",M&MsMommy
