2,Azathioprine,Crohn's Disease Maintenance,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"October 7, 2020",0,This medicine azathioprine made me have terrible migraines from just one dose.  Took 5 pills for 250mgs and had a migraine for 3 days straight.  I wanted to cry.  I really wanted this medication to work along with my humira since the doctor said they go together.  I wanted it to work so much that I tried it again...this time 4 pills and had the same reaction.  I will never try this medicine again.  They put this medicine as an allergy on my chart.  It's sad because my Crohn's isn't under control and I wished my body would tolerate this machine but for some reason it can't.,Jade

6,Azathioprine,Crohn's Disease Maintenance,,Taken for less than 1 month,"March 17, 2019",6,Hi guys I just started taking 50mg of azathioprine and am also on prednisolone. I have heard that the azathioprine can thin your skin and make you burn easily in the sun. Any truth in this?,maialz
7,Azathioprine,Crohn's Disease Maintenance,1.0,,"May 31, 2018",4,"I've had Crohn's Disease for 43 years and have been on everything. Each new GI doc I get seems to love Azathioprine.It has never, ever, ever done anything for me.On the plus side, it hasn't given me any side effects either.Note: historically, they have prescribed a low dose, 50mg I believe. Then I finally got a doc who knew that the dose needs to be a ""therapeutic"" dose which is higher (in my case 3.5 times higher) - they'll know the correct dosage by bloodwork.",WheresTheBathroom
8,Azathioprine,Crohn's Disease Maintenance,9.0,Taken for 10 years or more,"September 27, 2017",30,"Imuran (azathioprine):I was diagnosed with Crohn's 28 years ago and have been on multiple medications over the years. I had a flare up in January of 2000 after being admitted to the hospital for a failing appendix. That is where I met my current Gastro Doctor. I was put on Imuran with a side of Asacol, but was taken off the Asacol around 7 years ago. I have been taking 100mg of Imuran for 16 years with virtually no side effects and haven't had one flare up to speak of since 2000. I know everyone is different, but Imuran has been super good to me!",RjS30

Currently taken Imuran 50mg and now that I have been on it for a few month I have been getting nausea every time I take it.  Zofran does not even help they are talking about doing the infusion now.

10,Azathioprine,Crohn's Disease Maintenance,9.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"January 8, 2016",38,"Imuran (azathioprine):Our son was very sick for a year before being diagnosed with Crohns Disease, at his worst he was 62 lbs and 12 years old! The poor sweet thing was withering away to nothing! Every bone in his body stuck out It was a terrible time for the entire family to see such a sweet soul struggle so badly. Once we got the diagnosis of Crohns via biopsy and scope his Dr put him on Imuran. 7 months later he now weighs 78lbs and grew almost an inch! He is in remission!!!!!!!!!!!! We are so thankful for this prescription!",MySonhasCrohnsDisease

I switched to Remicade and was doing well until the 6th infusion when I contracted Drug Induced Lupos. After a short time with Prednisone I went back on Imuran. After 3 years I seem to be doing well (no flare-ups), etc. I do have a lot of trouble with my skin. I don't know if the Imuran has anything to do with that or not.",G Eagle
12,Azathioprine,Crohn's Disease Maintenance,10.0,Taken for 5 to 10 years,"October 31, 2014",4,Have been on azathioprine for 7 years for Crohn's maintenance and have not had a single relapse in this time.  Had previously had allergic reaction but for some reason I now seem to be able to take it.  Currently suffering from dizziness but doubt this is to do with the azathioprine as I have had it so long.  Found that it works very quickly for me when I start taking it and is a lot better than being on steroids.,Leviathin
13,Azathioprine,Crohn's Disease Maintenance,7.0,,"February 6, 2010",27,"Imuran (azathioprine):I have had Crohn's disease for 19 years and have been on many different medications. I have been hospitalized 6 times, where they shut down the colon to leave it to rest (no surgeries).  I have taken Imuran for 7 years and until last month have only had 4 flareups to account for, my doctors put me on a steroid  (not something that you want to take a lot of). For me this is usually about a 2-3 month process.  Unfortunately, my thyroid has gone from hypo to hyper and my Crohn's disease and blood pressure is out of control.  So my doctors have suggested I try Remicade...I have just had my second infusion, still taking Imuran, and 30mg of steroid, hoping to see some results soon.",sheila01
