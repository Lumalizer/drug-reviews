2,Mesalamine,Crohn's Disease Maintenance,1.0,Taken for 10 years or more,"November 6, 2021",1,"Pentasa (mesalamine):500 mg x 4.  Took it for duration of disease (30 years). My GI was negligent.  Disease was never fully active in her care. Early on, she expressed doubt that I had Crohn’s disease until pathology came back positive. Disease became active after 28 years of mild inflammation. GI dismissed my complaints (only believes colonoscopy, referred back to last colonoscopy as evidence) until new colonoscopy revealed fistula. Referred to new GI who said I had never been treated for Crohn’s disease because Pentasa doesn’t work for fistulizing  Crohn’s. Inflammatory polyps were present and removed at every single colonoscopy with the negligent GI. New GI used biologic, zero inflammation at colonoscopy.  Pentasa - easy to take. Does nothing for your Crohn’s. Inflammatory polyps should not exist if treatment is working. It isn’t preventing inflammation if you have INFLAMMATION.",Sarah

Bloody diarrhea constantly so much I had to stop working. I started on Pentasa about a month ago and for the 1st time in 30 yrs have had solid BMs and no bleeding. It’s like a miracle drug for me. Dr wants me to take it as a suppository at night along with 500 mg capsules 3x/day. The capsules cost $250/m copay ($2,500 reg price) but medicare won’t cover the suppositories which are $9,000!

I was diagnosed with Crohns disease three years ago after I had severe rectal bleeding for the third time in three months.  I was put on Prednisone for four weeks then 6-MP.  A week later I ended up in the ER.  It took the hospital six days to find out what was wrong with me but finally diagnosed sepsis.  The 6-MP was replaced with Budesonide for a month then I began taking two Pentasa pills four times a day.  The Pentasa seems to be working perfectly.  I have a few minor side effects but some or all may come from by heart medicines.,Bud
10,Mesalamine,Crohn's Disease Maintenance,,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"February 26, 2019",32,"Pentasa (mesalamine):Hi, I’m 19 and turning 20. I was diagnosed with Crohn’s last March and was taking Pentasa, and it works great, but when I switched to United Healthcare, they wouldn’t cover it. They then prescribed me Apriso. If your Crohn’s is specific to your small intestine and not your colon, please don’t take Apriso. Apriso is meant to target your colon. I went back to the hospital for the third time because of it, so it was decided that I should go back onto Pentasa. It really works for those who aren’t sure about it. It really does. I was in severe pain for months until Pentasa. It’s kept the pain away and let me get back to a normal diet. For those who were on Pentasa and were forced to change medication due to insurance, you can dispute to your insurance that you need it. It took 2 months to do it, for me, but it worked out. My insurance now will cover it. Good luck to those with Crohn’s and/or are having trouble finding medication or can’t take Pentasa, anymore.",Mack
