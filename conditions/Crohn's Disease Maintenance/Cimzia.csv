1,Cimzia,Crohn's Disease Maintenance,10,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"June 4, 2012",22,Cimzia manufacturer covers copays. Have to renew each year. Can't work as nurse without it. Inject every 3 wks.,LORNA DOONE
2,Cimzia,Crohn's Disease Maintenance,10,,"February 29, 2012",17,"I was able to use CimPay to cover my $350/month copay. I was in such total remission that it felt like I didn't even have Crohns. Loved not going to hospital for Remicade infusions and had no problems with injections or any side effects. Unfortunately, now have been exposed to TB and am positive for Latent TB Infection and must discontinue Cimzia. Abdominal pain restarted at just one week past missed dose, so have been prescribed Pentasa.",Anonymous
3,Cimzia,Crohn's Disease Maintenance,10,,"February 15, 2011",19,This medicine has given me my life back. I no longer worry about knowing where every rest room is wherever I go. My only side effect is a headache the day after the injections.,Narbe

5,Cimzia,Crohn's Disease Maintenance,10,,"April 8, 2009",44,"I was diagnosed with Crohns Disease a while ago and was hurting non stop. I lost over 15 pounds in 2 weeks. After about 4 months of being on Cimzia I don't even worry about my stomach. Maintain a good diet, take your vitamins, and drink plenty of water. Cimzia seems like a miracle drug.",NoWorries
