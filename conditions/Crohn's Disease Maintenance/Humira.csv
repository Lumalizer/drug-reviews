I'm always on laxatives and linzess now. This all started 2 months after I started Humira so I'm thinking the medication switch made me worse. And man are the headaches bad.  I had some issues here and there on my passed medication but now I'm worse off. I decided to change my doctor I'm thinking a lot of this is his fault,  humira has lessened my symptoms but I'm developing new ones so that's not good.",Chad

I have had severe diarrhea my whole life. I finally found out I have Crohn's in 2013. I have been on Humira since then. It does absolutely nothing for the symptoms the only thing it did was take away my intestinal ulcers. I have constant cellulitis infections in my skin even to the point of having a abscesses which had to be surgically removed, urinary tract infections, major headaches, and so many more side effects it’s unreal. But apparently I’m in remission. I suffer greatly everyday if this is remission I’m not sure I want to continue this path. To many cancer and deadly risks with this medicine. Just for some crappy ulcers to be gone. To top it all off I now have hidradenitis suppurativa, I can assure you it does nothing to help that the suffering is real.

7,Humira,Crohn's Disease Maintenance,9.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"November 16, 2018",15,"Hello everyone,I was diagnosed with Crohn's in 2015. I started on Pentasa which helped me for the first 6 months. I was having 4-5 loose stools every day and horrible abdominal pain. The quality of my life was going down. I lost 25 lbs at that time. In the beginning of this year, I decided to start Humira. I can say that now, after 9 months of taking it, my quality of life improved tremendously. I was able to gain my 25 lbs back, no pain, no diarrhea. The only thing I have to deal now, are the side effects. My headaches started a week ago and I am a little worried about it. Has anybody used Humira for longer than 4 years?  Also, has anybody suffered from heart failure  as a side effect of Humira?",Claudia

I was not taking HUMIRA at the time. My doctor said it was likely from the stress and trauma of my Crohn's flare. It happens sometimes. I tried all kind of hair vitamins and special products, but I didn’t see mine change until I started using Monat hair products. I was very sceptical of the products, but they worked! My hair had grown back and it feels super healthy. Products are pretty expensive but last a decent amount of time and are worth it. Good luck to you. I hope this helps!

Now I live an active life, raising kids and I'm very thankful because my life no longer rotates around my symptoms.  It's very sad to think back to when I was so sick. Of course I worry about the side effects, but had minor ones and it completely outweighs having acute Crohn's flares and multiple complications, hospitalizations.

While on Humira, my daughter has been hospitalized six times in 14 months and has had surgery to get a stuck camera pill out and then a perforated bowel.  I wouldn't say it has been working. I will say that the first time she had a dose, she felt hungry, which was wonderful.  But it was rather short lived.  We need to find something else.",Kat on the Keys

Through the generous Abbvie Patient Assistance program I was able to start Humira in December 2015. The change was quick and dramatic. Many symptoms either disappeared or lessened. At times eating certain foods bring on cramps but they can be managed.My only fear is that one year I will not be renewed in the Abbvie program. Medicare Part D has a copay which is quite high, well beyond my financial ability. This would result in loss of relief which Humira has provided.",Jolly Professor

The first 5 yrs was awesome! Small side effects like a few light infections in my eyes, athlete's foot, acne, and one time head rash (2 weeks) all had been good. The last 6 months have been a bit tougher. I have gotten some stomach pain back and had a few episodes so had to add Prednisone again.

28,Humira,Crohn's Disease Maintenance,9.0,,"July 28, 2016",30,"Humira has been amazing in treating my severe Crohn's. I used to suffer almost every time I'd eaten 7 days/week or unprovoked but now it's gone down to only once or twice. The only reason I'd rate it 9 instead of ten is because the initial injection burns very badly (the medication, not the needle) and can interrupt my day for an hour or so. The pain is worth the long term result. I highly recommend going for it if the option has been made available to you. I have two family members who use it too, one for Crohn's and one for arthritis and it's given them great success as well :)",Nicole MK

Nothing else worked and I was miserable with low quality of life. I still have to change my automatic way of thinking: scouting out nearest bathrooms, foregoing meals before social events, etc. I'm gradually branching out from my safe foods list (very small by the time I started Humira). The only side effect had been more severe allergies than usual and a few headaches here and there. The shots are extremely painful for me, but 10-15 seconds of extreme discomfort for 15 Crohn's-free days seems like a very fair trade. So thankful for this medication.",BMan1979

51,Humira,Crohn's Disease Maintenance,9.0,,"November 2, 2009",68,"I was diagnosed with Crohn's in 1993.  In 2006 I began to flare really badly.  I had a bowel resection, but was still having a lot of problems.  Finally, after spending 21 days in the hospital, my doctor recommended Humira.  It saved me.  Since starting the Humira, I have not been back in the hospital for my Crohn's.  I was even able to compete at a national sporting event this summer and deployed with my unit for the hurricanes last year.  If nothing else works, its worth a stick in the belly every couple of weeks to be able to be as close to normal as possible.",talfor24
