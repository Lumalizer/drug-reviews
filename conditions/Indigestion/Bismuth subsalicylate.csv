0,Bismuth subsalicylate,Indigestion,10.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"January 16, 2022",2,"Pepto-Bismol (bismuth subsalicylate):It is a must have in my medicine cabinet, knowing I have it makes me feel so secure. I occasionally (maybe once or twice a year) wake up with very horrible stomach pain, and it used to plague me for up to 48 hours, and I would constantly be worrying about the day it would come. Now, if I do experience stomach pains, taking a dose of pepto bismol eliminates the pain within 30 minutes. It is a miracle drug. I no longer live in fear.",ThankYou
1,Bismuth subsalicylate,Indigestion,1.0,,"March 6, 2021",1,"Pepto-Bismol (bismuth subsalicylate):I had a minor acid reflux this week. I didn't know which over the counter medicine to take and so I googled. I randomly ended up at pepto bismol and read some reviews. Most of the reviews were quite positive about the drug and so I went to the nearest walgreens and bought one. I took it for the next two days as directed however it never worked or I didn't get better! I got annoyed and ended up throwing it! I went ahead and bought Alka Selzer and got better immediately! In conclusion, Alka Selzer is great and pepto bismol is not!",Jack

4,Bismuth subsalicylate,Indigestion,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"January 14, 2020",1,"Horrible, low quality product! Hard as a rock to chew and does not dissolve well at all... nothing but hard gritty , nasty tasting chunks to try to get out of your mouth and teeth! Doesn't dissolve enough to actually help you in my experience. Just buy the real Pepto stuff and you'll be much happier and feel better.",Kat
5,Bismuth subsalicylate,Indigestion,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"January 7, 2020",0,"Had sudden onset of indigestion that sent acid up to the back of my throat. Antacid tablets did nothing to help. By late afternoon the next day I needed something, anything to make it stop. Called the Nurse Line on my insurance card, and she recommended something like Peptobismol. Was skeptical but had it on hand, so tried it. It worked perfectly, and because it can be used with greater frequency than other antacid treatments, I was able to take it seven times a day for 2 days, to let everything heal. Will not be without it. NOTE: be sure to drink plenty of water to prevent a problem at the other end:)",RockyColo

10,Bismuth subsalicylate,Indigestion,10.0,,"September 11, 2016",5,"Pepto-Bismol (bismuth subsalicylate):I've found pepto Bismol really useful for when I get acid reflux. It really helps to calm and cool my stomach. Anytime I'm feeling nauseous, it's the first thing I go to!I also take pepto bismol when I've eaten too much, as I do have a binge eating disorder. It helps prevent the reflux before it starts.I only take it when I'm experiencing symptoms.",A11ycat1234
