0,Omeprazole,Indigestion,1.0,Taken for 10 years or more,"January 29, 2022",3,"OMG!!! Reading all those reviews makes sense now as I’ve had similar experiences by taking omeprazole only when I was getting a flare up of a gout attack coming up as I had to take 20mg of it 1 hr before meal & after meal, colchicine & Voltaren 100. Been doing this for the last 15-20 years as been diagnosed with gout nearly 30 years ago when I was 18 years old.It’s been happening lately lets say a few years back when taking omeprazole that I have been getting symptoms of chronic fatigue, blurred vision, extreme anxiety, panic attacks, brain fog, muscle cramps, severe insomnia & depression. I cannot function at all specially in the mornings when I wake up and only start to function in late afternoon after pushing myself to exercise even with extreme fatigue so that I felt better afterwards as my body would produce endorphins and serotonins.My GP prescribed me antidepressant drugs also,I still feel horrible now writing this review :( THANK YOU to all of you for your reviews",RLS
1,Omeprazole,Indigestion,1.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"January 13, 2022",2,"The worst experience of my life this drug. I was prescribed 40mg per day. Was completely healthy all my life. No issues. All was OK for a few weeks until I started getting sensations of what I now know as anxiety. Tinnitus started then and I started to feel I had constant kidney problems. Went off these cold turkey and then the symptoms escalated. Severe weight loss over a 6 week period to the extent I had a biopsy. Could not eat solid foods for about 4 weeks. Kidneys were under huge pressure and had 4 antibiotics for infection. Jolting out of sleep at night, body tremors. Depression, never had anything like this in my life. I am now just over 6 months off of these toxic substances and am almost back to myself. The weight stayed off but I can eat healthily now. I upped vitamin intake. I have researched this and whatever these contain seems to work on the whole system-  to the organs of the body and neurologically as well. Horrific and avoidable experience",Sunshine
2,Omeprazole,Indigestion,2.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"October 21, 2021",14,"After having a colonoscopy & EDG test done in October 2020. My doctor put me on Omeprazole. I took it for a week, until I read the side affects & chose to go off of it. Two months later I had a telephone doctor visit. I told him the side affects that I read. (Which he tried to brush them off). I took his word & tried the medication again. Only to realize it weakened my immune system & I ended up with shingles twice. I decided to do my own research & rely on natural supplements. Probiotic has been the best for me, along with my vitamins & herbal supplements. I would never take this medicine long term. Please do your research before taking any medication.",dlb1954
3,Omeprazole,Indigestion,1.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"September 30, 2021",15,"I was prescribed this for Indigestion and a mild concentric ring on esophagus. Was advised it was safe. I don't take any other medications and am healthy. Took for less than 4 months and the side effects started into the 4th month - Tinnitus, depression, anxiety, panic. Never knew what these were until I took this. Stopped it straight away after researching this. The withdrawals were horrendous. Depression, anxiety, kidney problems - 2 antibiotics to treat. Lost over 2 stone in weight the first few weeks as couldn't eat.  Appetite returned after about 6 weeks. Went to see a functional medicine practitioner and am taking natural remedies which are helping hugely.  I was glad to find this site and some other to know that this is what was causing all this. I am over 3 months of now and things are lifting. I read most people's recovery takes 3 to 6 months.  I will never take this again and I will research anything I am ever advised to take with a degree of intense analysis.",Sunlight
4,Omeprazole,Indigestion,10.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"September 23, 2021",1,"I had moderate acid reflux that eventually caused esophagus inflammation and trouble swallowing.  I tried Pepcid AC with no perceivable improvement.  The 40 mg omeprazole was nearly immediate in improving acid reflux and ended my swallowing difficulty.  Shortly after I saw improvements, I reduced dosage to 20 mg daily and I have not had to use antacid tablets in months. Highly recommend.  After my prescription is over I plan to continue with the 20mg over the counter.",Anonymous
5,Omeprazole,Indigestion,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"July 19, 2021",2,"I was prescribed this pill for heartburn/acid reflux I experienced as a result of food poisoning. I took this pill yesterday afternoon and experienced stomach pain, nausea, heartburn, acid reflux, insomnia, anxiety, and heart racing. I will not be continuing this pill!!! I take Pepcid or natural alternatives like baking soda, ACV & Aloe Vera Juice. This medicine also states that it does not provide immediate relief for heartburn. This was not a good experience for me.",Anonymous

9,Omeprazole,Indigestion,3.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"April 18, 2021",19,"Was prescribed 20mg a day for indigestion and suspected stomach ulcer as having sharp pains upper stomach as well as heartburn and indigestion. Took capsule in the morning 30 mins before breakfast. Helped the indigestion but I have severe dizziness where I feel drunk or doped up, chest and stomach pain and my anxiety is through the roof. After 7 tablets I ended up going to hospital as I thought I was having a heart attack. I was examined and told my anxiety was driving my stomach and chest pain.That maybe the case, however the omeprazole was definitely driving the anxiety.I'm quitting this medication from tomorrow and pray I feel and get better.",Crystal
10,Omeprazole,Indigestion,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"March 16, 2021",16,"Took this medicine for 8 days. On the third day started to feel awful. Brain fog, high anxiety and depression. Blurry vision and tingly feeling in hands and feet. I have now been off of it for 5 days and feeling like I’m losing my mind. I can’t work. I’m going to check my b12 levels tomorrow to determine if I am deficient. I hope this passes or eases up soon because I can barely even sleep. I thought it was a reaction to my first vaccine (Pfizer) until a friend told me omeprozole did this to him as well. What an awful drug. I’d recommend an all natural remedy over this any day.",Dee
11,Omeprazole,Indigestion,1.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"March 10, 2021",49,Omg I have just read these omeprazole reviews I just thank each and everyone of you for sharing your experiences as you have solved my health issues that I have been suffering for a year and a half probably longer. I even went to see my cardiologist and went through an angiogram as I felt so bad. Pains in my chest going through to my back and down my arms. My cardiologist said my arteries were all clear  and these feelings must have been down to your sotalol beta blockers giving you side effects. I have just spent 4 nights in hospital trying to get to the bottom of these horrendous feelings. And by reading your reviews on Omeprazole I'm sure that's whats wrong with me. As you say it is one awful drug as its ruined my life for the past 2 years I would say. THANK YOU FOR SHARING,Smudgetootsie

13,Omeprazole,Indigestion,2.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"January 4, 2021",12,"Took omeprazole for 5 months and am still reeling from the side effects that apparently don't exist! Random muscle spasms, complete pelvic/urinary failure including retention and inflammation which I previously didn't have!I haven't had reflux in a while and been off the meds for at least 5 months now, know what fixed my stomach? Diet filled with veg and cutting back on sugar and the western diet rubbish!Now I just need to fix my bladder and inflammation but I will never use a western medicine ever again!",Angry
14,Omeprazole,Indigestion,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"December 1, 2020",36,"omeprazole caused extreme anxiety, feeling like I am life is a struggle, panic attacks, weight loss(10kgs in 5 weeks), palpitations, chest and arm pain on left side, brain fog, weakness and chills in legs and arms, dizziness, nausea, general fatigue, numbness, flatulence, joint pain (hip) after gentle walks, forgetfulness, fear of eating.I have stopped cold turkey after having come across reviews of Omeprazole and Protonix which I took as well. Took Omeprazole for 2 weeks, got these symptoms, told the doctor who changed the med to be pantoprazole(protonix).The last 2.5 months or so have been the worst of my life so far, it has taken a toll on my family and work life too. Doctor thought I might need anti depressants given all the anxiety but after around a week or so of stopping these, I am starting to feel a bit better. So, I am not going to take anti anxiety related meds. It is a vicious cycle, PPIs cause depression and then you take depression meds that are difficult to stop!",Swiftdesire
15,Omeprazole,Indigestion,3.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"August 13, 2020",63,"I have had heartburn for years. I was put on this omeprazole medication and it worked well for my heartburn. However after about 2 months or so I began to feel symptoms that I couldn't pin to one thing or another. Back aches, light headedness, fatigue, anxiety, shoulder pain and my rib cage felt like I got beat up. Also if felt like a basket ball was in my stomach. So I started chasing down side effects with the meds I take and started to see ALL these side effects tied to this drug. I am now on day 2 of not taking them. I just hope it is not too long before the side effects start to subside.",Royalrider
16,Omeprazole,Indigestion,3.0,,"August 7, 2020",19,"I would like to share my experience with omeprazole. Works great in reduce my stomach pain and hernia as I have IBS, but I forget important thinking from the every day life. I don't need to take it often, but when I do, as soon as I start taking it my short time memory goes weird. Not only me, my brother in law take this medication every single day, as he got heartburn. This is about 10 years ago. He lost his job, family and have personal problems with everybody because his funny memory that I 100% attribute to this medicine. Nobody believed me, yesterday I left a sandwich maker on...thanks goodness nothing happened.  Never Ever in my life happened this to me, as I have good memory and I am extremely careful in everything I do.. 4 years using this medicine now an then... But I will try another alternative. Isn't fun at all...",Unicorn blue

18,Omeprazole,Indigestion,1.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"June 27, 2020",16,I started to have an irritation at the back of my throat which then became a bit sore. The doctor thought it could be acid reflux (Which I doubt it was) so gave me omeprazole. It worked for the first two days but then made my throat worse and my anxiety went through the roof. After three weeks went back to the doctors and was given nexium and not only did that work but my anxiety went right down. When my nexium finished my doctor put me back omeprazole and again my anxiety has increased. I have stopped taking it for the last 3 days now and I can now feel my anxiety coming down. Never going back to that. Will try through natural remedies instead. Would not recommend it at all,Yasmeen

20,Omeprazole,Indigestion,3.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"May 9, 2020",54,I've been talking Omeprazole for over a week now... I had a bad indigestion that lasted 4 days and the doctor told me to take the medication for 2 weeks. Right now I cant stop belching.. anything I eat gives so much gas (bloating too). I'm starting to thinking after reading this reviews that all my symptoms are because of omeprazole. I also feel nauseous before sleep .. and gives me this empty stomach feeling even after I ate.. (I think is all the gas). I wanna stop taking it but I don't want to get worse like some people are saying.,Trish
21,Omeprazole,Indigestion,1.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"May 8, 2020",23,Was put on this horrific pill omeprazole 2018. What a nightmare I am going through. I lost 3 stone.

23,Omeprazole,Indigestion,9.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"January 30, 2020",6,"My doctor prescribed this because I would have anxiety so bad to the point I would throw up every morning before school and always have to go home early. It’s worked so well! It does make me a bit dizzy sometimes, but I take it once every morning and I still get anxious, just not to the point I throw up anymore :)",luna
24,Omeprazole,Indigestion,1.0,,"December 26, 2019",30,"I was advised by my GP to take omeprazole 20mg daily. September 2019 my anxiety heightened to the point where I was unable to live on my own and I developed severe abdominal pain, muscle spasms, and extreme fatigue. I recently worked out that my acid levels had decreased drastically and I dropped from 8 Stone 7 to 7 stone 5. I ended up hospitalised on several occasions and only recently I decided to stop taking omeprazole. I’ve reintroduced more acidic foods back into my diet, I’m able to drink milk again and my stomach and mental health have improved immensely. My advice is that if you can control your stomach acid related problems thorough your diet then please use this as your first line of defence. Omeprazole just masks the symptoms and does not address the underlining issue. It’s still very early days for me but I hope and pray that I’m finally on the road to my recovery and I can start rebuilding my life once again.",LWM
25,Omeprazole,Indigestion,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"December 6, 2019",10,"I've had a heartburn for a while now that I'm 43 years old. Nothing serious, but doesn't look nice. I'm originally from Russia so I hoped that amazing American doctors with high salaries and exorbitantly priced pills will definitely solve the minor condition problem. Not at all!  The second day of Omeprazole I felt more nervous than usual but I thought it was just one of those days. Second day - sweating, panic attack and almost burst into tears in a restaurant over bad American sushis. Could be funny but third day - cooking dinner in the kitchen and crying! That all is not typical for me. I'm grateful for this site because I can repeat after one of the reviewer here- THIS IS POISON. I'm off omeprazole and not going back to the primary care who prescribed it. We paid 7 dollars and insurance 100 dollars for this garbage!",Lisabeth1976

29,Omeprazole,Indigestion,6.0,,"October 11, 2019",16,"I've been taking Omeprazole for about five months for indigestion and GERD. The Omeprazole has flat put a stop to those problems but may be contributing to some other issues. During the time I've been taking Omeprazole, I've also been diagnosed as being anemic. In doing some reading on anemia I learned that one possible cause is a B12 deficiency. I also read that a contributing factor to B12 deficiency is using a Proton Pump Inhibitor (PPI). Omeprazole is a PPI. I'm not suggesting that Omeprazole is the sole cause of my anemia but I suspect it is a contributing factor. I quit taking Omeprazole about a week ago and there have definitely been some withdrawal symptoms. The indigestion has rebounded with a vengeance. It is worse than it was before I started on the Omeprazole. I've also been somewhat weak and light headed. These are known withdrawal symptoms that apparently can last from two weeks to three months. Omeprazole will surely stop indigestion  but I'm not sure it's worth it.",Randy
