0,Famotidine,Indigestion,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"January 27, 2022",0,"I’m not one to leave reviews on anything but I just got home from the ER tonight. The only thing they could come up with was e-coli in my stool. I started to think of what I’ve changed the past two weeks because that’s when my body literally began to shut down and show the horrible symptoms I’m experiencing now. It was like a light bulb moment for me….I started using this medicine at the exact time my issues began. I’m so thankful I found this forum to read and share my experience. OMG, I literally thought I was going to die this morning!  I’ve experience HORRIBLE anxiety, insomnia, doom and gloom feelings of hopelessness, SEVERE body aches, chest pain, twitching, diarrhea, and HORRIBLE stomach pain. I think it honestly just reached an all time high in my body and caused me to have a break down.  The doctors didn’t even think to mention it being a reason to anything I’ve been experiencing. DO NOT TAKE!",STAY AWAY!!!

2,Famotidine,Indigestion,7.0,,"November 14, 2020",9,"Famotidine is not the most effective thing I've taken for heartburn (Prevacid is awesome but gives me headaches), but it's helpful for cases where Rolaids and Pepto Bismol don't give me relief. I feel just a bit off when I take it, but I'd rather feel out of it for a few hours instead of suffering through wicked heartburn.",Anonymous

In MarchI thought I had maybe gotten the Corona-19, I had sore throat, headaches, about 100 fever, and felt bad. this only lasted about a few days.
