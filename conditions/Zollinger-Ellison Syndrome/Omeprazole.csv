0,Omeprazole,Zollinger-Ellison Syndrome,10,Taken for 10 years or more,"November 2, 2014",51,"Prilosec (omeprazole):I have a hiatal hernia which can cause bad reflux, etc. I've been taking Prilosec at least ten years (probably closer to fifteen) and I've never had ANY negative side effects. It has been invaluable for relieving the inflammation and irritation associated with reflux, gastritis, GERD, etc. Awesome medicine, never had any interaction issues, and I'm on a number of serious medicines (heart, blood pressure, anti- anxiolytics, and pain meds). I'm 58, and will probably be taking it as long as I'm around. Great medicine.",neuralgear
