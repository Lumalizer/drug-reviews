0,Modafinil,Chronic Fatigue Syndrome,1.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"February 14, 2022",0,"I was prescribed modafinil for chronic fatigue and brain fog. The first week, my doctor had me take 1/2 a pill for a week then move to 1 pill a day thereafter. The first week I noticed a big difference and when I started taking the whole pill I was blown away by my energy and desire to get things done. HOWEVER, after being on it for about a month, the energy and desire to do anything was completely gone. My fatigue was worse than before and started having suicidal tendencies and horrible thoughts towards people I know and love. I realized it was time to stop and did cold turkey and I'm worse than I was before I started taking it.",Not a fan

7,Modafinil,Chronic Fatigue Syndrome,6.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"February 19, 2021",18,"I've been on this for well over a year (close to 2). I saw minimal improvement for cognitive issues/brain fog but it doesn't really help with fatigue (high dose magnesium did a lot more for my fatigue than moda). I'm on 300mg and I think there is a tendency for tolerance so maybe take it and when it starts to fade, cut back to a pill every other day for awhile and then go back to every day etc. It just needs boosts every so often. Better to be on it than not but the effect is minimal sadly for me",L
8,Modafinil,Chronic Fatigue Syndrome,2.0,,"November 27, 2020",20,"I was first given this medication modafinil in October when I volunteered to go to an in-patient facility for my depression. They put it on me for my chronic fatigue (that they later told me was from CFS). At first, it gave my body energy but still left my mind in a fog of tiredness. It also increased my heart rate and gave me anxiety like none I had every seen. That lasted for 2 or 3 days. When I was finally released, my insurance required prior authorization in order to fill the prescription. Of course it took my the collective amount of doctors from both my primary and the in-patient nearly 3 weeks to finally get the prescription filled. When I finally got back on it, I felt a little energized (of course I was on bed rest at the time for a foot injury, go figure). But that quickly wore off. I have been on it almost a month now and am pretty much back to where I was energy level wise. I was so hopeful too..",EverlastingFatigue

My life is now in turmoil because of my addiction to this medication. As I write I’m searching the internet to find a supplier. I’m terrified of running out in 3 days. There is an underground consensus on the physical and psychological withdrawals. The best I can do is share my experience with others to hopefully avoid terrible heartache in your life, I’ve already messed mine up.

13,Modafinil,Chronic Fatigue Syndrome,6.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"July 7, 2019",40,I started using it about a year ago for excessive fatigue from multiple sclerosis or from the MS drug I'd changed to a year back.   At first I started with 50 mg modafinil.   At that time I had to go to a neurological appointment.   I had multiple panic attacks while going to the appointment.  I even took Xanax which didn't even help.  It's like the modafinil over road the Xanax effects.  Modafinil didn't wear off for hours.   I'd already struggled with anxiety from neuro issues so this was so frustrating for me.Since then I'll take 25 mg occasionally.Make sure you start low and also take very early or you'll have insomnia.  This drug has a very long half life.Wish it helped me more but the side effects for me aren't great.,Chris
14,Modafinil,Chronic Fatigue Syndrome,6.0,,"June 14, 2019",45,"My experience with Modafinil was tough. I have been struggling with daily fatigue for a while now and my psychiatrist prescribed me it to help me wake up. It has in fact helped me with that, and I feel like I can mostly go through each day without crashing or feeling like a dead fish. However, I have a severe anxiety disorder and my psychiatrist had been cautious of prescribing me a stimulant in case it increased said anxiety. Unfortunately, that’s what Modafinil did to me. It increased my heart rate and gave me overall physical anxiety, which seems impossible to get rid of once it attacks me. This in turn causes mental anxiety. The energy Modafinil gave me ultimately was not worth this anxious increase. Also, since the drug is a controlled substance I couldn’t get a refill anyway, and it just wasn’t worth it. I would say that each person is different and while anxiety is a common side effect it doesn’t have to be a sole feature. It did give me energy and that was a big plus.",CKLC
15,Modafinil,Chronic Fatigue Syndrome,5.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"May 16, 2019",29,"Was prescribed armodafinil 150mg for chronic fatigue syndrome, at first I started off splitting it in half, which made me alert initially, but stopped being effective in a few days. I then tried taking the entire 150mg, which didn't make me alert, but gave me headaches, nausea, and made me very thirsty. Have been taking modafinil 100mg now for a couple of months, to varying degrees of success. I split the pills, take a half in mornings. I usually end up getting a headache by the late afternoon. On days where my fatigue is exacerbated, I avoid taking it as it leads to a huge headache for me. When I feel the headaches coming on, I know my productive day is over. I find that trying to power through the headaches leads to feeling terrible the next day, even if I take paracetamol. If modafinil had more of an affect on my fatigue, I could forgive the headaches and the price. But unfortunately it hasn't done much for me.",Anonymous
16,Modafinil,Chronic Fatigue Syndrome,4.0,,"May 1, 2019",52,"Modofinil is an interesting drug. I have fibromyalgia and fatigue problems. Within the first 3-4 days of taking 100mg, I noticed a marginal difference. It was odd, like I had more physical energy and could pay attention without feeling buzzed. However, it did feel very artificial and sometimes like my brain was fighting it. After about a week of taking it, I noticed I was feeling very tired- almost like a train had hit me during the day. I first associated it with sleep issues or not recently taken my Testosterone (I take this to help with workouts and fight libido problems that comes with Fibro), but I eventually realized that the zombied out feeling was actually caused by the Modofinil. It made retaining information and memory recall more difficult. From what I've read this is called a case of the ""stoopids""Its typically a pretty rare side effect and it seems to be pretty successful for many people, but the feeling was just way too uncomfortable for me.",RoscoeTheDog

18,Modafinil,Chronic Fatigue Syndrome,8.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"December 17, 2018",57,"I'm a chronic procrastinator and I've had problems with sticking to my heavy workload as a self-employed person. I'd start but I wouldn't get much done. I also suffer from depression.Modafinil (Modalert) helps. I can now actually get work done, even 100 mg is enough, and I've also found my mood is much more stable during the day. A bad event won't get to me.There's no way to reduce the effect. Even if you take calming substances, such as marijuana, both will have effect at the same time and that's not a very good thing. To get the best effect out of modafinil, you need to be well rested, well fed, hydrated and generally healthy and positive.I tend to be a bit more precise in communication (and I perhaps annoyingly demand the same from others), but this is not a drug that improves cognitive abilities. It just makes me stick to what I wanted to do - which is a huge positive effect that can change one's life for the better. It's a drug against lazyness / procrastination.",Sillyme123

22,Modafinil,Chronic Fatigue Syndrome,5.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"April 4, 2017",15,"I have another comment because this drug is so expensive.  My insurance required preauthorization, but after a week, they allowed it and it cost me only $8/month.  If it was not allowed by insurance I couldn't have afforded it because it is about $100 from the local compounding pharmacy that also seeks bargains for their customers.  That's too much for me.  This drug has been around for a long time, there's no sense it delaying medical care like this.    So how about that?  Automatic preauthorization should be just as dangerous and just as denounced.  For CFS this drug can be life or death for people.  I wish it wasn't an allergy for me though. :(",HanselGretel

When I started taking the meds 200 mg 1 1/2 tabs twice a day. The insurance approved. As the cost of the meds increased the denials started coming. I had to change insurance company due to my work. They would only approve two tablets a day therefore I had to adjusted to only taking two tablets a day.

26,Modafinil,Chronic Fatigue Syndrome,,,"July 15, 2016",39,"I was prescribed Provigil 200mg BID in 2005 for my Chronic, severe fatigue due to MS and multiple flare ups from fibromyalgia.It is the best drug for me. I get a good 4 1/2 hours with the AM dose. And the same with the PM dose.  It allowed me to maintain my full time job until my retirement.  The prob is I'm on Medicare and pay $800 /mo for highmark PPO blue, just for the drug coverage. Then, my pharmacy will only give me 15 days at a time at a $120.00 co pay. So, now we have a drug that helps me function normally, but the poor house is just around the corner for me.  Why make such a successful drug, offer it to middle class people, give them the hope they were seeking and then at some point have to stop because really, who can afford it???
