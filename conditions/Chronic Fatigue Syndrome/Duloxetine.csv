I have tried many drug which  I stopped due to many side effects.  Always consult doctor before taking duloxetine, now I am energetic without anxiety, I always want to some work and my brain clearer. Right now I am on 60mg a day.",Rahul
1,Duloxetine,Chronic Fatigue Syndrome,9,Taken for less than 1 month,"August 7, 2012",22,"Cymbalta (duloxetine):Bad nausea on the first day, about one hour after taking it (60mg) but that has eased off completely. First two nights I didn't sleep at all but that has also settled down quickly for me.  So far the side effects are minimal for me, compared with horrors of Prozac, Zoloft and Cipramil, which I could not tolerate at all.",Sambrightstar
2,Duloxetine,Chronic Fatigue Syndrome,5,,"January 5, 2011",7,Cymbalta (duloxetine):I have only taken one 30 mg pill and the nausea is horrible. I'm not sure about continuing with it.,Anonymous
3,Duloxetine,Chronic Fatigue Syndrome,1,,"November 17, 2009",31,"Cymbalta (duloxetine):I stayed nauseated the whole time I took it. Plus I lost all sense of judgement and reason. I started buying stuff on Ebay with a charge card. I had charged about $21,000. of stuff without concern. Thank goodness my husband figured it out and stopped me before I maxed it out at $25,000. As he was calling canceling it, I was right in the middle of another purchase. I am back on Prozac and back to normal. I have an aunt that told me that it made her lose all inhibitions about spending also. So user beware!",ishe2she
4,Duloxetine,Chronic Fatigue Syndrome,1,,"October 7, 2009",11,"Cymbalta (duloxetine):This medication made me nauseous for 12  hours a day about 30 minutes after I took it.  My doctor changed me to Wellbutrin, but I am weary to try it.",jsherknus
5,Duloxetine,Chronic Fatigue Syndrome,8,,"June 11, 2009",45,"Cymbalta (duloxetine):I have been experiencing chronic fatigue (inability to muster up energy for anything) for as long as I can recall.  My doctor gave me a trial for Cymbalta for approximately two months and I noticed an improvement.  My mom had a stroke and I was away for a few weeks and unfortunately I ran out of my medication, so I thought I would be okay without it.  I was wrong!  I experienced major withdrawals after about two weeks.  I was easily agitated.  I did not leave my apartment.  I could not sleep.  Some nights I was up until 4:00AM.  Earlier in the week I went back on it and things seem to be slowly getting back on track. ",ki_koreen
