0,Lisdexamfetamine,Chronic Fatigue Syndrome,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"March 8, 2022",0,lisdexamfetamine was a game changer for me after 8 years of dealing with Chronic Fatigue Syndrome CFS due to a relapse of a mononucleosis infection. I have been taking Ritalin before this drug which wasn't bad but not very great either. The difference between lisdexamphetamine and Ritalin is day and night for me. I can finally get a good night sleep at nights even after a hard day of work. It boosted my energy and concentration like nothing else would with almost no side effects. I take 30 mg daily and the only thing that worries me is that there comes a day when I wouldn't have access to it. I also take Doxepin 25mg and Clonazepam 1mg before bed to improve my sleep quality and Paroxetine 20mg to manage my depression and anxiety.,Duck
1,Lisdexamfetamine,Chronic Fatigue Syndrome,10.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"October 2, 2020",25,Having Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (CFS) for 4 years completely destroyed my life. Spent 15k trying to recover finally decided to go to a psychiatrist and ask for Vyvanse (I found this through my own research) Well its like night and day. I can function like a normal person. I do have 5mg of instant release dexedrine in the afternoon as a booster. I also have 2 or 3 days off each week so I avoid tolerance. This has absolutely saved my life I wish I could take it everyday..If you're suffering get a psychiatrist and give it a go,Charlotte
2,Lisdexamfetamine,Chronic Fatigue Syndrome,9.0,Taken for 5 to 10 years,"September 5, 2020",50,"I have ADHD, fibromyalgia, chronic fatigue syndrome, and narcolepsy. Vyvanse is a lifesaver. It is the only medication that improves my quality of life. Not only does it help my concentration, it also helps with the pain. I hope that Shire starts making doses higher than 70mg, as it does cause tolerance to increase. The only way around that is to take a day or two off the medication every week. My doctor prescribes me 10mg instant release dexamphetamine tablets to take on those days so I don’t suffer such a hard crash.All in all, it is a consistent medication with few side effects. Yes, it can be abused by people who do not have any medical reasons for taking it. But for those of us that do have medical conditions, it vastly improves quality of life. I am very tired of the demonization of amphetamines, and people equating this to crystal meth. Under the care of a doctor, there is little chance that someone will abuse or become addicted to this drug.",Louis Cyphre
3,Lisdexamfetamine,Chronic Fatigue Syndrome,8.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"August 27, 2020",16,"I was diagnosed with CFS/ME 5 years ago. Although I learned how to manage it better through pacing, I still felt very limited in what I could do in one day. Nine months ago, I started on Vyvanse - 10mg for 2 weeks, 20 mg for two weeks and then settled in with a dose of 30mg daily. It did give me more energy but I had to be careful to still pace myself and not over do it. I felt more motivated and more positive. It also helped with general pain. I did not like the side effects of dry mouth and I felt almost like a clenching of my muscles so my doctor reduced me to 20mg two weeks ago. My fatigue and pain are back and worse than before. I’m feeling discouraged and will likely go back to the 30mg. It’s worth the side effects to have more energy and to feel positive and creative.",Alice
4,Lisdexamfetamine,Chronic Fatigue Syndrome,3.0,,"September 18, 2019",28,"Used Adderall XR a few years and wasn't helping with physical/mental energy, unmotivated & unfocused, even lost my job. Doc switched me to Vyvance 10 or 20mg and took even longer to work. I know reviews here are positive, but I didn't get benefits with Vyvance and went back. Barely noticed any change like taking nothing at all. Maybe doc gave too low dose? Now trying Armodafinil 250mg. Doc said break 1/2 and did 1st week+ and didn't help much. Then 3/4 sometimes full 250. Not great. I'm frustrated I can't find anything to help with mental/physical energy. I was vivacious, hard working, driven til mid 40s. I'm sure it's partially hormonal but I'm a drained person. Can't think, tired all the time, disorganized, foggy, unmotivated. Adderall helped me get out of bed but no physical energy or mental focus. Everything tried, I move around like a saggy robot without passion. Projects undone, papers piled up. I don't know what to try anymore. Looking online for other possible treatments.",PC
5,Lisdexamfetamine,Chronic Fatigue Syndrome,10.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"September 6, 2019",16,"My 6 year old son has struggled with severe anxiety, sensory processing, and ADHD nearly his entire life. This is the 5th or 6th medication we have tried after having terrible results with the others. He is truly a different child on this medication. His impulsiveness has decreased tremendously, his anxiety is almost nonexistent, his outbursts, rages, and tantrums are nearly gone. And the best part is, that we can actually see his true personality for the first time EVER. Hallelujah! His symptoms are so controlled now that he can express himself, be creative, problem-solve, and do well in school. I am so grateful for his pediatrician for recommending this. It has changed the lives of our entire family.",Cindy
6,Lisdexamfetamine,Chronic Fatigue Syndrome,10.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"December 12, 2018",38,"My life has absolutely changed. I've been bed ridden for years. I missed a day and a half at a very important client meeting because I couldn't move to get out of bed. Vyvanse 40 mg. has given me my life back. I can't begin to express my gratitude. Because some doctors are unaware of this study however, the doctor that took over for my current practitioner wouldn't refill my RX. I only have a few days left and am terrified to go back to my old way of life, or lack there of. I would highly recommend Vyvanse for Chronic Fatigue and Fibromyalgia. I feel so much better!",TAR
7,Lisdexamfetamine,Chronic Fatigue Syndrome,10.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"April 19, 2018",27,"I can’t even begin to tell you how much better I’m feeling. I’d gone on a business trip to see a multi billion dollar corporation for 3 days. After a day and a half I had to tell them I was so ill that I needed to leave. By the next day, I couldn’t move to get out of bed. I’d never felt that bad before. That’s when I decided I had enough of feeling exhausted, tired and foggy all the time. I researched CFS medications and found this forum along with double blind studies. I started on 30 mg. Initially I felt shaky and my heart was pounding. I found that if I ate with the Vyvanse  that didn't happen.  I felt great and had energy all day long. I also have fibromyalgia and ehlers-Danlos and it’s helped my pain tremendously. I sleep great band cause of all the energy I burn. I haven’t lost any weight or my appetite. I am so grateful for this medication. 10 Stars!",TR in Cali
8,Lisdexamfetamine,Chronic Fatigue Syndrome,9.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"August 28, 2017",46,"I was utterly shattered and didn't know what to do before I started this drug. I had bone crushing chronic fatigue and felt I had tried everything. I was so tired for so long I was planning on ending my life. I am on 50mg and it has made a huge difference. I have very little fatigue now, I still have some problems with anxiety an depression but I always had those. Overall I am much better on the drug. I had tried other stimulants like Concerta, Ritalin and Provigil before with little effect. If you are suffering from chronic fatigue please give lisdexamphetamine a try as it can make a big difference.",nenagh1982
9,Lisdexamfetamine,Chronic Fatigue Syndrome,10.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"October 15, 2016",53,"This medicine is a truly life saver. Even with my depression well treated, i kept physicaly tired the whole day. I wanted to do things but my body felt like i spent 3 hours at the gym. 30mg of it, 6am changed the whole game. I can go on really motivated the whole day and still get a great night of sleep.NO SIDE EFFECTS besides some stomach cramps on the first days There's no comparsion with other meds i've tried before (provigil and Focalin)I can finally say that i'm capable of doing anything if i truly want to.",Anonymous
10,Lisdexamfetamine,Chronic Fatigue Syndrome,10.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"May 6, 2016",39,"This drug changed my life- I would have to take 4 hour naps during the day, on top of 8-10 hours of sleep in order to get through aa day but now I can stay awake and it helps me FOCUS. Upon taking it I feel an overwhelming sense of positivity almost a ""high"" and it lasts for hours. I can accomplish anything I want to. The drug lasts for the whole work day and I'm back to being my sleepy self by night time. I take 60mg and weigh 145. I would definitely recommend this drug.",Laurenapolis
11,Lisdexamfetamine,Chronic Fatigue Syndrome,,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"March 8, 2016",9,I suffered a traumatic brain injury in 2003 at the age of 17. Comatose for 28 days and about one year ago I finally got someone to listen and give me something vyvanse helped a ton at first with my waves of fatigue. My daughter was recently diagnosed ADHD and she also takes vyvanse worked great in the beginning but both of us it seems to have just stopped? Focus an concentration are worse than before meds. And when it does kick in it maybe lasts 6 hours. Also believe I am suffering from post traumatic narcolepsy. Wish this med worked as well now as in the beginning. I was upped to 50 mg recently she  complained it wasn't helping but making me feel worse and all that did was make me grind my teeth even more and worsen my insomnia,absent minded mommy
12,Lisdexamfetamine,Chronic Fatigue Syndrome,9.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"October 14, 2014",42,"I finally got diagnosed with Lupus two years ago after going to many doctors that couldn't find anything wrong with me. I knew that my extreme chronic fatigue wasn't normal. After 5 years of different doctors one did an ANA test and my Lupus was 1:674 which is very high. I started the vyvanse 20 for a month and didn't help then went to 40 for about a year now  on 50mg. I take it at 7 am and I can feel it kick in about 9:30. It keeps me awake and able to do what needs to be done. Some days I feel the vyvanse work better than others. If I eat a high protein breakfast it always does better. No OJ or acid drinks or fruit. It makes the vyvanse not work well. It's expensive if u don't have insurance, try Adderral 20 instant its the same & cheaper",Finally something works
13,Lisdexamfetamine,Chronic Fatigue Syndrome,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"December 27, 2013",71,I have been living with chronic fatigue for over 9 years now. I have gone to so many different doctors and have been put on so many different kinds of medicines that never worked. I finally was put on Vyvanse 30 mg. I can not tell you how much this Medicean has changed my life for the better. I would have to force myself out of bed in the mornings and come back home after taking the kids to school and tell myself I would just rest for 20 mins and then get up. I would fall back to sleep for hours and could not figure out what was wrong with me. I hated feeling so tired all the time. I've been on vyvanse now for 1 week and it is a miracle drug for me. I have energy and my life back. I only wish I would have known about this 9 years ago.,Love1another

The ONLY thing that has allowed me to feel 'normal"" enough to participate in my own life again is Vyvanse. Unfortunately, I have recently moved from AZ to CA and due to different laws, I have been unable to fill or receive a new prescription in CA (even with all of my doctors records and recommendations) and I have been severely depressed due to all the old symptoms returning. BUT VYVANSE SAVED MY LIFE AND I HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT.",Anonymous

Vyvanse is a wonderful medication for chronic daytime sleepiness and fatigue. I could not believe the amount of work I was able to get done. It does not make you feel ""drugged"" like other medications do. I felt like my old self again, before the days of CFS.",purplebutterfly1964
