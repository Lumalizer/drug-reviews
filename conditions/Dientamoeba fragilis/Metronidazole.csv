2,Metronidazole,Dientamoeba fragilis,2.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"October 2, 2018",2,"My wife and I took this medication for D fragilis.  Our only side effect was an odd taste in the mouth.  The medication was not effective.  It only alleviated our symptoms for a month or two, and didn't get rid of the D fragilis.  Taking this medication basically set us back a year in trying to get rid of this protozoan.",KC
3,Metronidazole,Dientamoeba fragilis,,,"February 8, 2018",2,"I’ve been prescribed with the this medication for dientamoeba fragilis (which has destroyed my life and body). I am on day 5 and at a loss of words on how horrible I feel. I feel dizzy all the time, my stomach hurts and it feels as if something is burning my insides. I’ve lost all appetite completely and feel very nauseous and disoriented. I am fit female and work out 6 days of the week so I drink over 3 litres of water per day regardless my urine has turned almost dark orange. I am on a strict diet so I do take it with food as directed 500mg dosage 3 times a day and feel like I will puke most of the day. I hope it cures my issue as I will never take this medication again. By the way, for those that are unaware, when this med was tested on animals it has been shown that it can cause cancer but the side effects on humans are unknown  I wonder who approves these meds to go out on the counter. Good luck to everyone!",DesperateForCure
