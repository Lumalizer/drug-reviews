0,Risperidone,Severe Mood Dysregulation,10,,"January 24, 2021",2,"Before risperidone, maintaining focus for longer than 15-20 minutes exhausted me.  I could not ""tune out"" external stimuli (sights, sounds, smells); everything seemed to stir up an emotion and/or cause cumulative, cascading thoughts. This caused anxiety and depression that lasted weeks.  After a 9 consecutive days of risperidone (0.5mg/day), I am alert, confident, and my anxiety has all but vanished.  I still experience some racing / intrusive thoughts, but they're softer and easier to quiet.  I'm curious to see if 1mg/day will stifle them completely.  I wish I would've found this psychiatrist and this medication 20 years ago instead of having to endure several misdiagnosis and Rx roller coaster rides. This drug saved my life.As I mentioned, I have not been on it very long, so it may be too early to notice any side effects; however, my appetite has always been small and I still need to take 5mg of melatonin before bedtime in order to fall sleep. 48yr old male, 6'2"", and 217lbs.",ToasterStrudel
1,Risperidone,Severe Mood Dysregulation,7,,"June 13, 2018",6,"We used Risperidone for our son since he was 5 years old.  It was a real change.  He used to have meltdowns which lasted 1 hour or more almost every day, some days 2-3 per day. We were exhausted. We started with 2, 3 drops, he overdosed because he was so sensitive, we had to stop and start again slowly, but once we did that, it was a completely different kid.  The dosage had to be increased every 2 weeks and with time the doctor didn't want to increase the dosage anymore.  He stopped the medicine with 10 drops in the morning and 10 drops at night, weighing less than 23 kg.  He is skinny, never gain weight, because of his hyperactivity.  The risperidal never helped with ADHD, just with the aggressiveness and meltdowns.  If it weren't because of  how quickly the  body was getting used to the drug, it is a good drug for him.  We had to change for another medication, but it was not so effective as risperidone.  He had more meltdowns, throwing things and hitting us everyday like before.",GG
2,Risperidone,Severe Mood Dysregulation,1,Taken for less than 1 month,"February 10, 2018",7,"Absolute garbage for my Depersonalization-derealization disorder (PDR) and OCD. I can't see why anyone would want to take this ""med"" other than to control Bipolar Disorder, Schizophrenia or Severe autism. This drug will wipe your humanity away and leave you emotionless. You will forget what it feels like to be human. I now have Hyperprolactinemia 8 months after taking this poison for 12 days at 0.5mg once a day. I don't know about the existence of an alleged ""chemical imabalance"" that causes our ""disorders"" but I can definitely tell you that I have one now caused by the drug. I also have gynecomastia, I will now have to leave my country to undergo surgery to remove it. At a cost of â‚¬3000??? That's if my prolactin even goes down in the first place.To Janssen, a bunch of morons who are best known to make men grow boobs. I hope you take pride in your work. It's your legacy.",What a load of
3,Risperidone,Severe Mood Dysregulation,8,,"April 8, 2012",37,"First off, this medication made me lactate and not be able to lose weight, which was disturbing and frustrating. However, it really helped me sleep. It definitely mellowed me out and made me less anxious and irritable. I stopped it because I started to lose interest in life, but it may have been because 3 mg was too much for me; I believe this is a good medicine for psychosis and mood disorders.",Anonymous
