0,Voriconazole,Candidemia,9,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"April 5, 2018",2,Vfend (voriconazole):I were prescribed Pfizer VFend by my Dr for a period of 60 days.  I was told that there is no generic available for VFend. Medical Aid only paid for 30 day treatment. Medicine is excellent  but totally too expensive at a cost of R34 000 (rand) per month.,Mariaan
