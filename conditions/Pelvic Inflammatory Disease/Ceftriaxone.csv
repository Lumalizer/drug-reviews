0,Ceftriaxone,Pelvic Inflammatory Disease,1,Taken for less than 1 month,"January 13, 2022",0,"I’m so glad everyone else has had a good experience with this medicine. Me on the other hand, I received a shot on Tuesday which gave me severe lower back pain. I received a second shot on Wednesday which resulted in the same intense lower back pain. It is now Thursday morning and my face is swollen, red and burning intensely. I’ve taken Benadryl but nothing is helping.",Yikes
1,Ceftriaxone,Pelvic Inflammatory Disease,3,Taken for less than 1 month,"December 30, 2016",4,"I was given an injection of ceftriaxone two days ago for pelvic inflammatory disease. A few hours after I received the injection, I suddenly felt lightheaded and dizzy and needed to lay down. When I woke up, I had terrible diarrhea. I ended up spending the entire night violently ill, getting intense hot flashes before vomiting, and then getting so cold that I was shivering uncontrollably. I vomited 6 times, and my body (especially my legs) is still in so much pain. My green discharge seems to have improved, but my pelvic pain is actually much worse now, because of how much pain I'm in after vomiting and shivering. My boyfriend and I had the same food and he was not sick, and a nurse told me this is a rare reaction to this injection.",Anonymous
