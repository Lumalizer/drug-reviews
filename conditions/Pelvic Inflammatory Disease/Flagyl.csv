0,Flagyl,Pelvic Inflammatory Disease,3,,"August 31, 2019",7,"For the first couple days, every time I took this I was overcome with a severe migraine. After a few days, the migraines stopped, but what came next was far worse: insomnia, fever, fainting, no appetite, severe exhaustion, dizziness & brain fog/decreased motor skills. Due to the medicine’s side effects, I was convinced my uterine infection was killing me, going septic. I couldn’t tell if I was sick from the infection, or from the antibiotics - neither could the doctor. Hours after my final dose, I collapsed, BP dropped, fever & shakes set in. I spent the next 3 days in bed, unable to eat, constant diarrhea, heart palps, vertigo, too nauseated to speak, unable to do anything but sleep. It has now been 4 days since I’ve been off the medication. I am still dizzy & quite weak, but I feel a little more normal. I hope the uterine infection has been properly managed. Time will tell if the side effects were worth it.",Patricia
1,Flagyl,Pelvic Inflammatory Disease,6,,"January 3, 2018",2,"So I started this medication 2 1/5 days ago, and let me tell ya... first day was ok, also I'm taking it with Bentyl for IBS and stomach spasms. Now day 2 was weird for me I had this feeling like I had been drinking all night or doing drugs. I couldn't get warm I felt super high, slurred speech, kept repeating to my boyfriend that ""this medicine makes me feel like I'm dying."" I had to take a Xanax just to fall asleep. Day 3 and I've taken my first pill of the day.. I can eat regularly my vision is clearer... idk I still have 4 days left so we'll see.",TropixBartender
