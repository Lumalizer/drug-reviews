0,Metronidazole,Pelvic Inflammatory Disease,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"February 3, 2022",0,"Prescribed 14 days worth of metronidazole alongside Ofloxacin for suspected PID (non STI related, previously had BV so potentially developed again and caused PID). Within days I was feeling much more dizzy, weak, tired, taking the meds caused me to not sleep, waking after a couple of hours and being wide awake mind racing. Also heavy night sweats every night and mind fog/confusion daily. I tested one night not taking my second dose and all symptoms stopped and I slept through. Gp told me I must continue to take if I can as any alt meds would have the same symptoms. I've taken time off work as I can't function at all on these. After an ultrasound scan and hopefully finishing the meds really hoping I feel better but currently feeling absolutely awful. When I told the surgery a pharmacist called me back and said this combo always make you feel worse before you feel better and another gp said my symptoms were out of the ordinary. After reading here it sounds like their not!",Deenascribbles
1,Metronidazole,Pelvic Inflammatory Disease,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"August 14, 2021",0,"I’m current taking x 2 400g Metronidazole daily alongside 2 x 400g Ofloxacin for suspected  PID. The side effects are horrific. I started getting lower back pain near my right hip straight away, my knee joints hurt too. I can barely walk. The nausea and diarrhoea are so bad that I can’t eat. I feel like I have food poisoning. I also feel dizzy, like I’m hungover & drunk at the same time. I have tingling and electric shock feelings in my face and arms. I’m also extremely anxious and paranoid. I haven’t felt this bad ever before & I haven’t been able to leave the house for days. I’m on day 8 of a 14 day course. I understand the long term complications of PID so I’m scared to stop the course of antibiotics but I'm also scared incase I have long lasting side effects due to the antibiotics. I can’t sleep either. I feel like I’ve lost my mind.",Claire

3,Metronidazole,Pelvic Inflammatory Disease,4.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"April 19, 2021",0,"What I know about P.I.D is that, there is a test you need to do before taking any drug for infection and this test is known as HVS M/C/S AND URINE M/C/S. This is the test that will tell you the type of infection you are having and the drug that will clear the infection. And about drug combination, there are some drug that can't be combine together always mind how you combine drugs.Thanks",Marybee
4,Metronidazole,Pelvic Inflammatory Disease,2.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"February 23, 2021",3,"Took this drug for PID along with doxycycline. And let me tell you, it was the WORST time of my life. I took this medicine before and I had no problems but this time, it was so bad. I had severe nerve pain throughout all of my body, mostly my feet. I cried all through the night. I could not sleep. The nerve pain felt like random electrical shocks in your body so you can imagine how painful that is. I had to stop taking them, I told my doctor and she switched me to azithromycin which gave me little to no problems. I think I even had nerve damage because of it. My left toes keep twitching non stop for months. Once again currently, I have an infection due to PID again. My doctor put this on the list and I told her right there to remove it.",Mona
5,Metronidazole,Pelvic Inflammatory Disease,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"February 1, 2021",0,"Be careful if you take with ofloxacin!I was prescribed 400g metronidazole and 400g ofloxacin to take 2x day for 14 days (PID). I’ve taken metronidazole before with no side effects but after 2 days of the combined antibiotics I had to stop. First night I suffered with insomnia & a very dry mouth. The insomnia returned night 2 plus I suffered extreme confusion, nausea, chills, tingling & severe anxiety. I couldn’t remember my name, my partner’s name or address. I couldn’t control my arm which I was jerking against my head. After I came round I then had a panic attack. Something I’ve never experienced before and pray I won’t again. After some research I think I experienced a seizure caused by the drugs. My doctor told me to stop taking them as it’s not worth it so hopefully I’ll feel normal soon. I also have a kidney disease which may have contributed towards the reaction.Came here to say be VERY careful with these antibiotics as the side effects can be severe",K
6,Metronidazole,Pelvic Inflammatory Disease,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"October 19, 2020",11,I cannot believe these metronidazole tablets are allowed to be given to people. I was prescribed metronidazole 500mg x 2 for 14 days for quite a severe pelvic Infection. I noticed the first few days my anxiety increased somewhat and I had headaches but I continued. I woke up fine took the tablet and within an hour I had pain in both my eyes and a heavy pressure around my skull. My vision started to deteriorate rapidly. The room started to spin and I started getting severe pains in both my legs. At this point I had the worst panic attack of my life I was completely confused and acting unlike myself. I started to get severe deja vu and my thoughts had become agitated and strange. I spent the next few hours on the floor sat by the door incase I needed to run outside for help. I felt like I was going to have a seizure. Called for medical help and was told their is no alternative and I either take them and try to handle the side effects or let the infection continue to worsen. Worst experience of my life.,Pam
7,Metronidazole,Pelvic Inflammatory Disease,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"September 6, 2020",1,"I was given these metronidazole tablets by my doctor and was told to take 2 daily for Pelvic Inflammatory Disease.I have had Pelvic Inflammatory Disease (pid) so many times before and it’s a huge problem for me.But this time round when I took metronidazole, I felt absolutely awful, I went very dizzy and I started to feel sick until I was sick, I had a really upset stomach and diarrhea. It also caused me to have massive headaches like pounding out of the blue headaches. So what I have to do now is eat breakfast then take the tablet, I know I’m not meant to but I have been doing that and have been feeling much better. However I’m definitely going to talk to my doctor about these tablets and discuss other options of medication!",Lorrie
8,Metronidazole,Pelvic Inflammatory Disease,3.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"July 24, 2020",10,"I have been diagnosed with suspected PID (Pelvic Inflammatory Disease)so was given this drug metronidazole alongside Ofloxacin. I'm on day 2 of these drugs. I am not sure what's my illness and what's the side effects of these drugs. But looking at others symptoms it seems that what I've been experiencing is likely the side effects. I've had really awful nausea, stomach pains, soft stools, insomnia, metallic taste, frequently peeing, hot flushes and hot cheeks  (but no real temperature) sweating. I hope as my course progresses these symptoms will ease but seemingly others haven't been so lucky so I probably won't feel much better. At this rate - so long as it clears up my infection I'll put up with it.",Naplvani
9,Metronidazole,Pelvic Inflammatory Disease,3.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"April 4, 2020",4,"I've been on Flagyl before for a tubo ovarian abscess and only experienced nausea. Recently, I got PID again (non STD related) so I started a course of 500mg twice daily (given the current pandemic my doctor didn't have access to an ultrasound to check for growth of a new one and I'm planning to put off the hospital unless absolutely needed.)It is now the fourth day of my course and I stopped taking them due to joint pain and tingling sensations in my hands and feet. My doctor told me it could be causing problems with my nerves and she didn't want to risk me continuing the course.Other symptoms included a persistent headache, eye pain, diarrhea, nausea. I'm still experiencing tingling as I type this but I believe it will go away since I caught it early. Hopefully I never have to go on this medication again.I'm giving it a rating of 3 solely because it worked the first time around.",Jiji

I am on my day 4 and I have to say , I don’t know how I will do 14 days. I am feeling really sick, insomnia has hit me hard , exhaustion, metal taste, cold sweats.

11,Metronidazole,Pelvic Inflammatory Disease,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"February 14, 2020",9,"Went to the ER because of intense pelvic pain and ended up having PID (pelvic inflammatory disease) from BV, a kidney infection and a 7cm cyst on my ovary. I was prescribed flagyl dose 500mg 3x a day and doxy 100mg 2x a day. I have felt like these were actually harming me so much. Constant fatigue, awful taste in my mouth. If I didn’t eat with it, I would throw up. The NAUSEA was constant. The thought of food even made me nauseous. I was constantly anxious and worrying and also had a constant headache. Fixed the problem, but definitely the worst two weeks of my life.",Ouch
12,Metronidazole,Pelvic Inflammatory Disease,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"January 7, 2020",3,"As a medical student I am very aware how medications affect people differently so take reviews with a pinch of salt. However, I hold this drug responsible as the trigger for me developing panic disorder, within 4 hours of the first dosage I experienced my first ever panic attack. I did not blame the drug at first so kept on taking them to plan, the attacks got continuously more intense and frequent. Upon coming off the drug it took me 3 months of therapy and anti-depressants to control the panic disorder. I would highly not recommend this medication for any at risk individuals, or anyone unless they absolutely need to take it.",Ally
13,Metronidazole,Pelvic Inflammatory Disease,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"September 14, 2019",1,"I took metronidazole alongside Ofloxacin and I was on them for less than two days when I started vomiting and getting such bad cramps, I stopped taking them to be told by the dr that it wasn’t that I was allergic to them and I could have them again in the future if needed. No thanks I’ll stay well clear.",Josamy
14,Metronidazole,Pelvic Inflammatory Disease,3.0,,"August 31, 2019",7,"Flagyl (metronidazole):For the first couple days, every time I took this I was overcome with a severe migraine. After a few days, the migraines stopped, but what came next was far worse: insomnia, fever, fainting, no appetite, severe exhaustion, dizziness & brain fog/decreased motor skills. Due to the medicine’s side effects, I was convinced my uterine infection was killing me, going septic. I couldn’t tell if I was sick from the infection, or from the antibiotics - neither could the doctor. Hours after my final dose, I collapsed, BP dropped, fever & shakes set in. I spent the next 3 days in bed, unable to eat, constant diarrhea, heart palps, vertigo, too nauseated to speak, unable to do anything but sleep. It has now been 4 days since I’ve been off the medication. I am still dizzy & quite weak, but I feel a little more normal. I hope the uterine infection has been properly managed. Time will tell if the side effects were worth it.",Patricia

16,Metronidazole,Pelvic Inflammatory Disease,1.0,,"August 5, 2019",1,"I was prescribe this medicine for 5 days. On the fourth day it was not possible to finish the course. I had an intense tension headache along with paranoia. On top of this I was talking doxycyline (which is a hard work in itself). While my doctor explained that this course was the only way to treat the PID I was certainly not prepared for the side effects. On this medication I ate well, did not vomit (even though nausea was experienced), I don't drink alcohol, took probiotics, and did not consume any dairy; but the side effects still got me pretty bad. I urge anyone who is about to take this medication to educate themselves on the side effects. If this medication has you down I hope you'll be alright. Stay strong and watch a comedy. I am now stuck with tension and an inflamed colon but I am going to treat this all the naturally.",Goku

I think It works for the cause but side effects are a lot that make me feel like I'm dying.  I'm nauseous every single min. Doc prescribed me with Metrogyl 400mg thrice for 14 days along with doxycycline 100MG twice daily.

I had just about every side effect you can imagine: bad taste in mouth, nausea, lack of appetite, headache, debilitating fatigue, body aches, and I felt like I had a fever but my temperature was never high.

I'm 19 and this is my 4th time being given them for pelvic inflammatory disease, however they haven't improved my symptoms what so ever I think they are the worst antibiotics you can get.

Put fluid(water) in your mouth first as if your about to gargle and tilt your head back and push the pill through your lips and it will float towards your throat so just swallow and your done. My mistake was taking it with lemonade. It seemed as if there was an irruption of the pill in my mouth.
