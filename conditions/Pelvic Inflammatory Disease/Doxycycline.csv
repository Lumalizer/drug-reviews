0,Doxycycline,Pelvic Inflammatory Disease,,Taken for less than 1 month,"November 30, 2021",2,"Taken my first few tablets and from someone who has bad anxiety- the stress I felt before taking these tablets wasn’t worth it, don’t let the reviews scare you. A few hours after taking it I felt sick and had a bit of a headache, but that was gone after a few sips of water. Later on, I was throwing up but it was foamy and watery because I hadn’t eaten much due to no appetite. Other than the odd heart palpitation I feel fine. I had PID and I’ve been prescribed  two different kinds of antibiotics but haven’t started the second lot due to all the bad reviews and I’m going to find a different way, but if you want to get better then please start the tablets. My biggest fear is getting sepsis or some kind of blood infection if it spreads but I know the chances of that are very low due to the fact I’m a healthy 18 year old. Take the tablets about 10 minutes after eating and make sure your sat up, have some water next to you and get some fresh air, hope ur ok",Anonymous
1,Doxycycline,Pelvic Inflammatory Disease,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"November 4, 2020",2,"I took this doxycycline for PID. Always, always, always take this antibiotic after or while eating a meal. If you don’t, you’ll become very nauseous/possibly vomit. I felt very sick the entire time I took it. I barely had an appetite but I had to force myself to eat so I wouldn’t vomit from the medication. This antibiotic also affected my awareness. I felt like I was high the whole time I took it. Everything felt fuzzy, I had a poor memory.",V
2,Doxycycline,Pelvic Inflammatory Disease,7.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"June 8, 2020",13,"I started taking this doxycycline a 4 days ago after my PID didn't go away from a less strong antibiotic. I was prescribed a 100mg pill, 2 times a day for 7 days. Within minutes after taking this pill I get very dizzy, my eyes become extremely sensitive to light, my stomach starts turning, and I get heartburn every now and then.I don't feel the pain from the PID much anymore (not sure if its because now I'm just focusing on the issues from the pills haha). I'm hoping my PID will be gone after this week and if so - all these side effects will be worth it but it is quite shocking! I've never been so affected by a medication before which makes me feel uneasy about taking this.",mahons
3,Doxycycline,Pelvic Inflammatory Disease,2.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"March 31, 2020",5,"Developed a pelvic infection after having an IUD inserted, prescribed doxy 100mg 2x/day. The first 2 days were fine, extremely minor stomach upset which went away with food. The third day I developed bad diarrhea. The fourth day I took it lying down on an empty stomach right before going to bed...big mistake. Within 30 min I woke out of a dead sleep and was violently sick. Barely made it to the toilet. I am on day 3 of diarrhea. Calling my doctor to see if we can switch meds. Symptoms of my pelvic infection were small fever (around 100) and pelvic pain, neither of which has changed at all since starting this medication.",Tcby
4,Doxycycline,Pelvic Inflammatory Disease,,,"August 21, 2019",20,"Had this antibiotic a few months ago to clear up a chlamydia infection, worked really well! Unfortunately  I have to take it again for pelvic inflammatory disease caused by the chlamydia. So far I’ve had no side effects with this, the only time I had an extremely upset stomach was when I didn’t eat it with food. So please make sure u eat food with it, don’t let the other reviews scare u to take this. It’s really good. And works amazing!",Freya

6,Doxycycline,Pelvic Inflammatory Disease,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"January 24, 2014",38,I've been taking doxycycline for almost two weeks after being diagnosed with pelvic inflammatory disease. It makes you pee excessively and constipates you. But you will start to see the effects take hold within days. I'm now experiencing severe gas. I was nauseous in the beginning but that subsided after a week. Overall its a pain but it works. Don't lay down for an hour after taking it.,gasgal
