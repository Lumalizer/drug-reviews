0,Esomeprazole,GastritisDuodenitis,1,Taken for less than 1 month,"January 3, 2022",0,"I have an anxiety disorder and was prescribed this a few days ago for acid reflux. I feel like my anxiety has gone through the roof, I feel terrible and I'm wondering if it is this drug now that I read all of your comments! I will stop it immediately. I have fast heartbeat, shaking and hand are hot, and a headache. :(",Nikki
1,Esomeprazole,GastritisDuodenitis,4,,"October 5, 2021",0,"I have taken Esomperazole several times but today the side effect was horrible. It triggered psychosis, I took it at 3 am and couldn't sleep anymore, my heart was racing and I felt like chase, accelerated and weird racing abstract thoughts were coming to my mind. Then it triggered an allergic reaction, my body started itching. Never taking it again, too scared of it.",Sally
2,Esomeprazole,GastritisDuodenitis,10,Taken for less than 1 month,"February 24, 2020",3,Was prescribed for acid reflux / indigestion. Originally tried Prilosec and Pepcid complete which made me feel slightly better however not enough. After a day of taking it almost all my symptoms were gone except for a slight tightness in chest from the acid reflux. My suggestion for anybody taking this where their symptoms are pretty severe is to take it once in the morning and then eat breakfast an hour after and during lunch and dinner (Or eating something was red meat or spicy or acidly) I would take a Pepcid complete also (which can be taken twice a day) and then if necessary then taking another esomeprazole at night before bed but in my experience that was never necessary. There is also a 80mg dose if symptoms donâ€™t improve. The only thing worth mentioning is that it can make any other medication your taking last a bit longer because esomeprazole makes it take longer to digest.,Milmil4248
