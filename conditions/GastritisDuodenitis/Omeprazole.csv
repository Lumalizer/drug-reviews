0,Omeprazole,GastritisDuodenitis,9.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"March 8, 2022",1,"I was prescribed omeprazole for ongoing nausea in 2021. After 3 months I was advised to stop it. It had worked brilliantly and I felt so much better. My symptoms re-occurred and I was advised to restart and referred for gastroscopy which I had in Decemberand showed mild gastritis and duodenitis. Biopsies neg for helicobacter, to continue PPI for several months. Reluctant to get ""hooked"" on PPIs I am now ( nearly 3 months later) trying to reduce to alternate days, however the nausea persists on the day without omeprazole and GP suggests take daily and try again ""in a few months"". I have had no adverse effects but am concerned re possible blocking of magnesium absorption as I take this for heart arrythmia..",Bagrat
1,Omeprazole,GastritisDuodenitis,1.0,,"January 18, 2022",2,"Been on this drug for 14 days now, it sure helped with my stomach acid. I felt relief after 3 days, but then I started having anxiety, headaches, diarrhea, brain fog, my eye sight was going out of focus.

2,Omeprazole,GastritisDuodenitis,,Taken for 5 to 10 years,"October 23, 2021",11,I have had stomach problems over the last few years. Initially caused by h pylori I was prescribed antibiotics and 20mg omeprazole after the h pylori was cleared I was recommended to stay on the 20mg of omeprazole for a period of time. 5 years later I am still stuck on this pill the side effects are horrendous I've never felt as tired in all my life I feel very depressed and low. I have severe cramps in my stomach and severe back pain in general I always have a feeling of unwellness I've also been recently diagnosed as having chronic gastritis which I am sure is a side effect from taking omeprazole for so long. However when I stop taking it for a week I feel absolutely amazing  if to describe just normal however it's short lived and my acid reflux and heart burn flare up and I have to go back on the omeprazole. It's a vicious cycle I wish I had never took this drug ever in the first place I am a shadow of my former self.  I would really like to know if anyone is in the same position,Big c
3,Omeprazole,GastritisDuodenitis,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"September 19, 2021",25,"Left my experience already but wanted to post an update. After all the tests and scans, blood work is all good, mild anxiety sometimes still, a few PACS and PVCS (Heartbeat issue)which I believe are caused by Omeprazole induced anxiety. Acupuncture the last month, liver detox herbs, clay bath detox, vitamins d3, K + supplements NAC (N-Ateyl Cysteine), zinc and probiotics are helping me. I’ve researched many a scientific journal + medical research papers regarding the science behind this drug and why the long list of adverse reactions. Long story short, this drug works not only in the stomach as a proton pump, or to stop the pump action to interact with certain enzymes and processes to create acid, but also works in cells throughout the body. It damages processes affecting amino acids such as glutathione which are essential for brain health + neurotransmitters. Do your research but know there is a reason for all of this and we can heal with remedies + time! xo!",Marieski858
4,Omeprazole,GastritisDuodenitis,1.0,,"September 14, 2021",10,"Had chest pains and breathlessness for weeks. Initially thought there was a problem with my heart.  Had blood tests, ultrasound, ECG etc eventually diagnosed with sliding hiatus hernia and gastritis via endoscopy.  Doctor prescribed 20mg omeprazole once per day on the advice of the endoscopist. Big mistake! Omeprazole gave me severe abdominal pain - my entire abdomen was in painful spasms. Needless to say I stopped taking it after 2 days. The next day I was still in pain but by day four it had stopped. Do not take this medication!",Anonymous
5,Omeprazole,GastritisDuodenitis,2.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"September 13, 2021",2,"I was prescribed this drug by an NP to treat gastritis, at 20mg daily for 30 days. I had been diagnosed with gastritis before and was told to take Pepcid daily and I had no issues with that. The NP told me the only side effect I might experience taking omeprazole was diarrhea. In reality, what I experienced was a massive increase in anxiety depression and nightly panic attacks. My resting heart rate has gone up about 20 bpm after taking omeprazole for just 20 days. I am unable to fall asleep until well into the morning so only 3-5 hours per night. I have had anxiety and depression for years, but never as intensely as it is now. I did not consider that the omeprazole was the cause of it! I started a new anxiety medication a little over a month ago and blamed it on my body adjusting to that- after reading these reviews I am almost certain the mood and sleep disturbances I am experiencing are due to taking omeprazole. The acid in my stomach is reduced but that could be my change in diet.",KaR
6,Omeprazole,GastritisDuodenitis,8.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"September 11, 2021",1,"I had the worse gastritis where I could only curl up in a ball and roll. My back was on fire, I was nauseous, and it was horrible. Dr. did a GI test to diagnose. He put meet on our twice a day. I was fine and it definitely helped. No crazy size effects. But, it didn't help right away. What did help with the crazy burning in my stomach (felt like a lit match being put to my stomach from inside) was a mix of coconut oil and peppermint essential oil, mixed correctly obviously, and rubbed all over where my stomach was. Took about a half hour to stop the pain, but I couldn't believe it actually worked! I was desperate for the pain to stop so I tried the essential oil. I didn't want the Karen's to be right lol but this time they were! In the end I and thankful for that and the Omeprazole. Oh, , one more note .. my health insurance charged me more for the Omeprazole than it cost to buy at the pharmacy, can you believe that! So I ended up buying it over the counter the next time I needed it.",Dove
7,Omeprazole,GastritisDuodenitis,1.0,Taken for 10 years or more,"September 11, 2021",1,"I was prescribed omeprazole after being diagnosed with gastritis and over many years I have suffered with palpitations, terrible tightening in my stomach, night sweats with insomnia, aches & pains and nausea. Also had the paramedics out one evening and an overnight stay at the hospital as they thought I was suffering a heart attack.Every time that I have seen the doctor and said these symptoms were worst than the gastritis and not helping at allI have been told to carry on taking them incase the gastritis changed into an ulcer or cancer!! This has left me in a dilemma as I have already had my kidney removed (16 years ago) due to cancer.I have pondered over the years why I have been having these awful symptoms but was always told it was stress & anxiety!Having read these I now realise that it isn't just me that's suffering and it helps a great deal knowing that omeprazole is causing my problems - definitely not curing them.",Deli
8,Omeprazole,GastritisDuodenitis,1.0,,"September 6, 2021",44,"DO. NOT. TAKE. HORRIFIC side effects. Took this for only 5 days due to gastritis, ulcer symptoms on and off for about a year. Decided to take Omeprazole for a few weeks after repeated recommendations by my doc to heal the ulcer once and for all. An enormous mistake. 5 days in, suddenly panicky, dizzy, faint, heart beating painfully hard for hours, pulse sky high, numb hands and legs and an ambulance ride to the ER, I thought I was having a heart attack! Released the next day, they basically found nothing. Night after night, waking up in a panicked sweat feeling claustrophobic like I was losing it, unable to sleep due to the fear and pounding heartbeat. (And 2 kids to care for!)I was a complete mental and physical wreck. I have NEVER had anxiety or had a panic attack ever in my life so it was obvious these pills had done me in. Been off for 2 weeks, acupuncture and herbs to detox hopefully as quick as I can. DON’T TAKE this stuff!!!!",Marieski858

10,Omeprazole,GastritisDuodenitis,5.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"July 10, 2021",4,I am having really strong side effects with these meds.   I am not sure if they occur in the first few days.

11,Omeprazole,GastritisDuodenitis,3.0,,"July 5, 2021",5,"I had severe nausea and hunger pains, started taking Prilosec OTC, began to slowly help and my stool became a little off. Doctor said gastritis/GERD, 40mg omeprazole prescription, 30 days worth. Within a couple days it went downhill, every trip to the bathroom was terrifying, had strange color stool, strange texture, was so much undigested food and mucus I thought I had something else and was dying, not to mention the anxiety this medicine gave me was horrifying, would have insane panic attacks before bed, and every time the side affects hit I would nearly have a stroke my heart was racing so fast with nervousness. Various places in my stomach would burn and throb at various times, pain in my lower right abdomen and behind my ribs, I would have a sharp pain through my ribs and back that felt like all my organs were being destroyed right in front of me",SL
12,Omeprazole,GastritisDuodenitis,1.0,,"June 11, 2021",33,"Got diagnosed with Gastritis and was prescribed omeprazole for 5 weeks.Got the full package side effects - tingling in my arms and feet, buzzing in my back, buzzing in my left calf, weakness to the point where i was barely able to lift it, extreme anxiety, waking up during the night with my heart racing, pain and burning on the left under the ribs, lost 14 kilos in 3 weeks. Today it is 3 weeks since I stopped taking it, anxiety lifted 3 days ago and is no longer there, tingling in my arms and feet is gone, burning the stomach too, the only thing left is slight weakness in my left calf still, but that's improving slowly. I have an appetite, weight is going up steady. If you are reading this, hang in there, stay tough, it takes a while for that poison to wear off, keep yourself hydrated and take vitamins and electrolytes, probiotics help with anxiety, it gets better. I honestly thought this nightmare will never end. PPI - never again !",loilen

16,Omeprazole,GastritisDuodenitis,1.0,,"March 3, 2021",70,"This medication will drag you to a place where you really don't want to be. What I'm feeling is chest heaviness, dizziness, severe anxiety, panic episodes, shakiness, sweating, diarrhea shortness of breath. It is nothing to worry about, my symptoms got better after a few weeks. However the doctor made me start it again and I now know that everything that just randomly started going wrong with me is all linked to this medication. And when I say anxiety I mean severe amplified anxiety. Like the kind were you can't sleep at night because you panic thinking tonight is the night. Do not take this medication. Ever. You don't know anxiety until you take this. I'm not sure why this is even a med to begin with. Keep your head up and read my review. I promise you'll be ok after a few weeks. You're not dying.

17,Omeprazole,GastritisDuodenitis,7.0,,"February 26, 2021",2,"After trying pregabalin for nerve pain, it gave me gastritis and the most horrific reflux. I couldn't breathe. I started Omeprazole on the 7th of Jan 2021 and the reflux reduced within 2 days. I then bumped up to 40mg (20 twice a day) to help my stomach heal (on the 14th of Jan).During my time on it I've had some horrible gas and bloating with sharp pains in my groin and the feeling like I was going to have a horrible BM, but with nothing happening. I have IBS too which doesn't help. The main concern I have is the pressure in my groin that makes me feel like I need to pee.Reading down this page and I'm thinking Omeprazole is the cause of all these extra issues not gastritis. I kept taking it because the problems were still there, but thinking back they only started when I started the Omeprazole.I would highly recommend it for reflux, but stick to the 2 week warning.(I've had scans so I know it's gas)",Rothers

It helped with my acid reflux and ulcer but, the chest pain and stomach cramps is mild compared to what was happening to me before I was prescribed this medication. I take two pills every morning once a day, I think I'll reduce the dosage to one pill, and will see how it goes. Yes there are side effects, but what I went through before taking this I couldn't live a normal life. Try changing your diet.

23,Omeprazole,GastritisDuodenitis,1.0,,"March 19, 2020",36,I started taking omeprazole pill at 20mg dose It took a while to take some effect but still had breakthrough burning. 1 and a half weeks into taking this pill the horrendous side effects kicked in. I can’t even describe how horrible this medicine made me feel. I literally had the worst nausea imaginable. My stomach would literally spasm/convulse/ and tighten. Body fatigue to the point of nearly passing out at work. I’ve never felt so sickly in my entire life. I lost my appetite. I lost weight drastically (20 lbs in the span of 2 weeks). My doctor told me to try 40mg because of the breakthrough burning and that’s when I nearly checked myself into the ER. My coworkers were very concerned with me not looking or feeling like my typical self. That’s when I stopped taking the pill cold turkey. Within a couple days I regained my appetite and started eating and feeling better with no more nausea and stomach tightness. Honestly beware of this pill.,Dani

25,Omeprazole,GastritisDuodenitis,1.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"February 13, 2020",34,I was taking this medication for 10 months and I’m now into my third week of stopping. The first week-10 days off of it I suffered terrible rebound and severe stomach cramps. Thankfully through dietary changes and perseverance I can honestly say I’ve felt the best I have in a long time. Advice to anybody prescribe this medication... try and heal your condition through dietary changes and/or natural medication.

27,Omeprazole,GastritisDuodenitis,6.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"November 15, 2019",7,"I mean, I  completely won’t knock omeprazole. It works. This is my second time dealing with gastritis and my second time taking omeprazole for it. Yes, omeprazole has side effects, and I know it’s from the drug because it’s been the same feeling both times. (Slight chest pain, trapped gas, dizziness, slightly elevated heart rate upon motion and general unwell feeling) however, when compared to the worst side effects I get from gastritis (no appetite, constant nausea, cannot eat, I get severe anxiety that comes with it) the ones from the omeprazole definitely don’t seem so bad. I take it until I’m eating normally again and my stomach has healed, then I discontinue it. Usually about 3-4 weeks. All I can say is, yes the side effects suck but everyone’s different. My grandmother has been taking it for years for GERD and has zero adverse effects. Give it a shot, the worst it can do is not work for you.",Anna

I've been off work for a week and I finally went on line and did some research and I found out this is most likely withdrawal symptoms. I been have heartburn, pain near my belly button, chills, stomach growling, fatigue, sweats, burning in my legs, jaw pain, head aches, diarrhea, and shakiness. My urine color is good and I am not having bloody stools so I know that I'm not having major issues.
