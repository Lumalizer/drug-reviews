0,Olanzapine,Anorexia Nervosa,1,,"March 9, 2021",1,"I started taking olanzapine to aid my anxiety around eating. It has not, the drug makes me feel constantly sluggish and tired yet I still cannot sleep. I yearn to feel well-rested in the morning but instead I hardly get through the night and I feel awful. Sleeping was not even much of an issue before I took this medication. For me, it has only made things worse.I'm on 7.5 mg.",Jill
1,Olanzapine,Anorexia Nervosa,1,Taken for less than 1 month,"November 12, 2019",7,"Daughter prescribed olanzapine for eating issues and anxiety.  I see weight gain is a side effect.  I've only read one comment that says it is not a scary drug but as someone else pointed out, in UK, it's primarily used for paranoia etc.  Can anyone reassure me that I won't end up with a zombie of a daughter on 2.5mg, but one that looks physically healthier?   I'm scared her will-power will tell her to ignore hunger pangs anyway, so what will it really achieve, apart from messing with her brain?",WORRIED MUM
