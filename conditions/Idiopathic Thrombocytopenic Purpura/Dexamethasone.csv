0,Dexamethasone,Idiopathic Thrombocytopenic Purpura,3,,"January 23, 2018",6,I took 10mg/4 days which is recommended to anyone with ITP. I had side affects for almost a whole week I had a bloody nose off and on the whole time my vision changed couldn't drive and made me sleep a lot and a day after being off of it I had pain from my jaw all the way down to my butt. I couldn't move without feeling like I was going to break. The worst part of it all was when I told my doctor and they said it was not from the medication when it was. I didn't take any other prescription or non prescription drugs. It only made my platelets doubled in numbers and then dropped very fast.,Min89
1,Dexamethasone,Idiopathic Thrombocytopenic Purpura,5,Taken for less than 1 month,"April 27, 2017",6,"My platelet count went down to 15k; doctor prescribed this med. Took 10, 4mg, pills in the morning for 4 days then stopped. CBC Platelet count went up to 90k.  However for the 5 days that followed; I was in utter pain. Extreme abdominal pain, voice was hoarse, felt like my throat was on fire, headache and sensitivity to light, and the worse was the abdominal bloat. I couldn't move with it being laborious and having shortness of breath. Not a pill I would ever take again. A week later, CBC Platelets were back down to 15k. I can live with that.",Nstig8r1123
