0,Rituximab,Idiopathic Thrombocytopenic Purpura,5,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"September 1, 2019",6,"Had three courses of Rituxin.  1st course of 4 weeks failed.  2nd course gave me 16 months of remission.  3rd course yielded no results, so went on to Promacta.  Promacta did nothing for me.  Now, I take Nplate injections, which work for me over a year now.  I got ITP at 51 years old and am 55 now.  I'm chronic, and will and have fallen to zero counts, and single digits several times when untreated. I also occasionally supplement with low doses of Dexamethizone.",Anonymous
1,Rituximab,Idiopathic Thrombocytopenic Purpura,10,Taken for less than 1 month,"October 15, 2018",14,Treated for ITP with high dose dexamethasone short burst and then 120mg of prednisone daily for months...platelet counts varied from 9-60 thousand and the side effects of prednisone became unacceptable.  Then received rituximab weekly for 4 weeks (4 doses) except for the first dose initial dose which caused intense itching (treated with benadyl and slowing the infusion rate) the treatment was relatively benign. Nineteen months later my platelets have stabilized at 141 thousand (low normal). This treatment is definitely worth a try with (at least for me) a much better side effect profile than steroids,Bernie Z
