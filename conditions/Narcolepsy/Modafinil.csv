1,Modafinil,Narcolepsy,3.0,Taken for 10 years or more,"November 20, 2021",2,"Been taking this for 10 years or so. I  take 800mg a day along with Concerta 36-50 mg. My opinion? I don't like it. Never did from day one. I took Desoxyn for years before this. One small pill a day . My original Dr. gave me 5 mg. Desoxyn worked like a charm. He retired and  my present Dr. decided this combo is better, It's not. What I find it to be is, it keeps you in an awake state without the Concerta, a ""foggy"" awake state.  (regardless of dosage) I feel like I'm full of pills because the tablets are so large,  I got used to this ""dip"" you get where you feel like your in  trance for about 20 minutes..(even with one of the pills and it takes  hours to peak).  No matter how I juggle them I seem to stay more alert at night.. Desoxyn was 3 dollars and something for a months supply. THESE? Thank God I have a Prescription Card. I felt myself with the Desoxyn. It activated in minutes and lasted all day. No comparison. Great if you want to be a nightwatchman.",Beachgirl

3,Modafinil,Narcolepsy,9.0,,"August 17, 2021",4,"Provigil (modafinil):Diagnosis with Narcolepsy at 23 yrs old and now I am currently 41years old.  Saved me from quitting college. I now have 3 college diplomas. I run about 30+ miles a week.  Fall asleep no problem and can still take naps if need to. My dose is 200mg am and another 200mg at lunch. Will often supplement with caffeine beverage as long as it’s not after 4pm. I have slight cataplexy, anxiety, and both are treated with Effexor XR which goes nicely with provigil. There is a weird side effect, if I am not hydrated enough I will have itchy legs.  No rash or hives just uncontrollably itchy especially after a run in the summer. So if that happens and dermatologist can’t figure out, that’s your problem is you are not drinking enough. Sleep well y’all",Coach13.1
4,Modafinil,Narcolepsy,5.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"July 10, 2021",4,"Started taking Modafinil about a week ago at 100mg and noticed a big difference. I stayed awake the whole day without any naps and was able to drive 1.5 hrs which is unheard of. Day 3 I got tired midday and took another 100mg. Day 4 I tried 200mg at once in the morning and I was groovy. Day 5 I did the same thing but got tired in the afternoon. Consulted my Dr. again, he told me I may need higher dose. Today I did 200mg in the am, and a dose noon, still feel tired. Currently laying in bed because I don't have the energy to do anything else at this point. The wakefulness only lasts about 5 hours before I'm ready just knocked out. I desperately wanted this to work for me. The side effects are minimal, heavy chest the first 2 days; now just dry mouth. But it does very little for cognitive improvement, focus, and memory function for me. Sometimes it feels like I'm stoned on caffeine. I am envious of the people that it is consistently working for.",Malia

Then I had a doctor switch me to Modafinil bc it's ""less addictive"" & not as high of a controllable with the government.

6,Modafinil,Narcolepsy,9.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"May 10, 2021",5,"I experienced Narcolepsy symptoms my entire life (without cataplexy). I would fall asleep while driving, take naps in the bathroom floor at work, sneak off to sleep in my car during events. The sleep attacks were debilitating. I haven't been on this med long (only a few weeks) but I've felt incredibly better. It took about 4 days for it to work fully. I don't feel jittery or unnaturally focused, both of which Adderall causes. I simply feel like ""me"" just more awake. Don't even need my coffee. I take 100mg in the morning and 100mg in the afternoon. Some reviews say it has increased mood/ reduced depression but that hasn't been the case for me. Regardless, it is truly a life changer.Use GoodRX: It costs me $25 for a 30 day supply of 200mg pills",Kay

I've had instances where I have just suddenly crashed and fallen asleep while eating dinner, taking a bath, etc. Overall, it actually helps me stay functional, before I was on medication, I would be drinking 2 energy drinks per day just so I could stay awake through the day.

I had to fight the insurance to pay for it my doctor prescribed that after it was approved and I have to take 200 mg in the morning then  I would become myself I take that faithfully and another 200 mg at 1 p.m. and I do not have those episodes anymore of uncontrolled sleeping where I cannot function.

10,Modafinil,Narcolepsy,7.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"January 27, 2021",1,"I got diagnosed with Narcolepsy in 2017 and I was given modafinil after my Ritalin lost its effectiveness.  I started with 100mg 1x a day, then moved to 200mg 1x a day. It gives me terrible body aches and at times I wake up feeling like I got hit by a bus, but I also have a genetic connective tissue disorder - so they put me on baclofen. The Baclofen counteracts the pain and I no longer get the body aches. 200mg wears off after about 5 hours though and I find myself very sleep by noon, so I'm also supplementing 20mg of Ritalin with the 200mg of Modafinil.  With this combined regimen of medication, I am finding myself with more energy than I've had in years and feel like a fully functioning human being again.  Beware of some nausea and body aches and it not lasting very long, but other than that it's great.",Emah
11,Modafinil,Narcolepsy,2.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"January 23, 2021",3,modafinil was disappointing for me. I can sleep almost all day while on this med. I guess I'm one of those that it just does not work for.,Anonymous

I've been through a revolving door of prescribers and tried at least 12 different sedatives.

(Stay far far away unless blacking out and sending insane messages to old colleagues is your thing) I'm up to 200mg modafinil once a day and 100mg wellbutrin sr twice a day, and it feels as though I've been given my brain back. I'm exhausted when I go to bed and fall asleep quickly. I don't take sedatives to sleep for the first time in at least 6 years. My family and friends all tell me that I've completely changed; become more ""with it."" I honestly don't notice a difference or side effects.

My sleep doctor (which I now have) plus my respiratory therapist have been working with me 13 months now, looking for the right sleep apnea, mask and settings for me.  Nothing kept me awake so the doctor  put me on 100 mg Modafinil 1 or 2 pills, up to twice a day.  The dose that works for me is 2 pills. I am hyper all day long and its fantastic.

14,Modafinil,Narcolepsy,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"December 1, 2020",2,I suffered debilitating myalgia in my upper back that also traveled up to my jaw. I have TMJ and this med negatively affected that as well (frequent to constant lockjaw). I only took it for a week and by the seventh day I couldn't move because the back pain and my jaws were hurting so bad. This med was definitely not a good fit for me in treating narcolepsy.,Flossy

The first two weeks were riddled with side effects: dizzy, unbelievably dehydrated with drinking 48 oz of water daily, miserably red, dry eyes, but marginally awake for a few hours. Months later, I was up to 200 mg 2x/daily, and I found that so long as I drink at least 64 oz of water and get 90 minutes of rigorous exercise each day, I feel more like myself. Once it built up in my system and the side effects subsided, it's kind of like a small cup of coffee running in the background for seven or eight hours. So long as I get plenty of exercise before and after work and stay hydrated throughout the day, it generally gets me through most of the work day.",Vandam1

I usually take half a pill and I’m good to go for the entire work day. Before Provigil I was in danger of losing my job. I could not get out of bed. On weekends I would literally go to bed Friday night and not get dressed again until I forced myself out the door for work on Monday. After just a few days I felt like a new person! I don’t suffer any terrible side effects. The only thing is I have to make sure I am not talking excessively (as it tends to speed up my speech).  I now even go to the gym after work! Never ever would have dreamed of doing that previously! I am down 30 pounds (working hard at it) and I am enjoying my life! It gave me my life back!,LifeChanging

I was prescribed Ritalin twice a day for more than a decade.  After moving and changing doctor's was switched to Pemoline, which was the closest I ever felt to ""normal"", until it was pulled off the market for being linked with liver failure.  By then Modafinil had been approved by the FDA for use in treating excessive daytime sleepiness in Narcolepsy. It has been very helpful for daytime, though I can still fall asleep (nap) during the day and I notice that if I forget my 2nd (afternoon) dose, I'm not able to stay asleep through the night.",NotCoolMom

20,Modafinil,Narcolepsy,8.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"February 15, 2020",26,"Provigil (modafinil):This med has been very helpful for my excessive daytime sleepiness (Idiopathic Hypersomnia). Probably saved me from ending my career as a therapist altogether, although I’m limited to seeing half the usual number of clients. First 100 mg dose at 8 am and I’m good to go for about 4 hours—and quite talkative and energetic. By noon or 1 I’m getting quite tired and, even though I take my afternoon dose of 100 mg, the rest of the day I typically feel quite tense and often irritable. Tight knot in upper back. Seeing clients is a real challenge. My life remains pretty limited by my idiopathic hypersomnia but I’m so relieved to at least be able to work enough to support my family.

21,Modafinil,Narcolepsy,10.0,Taken for 10 years or more,"February 8, 2020",8,"I have been taking 400 to 600mg of modifinil, each day for 20 years, due to narcolepsy, and excessive daytime sleepiness. The Only side effect I have ever noticed, was a decrease in falling asleep during the day. Which is exactly what I need. It took nearly 20 years to get diagnosed with this sleep deprivation. I had many encounters with the law, and driving both before and after being diagnosed. However far less, after. I still have to have Ritalin, or some amphetamine, in the event, the current dose of 400mg a day wears off. Ritalin helps me on a shorter duration, such as in the evening, when an hour or two of wakefulness is needed, rather than the 12 hours typically provided to me by provigil/modifinil. Modifinil is a life saver for me. I was a danger to myself and others, without it. However, $5, 249 for 180 pills, a 90 day supply, is ridiculous.My fixed S. S.
