In my opinion, Teva is the most effective generic, Mallinckrodt has been the worst, it makes me tired and gives heartburn which I never have normally. I just pick up a refill, new mfg, Alvogen. Took it a hour ago and keep nodding off. Looks like another generic to avoid.",tired in NY
1,Adderall,Narcolepsy,7.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"December 15, 2021",0,"It helps bring my fatigue levels from a 2/10 to probably a 5/10. Not a cure all but definitely gives me more energy than I am able to have on my own. It does give me tachycardia for about an hour after taking it, and I'm a 34 Year old without heart issues. That is the only down side.I do not feel ""high"" or ""speedy"" on this, but maybe because I'm so chronically low I'd have to take a substantial dose to feel overwhelmed like that. I have taken 15 MG for 1.5 years now for chronic fatigue syndrome.",Theanthean
2,Adderall,Narcolepsy,9.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"November 17, 2021",2,"I was diagnosed with Idiopathic Hypersomnia and ADD in May, and this was taken with Modafinil twice a day (10mg). While Modafinil is a different story, Adderall has been wonderful for me. I take Amphetamine Salts and those worked a lot better than the generic, Dextroamp-Amphetamine. It's a nice boost in wakefulness and it's changed my life being able to finally focus on daily activities, and classes too. I'm quitting Modafinil because it interferes with my asthma and really screws with my heart rate, and will look into either 20mg twice a day, or maybe even Adderall XR. But the Salts have worked great for my sister, and same for me!",Mark
3,Adderall,Narcolepsy,2.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"August 20, 2021",0,I have been taking generic Adderall for many years and have never had any problems until I started taking the Lannett generic.

4,Adderall,Narcolepsy,7.0,,"January 6, 2021",18,"I was diagnosed with a severe case of narcolepsy about a year ago. I always thought it was my chronic fatigue that made me feel so sleepy all the time. I was finally referred to a sleep specialist who ordered a night and day time sleep study. When I received the results he told me I was a very sleepy person, his worst case in many years. I have been taking 20MG Adderall 3x a day. It does help but I'm still extremely tired throughout the day. The sleep doctor advised me in September that there's a newer medication that can be added to my Adderall but insurance didn't like to approve it and that in 6 months hopefully it will be easier to prescribe. I've seen somewhere that 60MG a day is the max for treating ADHD but that 90MG is the max for treating narcolepsy. I'm curious if that dose would improve my symptoms. Overall I'm happy with the medication as I never notice any side effects. I just want to feel more awake and less sleepy.",Decaf920

6,Adderall,Narcolepsy,10.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"October 10, 2020",36,I was switched to Adderall but after 2 years switched to Ritalin. Adderall seems to open up parts of your brain best left closed. I started to see a 12 year old boy in the yard during the day he would be gone when I went to talk with him.

7,Adderall,Narcolepsy,6.0,,"October 9, 2020",12,I have been soooo sleepy for the past 15 years of my life. I finally found a PA that listened to me about my sleepiness. She has been great. I can not afford the recommended sleep study. I am currently taking 10mg extended release. It has helped but I am still falling asleep at work. My PA will meet with me in after a month on it. I’m not sure if I need an increased dosage or if it’s not working on me. It’s a struggle still. I don’t want to feel hopeless that I can’t find help.,LexinTex
8,Adderall,Narcolepsy,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"September 17, 2020",54,"This medicine is god send. I have been suffering with narcolepsy for about 5 years. Had no idea what I was doing wrong that I cannot keep my eye open. I am talking about sleeping for 8-9 hours and then waking up and wanting to go back to sleep. I am a public school teacher and I had no choice but to be at work all day. That was a struggle and I was embarrassed to even tell my coworkers. This summer, so many unpleasant events happened in my life, I decided to talk to my psychiatrist about unable to concentrate and the excessive sleeping pattern. He wanted me to try adderall and bam!! I haven’t taken a nap since August . I do not have any side effects, not glittery, no overworking , nothing. Just ready to start the day and get in with my life. I usually go to bed around 9:30pm and sleeps well. I take 20 mg twice a day. But if you miss a dose, back to square one. I am religiously on a schedule and take them at the same time everyday.

9,Adderall,Narcolepsy,6.0,Taken for 5 to 10 years,"April 12, 2020",248,Generic Adderall is not the same. I feel immediately awful when I realize they switched me to generic dextro amp (amp salts works not sure what brand. I heard Teva might have moved distribution centres and have been alternating approved cheaper alternative ingredients. Well guess what they don’t work AT ALL. Check the generic brands when you get your script filled and see how you feel. The old generic brand I took worked just fine. I cannot get out of bed for weeks because whatever similar generic cheap alternatives they are using do not make the cut. Welcome back debilitating fatigue!,trinehundop3

11,Adderall,Narcolepsy,10.0,,"November 20, 2019",64,"I was diagnosed with a sleep disorder/excessive daytime sleepiness and my physician prescribed me Adderall. After I found the dose that worked best for me (30mg in the morning and 10-20mg in the afternoon) I felt like a new person. I usually sleep anywhere from 12-18 hours a day when I don’t have classes or work (I don’t have to force myself up on these days with 2 alarms). I can still nap but they are not nearly as long as they used to be (3-8 hours). My grades have improved and most importantly, my attendance of class has improved! I used to sleep through class, but now I can go because my body isn’t begging for sleep. Overall it is an extremely helpful drug to treat narcolepsy/excessive daytime sleepiness. I finally feel like I have my life back! My only complaint is the dry mouth I experience every so often. I also still feel rather tired some days but it is not as NEAR as torturous as it used to be.

12,Adderall,Narcolepsy,9.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"October 8, 2019",18,"I was recently diagnosed with Narcolepsy in early 2019. I was started on Adderrall, but it took about 6 months to get the regimen that worked for me. I was quite sick at the stomach for about 3 months with nausea, and headaches. I take 30 mg at 9 am, and 10 mg at 1 pm. Finally, it's working well to a certain degree.  I still need at least two naps during the day and have most of my energy in the morning and early afternoon. Come 7-8 pm, I'm literally exhausted. I realized how well the medication worked after I missed a dose. I wondered why I was yawning all day and barely able to stay awake. It was because I had forgotten to take my Adderrall. Despite how well it works, I still seem to yawn almost constantly. I would not be able to get through the day without it. It's not 100 percent fix, but I can function for most of the day using it. So, that's a plus for me.",Sherri

So I have taken Adderall XR 10mg (once in the morning) Just for a few days now. The first time was amazing and I actually had a road trip to take that day and I drove a whole 12 hours with no problems! That is really good considering I need a nap just an hour after waking up usually. There were still the positive effects but the side effects are just so bad. Food just doesn’t seem appealing anymore and I have constant headaches and stomach issues.Thats not even the bad part, I have had terrible hallucinations and makes me very paranoid and scared to do anything in my day. At some points of the day I feel fine but others I feel those side effects and episodes of tense muscles that tremble when I hallucinate and increased heart rate and heavy breathing. I keep reading all these amazing things about this drug and I want that for me too. If anyone has experienced I would love the feedback:)",Logan

Before filling your script call around and find out which brands the pharmacies carry. If it's Mallinckrodt find another pharmacy to fill at. I can take any brand of Adderall and it works for me without many side effects EXCEPT Mallinckrodt. I don't know what they do to their pills but they make me sick. They give me a severe headache, extreme nausea and abdominal pain. If you look online you will see that other people report the same. So shop around for something other than Mallinckrodt.

Now I can be a father, husband and most important a normal human being again!I take 20 mg, 3xs a day. It is still not enough to keep me from napping twice a day before 5pm, but it helps.  I still feel as if I’m in a fog for most of my morning and afternoon, but at least I'm not worried of crashing my car or falling asleep on the job. Personally I have not suffered side effects. My blood pressure is very good, I don’t get jitters, and the medicine actually calms me tremendously.

21,Adderall,Narcolepsy,8.0,,"July 20, 2018",24,"I was diagnosed with narcolepsy after about 5 years-1995 to 2000. A sleep study doctor diagnosed me as having this disorder.  After trying methylphenidate and then provigil I still had EDS. I even had a doctor prescribe (Desoxyn) which didn't help. Adderall XR also was not effective enough, so I was prescribed 30mg of adderall I.R. one a day. Narcolepsy causes sleep deprivation causing anxiety, depression, and nights of no sleep at all.  Most doctors hesitate to prescribe medication for these side effects. Finally found that Belsomra helps on those sleepless nights. Adderall is not the 'magic bullet' by itself and the stigma of having to take Adderall, Klonopin,, Wellbutrin, and .Belsomra gives narcoleptics anxiety and fear to ask physicians to prescribe medications that almost make us feel normal.",sk

All of your stories are completely familiar, and Adderall absolutely does all that's being said that it does..the reality though is that taking this drug at high doses over an extended number of years is shameful to many parts of the body. You become essentially the same as any Meth user..this drug is simply a ""cleaner"" form, if you will. The drug has rotted my teeth despite extra care taken, and I now have dentures.

25,Adderall,Narcolepsy,,Taken for 5 to 10 years,"August 12, 2017",63,"The efficacy of Adderall in any condition that you take it over is dependent upon the quality of the generic brand that your pharmacy carries. Although a pharmacist will not want to tell you this, a generic product can vary plus or -20% variation from the  brand-name drug. This was A result of the Hatch-Waxman Act.  Moreover, and most disturbingly, only the generic company itself knows  The results that they conducted and required for a generic manufacturer to manufacturer a generic drug require  Bioequivalency testing. However, they, and I emphasize ""They"" because it is only the generic company itself that conducts the test and knows the results besides the FDA. Only the generic firm and the FDA knows the exact test results. Research different generic reviews, because this makes all the difference in your experience with generic Adderall IR",Drkatzjr27

Anyway, my doctor prescribed Adderall because I simply could not stay awake in class, driving, riding the bus, watching movies, doing homework, etc. Basically everything. I remember the first dose I took. I felt like a normal person. Not hyper or overstimulated (my doc was worried about this because I also have bipolar I), just normal.

It also gave me ""false confidence"" and just overall made me more outgoing than I usually. Also I found that the first time I used it it gave me quite a high, which I eventually got used to.

The only thing I don't like about it is the crash after the med wears off. I can tell a huge difference. And it is also disappointing that I have to take meds to stay awake each day. But overall, I would say I'm very thankful for it.",Biote

This is the first time I have ever stayed awake through a movie, and been able to sit and read without nodding off. I am still my normal, calm self. But I just do not have the compulsion to sleep.

46,Adderall,Narcolepsy,10.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"July 22, 2013",60,For 5 years I suffered from hypothyroidism which turned out to be Hashimotos. Which I take thyroid (natural thyroid medication). Once my thyroid was under control myself and doctor were confused on why I was so tired. I would have seizures when I was completely exhausted. Very scary! They thought I had panic attacks but not so! The seizures were all part narcolepsy which apparently can mask under hypothyroidism. I now take 30mg of Adderall XR a day. It is not enough but just really happy I can get through the day without feeling like someone has given me a bottle of sleeping pills. Adderall is my wonder pill and no side effects.,Kld

However, I developed a severe spinal disease, fibro, and arthritis. I had to give in to taking pain meds which interfered with my Adderall dosage. I currently take 40mg. I have found this dose ineffective for the past several years. My family doctor prescribes my meds and doesn't feel comfortable titrating up to 60mg. I weigh 335mg as well. I am frustrated and feel exhausted most of the day.",driftwoodms14

The CFS came long after the FMS but Adderall 20 mg 3 x's daily has made my life bearable, enabled me to stay awake, boosted my energy (I also have Hashimoto's disease - hypothyroid) and has provided me with a feeling of normalcy.  I see my doctor every 3 months for blood work and medical care.  Got a new script today but insurance wants a pre-authorization which will take 3-4 days and I am out of this medication.

54,Adderall,Narcolepsy,9.0,,"October 4, 2009",85,"I have been on Adderall (60 mg) for 16 months (I am 21 years old). I was sleeping 16-20 hrs a day and when awake I was lethargic and had a compulsion sleep. I also have severe chronic pain, refractory depression, and panic disorder. So with so many problems I could hardly do a thing. Adderall was ideal because it helped treat my narcolepsy, it reduced the sedation from the opioids I take, it actually treats pain when added to opioids, it helped my depression which did not respond to over 40 drugs, and feeling better I stared to conquer my agoraphobia. It can't say it is a ""cure"" because I still struggle. I can still fall asleep, even when talking to a friend. Only problem was a little bruxism when I started and when the dose went up.",raraider

I have suffered with extreme fatigue and excessive sleepiness since I was a teenager, I'm  38 now. My doctors have tried me on everything from sleeping pills, to antidepressants, nothing worked. A friend suggested Adderall, I researched it, talked to my doctor about it and we tried Provigil first, which did help, but I was still falling asleep driving, reading, etc. Switched to Adderall. I was so happy I nearly cried when I was telling my doctor how much better I feel. I wish I would have tried this years ago.",won2bfree

I have the energy to enjoy life again.  I do have difficulty sleeping, and also since I do not take XR can ""crush"" it  if I forget my second dose.
