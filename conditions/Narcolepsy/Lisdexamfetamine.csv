0,Lisdexamfetamine,Narcolepsy,8,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"November 11, 2021",0,"31y F. Suffered from EDS for last 5yrs, finally got appropriate sleep studies two months ago. Have tried Provigil, Nuvigil, Sunosi, all did not do very much for me. Started Vyvanse and now take 50mg in AM, 20mg around midday. Big difference though it is more difficult to get out of bed in the AM now. Takes about an hour to kick in then I'm good until next dose. I metabolize it quickly so it doesn't last as long as its should even with the xtra 20mg in the PM as a booster. I've tried Adderall ER in PM as booster but makes me feel woozy for first 2 hours so switched to the 20mg Vyvanse. Will be replacing the 20mg Vyvanse with Wakix soon though because I'm falling asleep driving home still and 70mg is max dose. I work 2 jobs and need to stay awake from 5am to at least 8pm. Better than my life before, though not quite where I need to be. I also notice I can get more agitated easier now. Other than that and feeling very sluggish upon waking up in AM, I have no side effects.",napqueen967
1,Lisdexamfetamine,Narcolepsy,10,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"August 22, 2021",0,"I originally was put on this medication for my ADHD. I was on it for 2-3 years. I didn’t take it for a week & that’s when my narcolepsy symptoms started. I couldn’t get on a schedule to take it. I would wake up late & didn’t want to take it & then stay up late. The bright side is that incident lead to my narcolepsy diagnosis. Taking Vyvanse covered up my narcolepsy symptoms. Prior I was diagnosed with hypersomnia AND insomnia… Anyway, my side effects are dry mouth, thirst, lack of appetite/forget to eat and in the first 2 hours I can be a little more emotional (not sure if that’s really related). I have taken from 90mg-30mg. What worked best for me was 30mg @ A.M. & then 40mg at lunch. This helped with the eating & making sure it lasted the whole day. I would say it lasts 10+ hours. But when I was only on 40mg I felt it just lasted maybe 6 hours. Overall great drug",Kelp
2,Lisdexamfetamine,Narcolepsy,10,Taken for less than 1 month,"June 29, 2019",12,"I tried everything for my Narcolepsy- closest I came to feeling ok was on Concerta but it seemed like my body burned through it very quickly and I was able to sleep on it without much effort (I even used it during a sleep study) no increased focus, my mind was scattered all day, and I was very irritable coming down off it.  Concerta lasted at most 1-2 hrs for me before I started to crash with painful exhaustion.  Not this.  This I took 10 hours ago- 10!!!- and I still am going strong.  This is the best medication I have ever been prescribed for my Narcolepsy.  My husband has noticed a huge change in my behavior, mood, and well being.  I recommend this to anyone who was losing hope like I was.  I take 70 mg a day.",Babs
3,Lisdexamfetamine,Narcolepsy,9,,"March 14, 2019",14,"I was terrified to start Vyvanse (lisdezamfedamine) because of my awful experiences with other stimulants; I had extreme anxiety that lasted for several weeks on 6 days of Adderall XR 5mg, and Concerta XR made me even more drowsy.  Amphetamines metabolize too slowly and methylphenidates don't work correctly, according to a genetic test I took. Though Vyvanse is in the amphetamine class, the fact that it's a pro-drug (meaning it's inactive until the body converts it to amphetamine), my body doesn't seem to hang onto it like it did with Adderall. Combined with modafinil 200mg and a coffee a day, it works very well with keeping me awake and weirdly has actually reduced my anxiety. If you took a genetic test and it showed up with having problems metabolizing amphetamines too slowly and causing problems, you might do better on Vyvanse instead. Side effects for me are dry mouth and cold toes/fingers, and my deductible makes it $240 after a $60 off vyvanse coupon, but it's worth it in my opinion.",SleepyDude

6,Lisdexamfetamine,Narcolepsy,10,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"March 25, 2014",10,"My experience with this medicine has helped me through school very well and I don't fall asleep in school, I pay attention very well. It doesn't wear off until I get home. Then I'm really tired but the really tired part is okay I don't really mind. This is my key for school. I don't take it in the summer and whenever it's time for school. My Vyvanse is a really big help.",Anonymous
7,Lisdexamfetamine,Narcolepsy,6,,"November 11, 2013",25,"I was prescribed Vyvanse 50 mg for the treatment of my narcolepsy w/o cataplexy & hypersomnia. The first 2 weeks were great but I found my body quickly adjusted to this medicine making it almost completely ineffective by the end of the first month. The 2nd month, I went to 60 mg. this month, I'm on 70mg. I'm not falling asleep while driving, however I am still having episodes of extreme sleepiness and sleeping extremely deeply at times. I'm also going between sleeping 5 hours to 15 a night. My main concern is: I'm on the maximum dose so just where do I go from here?!  I also have bipolar disorder/anxiety & I've found my need for anxiety medicine to be almost nonexistent, which is a great bonus.",Sleepymomof2
8,Lisdexamfetamine,Narcolepsy,8,,"November 7, 2011",14,Vyvanse (lisdexamfetamine):Its my 3rd day and I love the fact I can function and take care of my 5 month old without struggling. I'm on the 30 mg only reason I didn't give it a ten is I take it at 6 am and by 2pm I'm super tired again...other than that love it.,Anonymous
9,Lisdexamfetamine,Narcolepsy,10,,"March 28, 2010",20,"Vyvanse (lisdexamfetamine):I have sleep apnea, and somewhere in the last 7 months developed narcolepsy. I almost lost my job, and spent 4.5 months on disability because I couldn't stay awake at my desk. I was falling asleep in my car, as a passenger and a driver, falling asleep at diner, on the phone, everywhere. So when I went back to work, I thought I was better, I had been treating my bi-polar with a lot of good medications, so I really felt ready to go back to work. Well about 2 days back to work I was falling asleep again. It was miserable. My sleep Dr wanted me to take a stimulant, and my Psychiatrist prescribed Vyvanse. The first 60 mg pill did nothing. I was falling asleep again. So my doctor advised me to take another 60 mg pill. It worked! I'm doing much better.",Ceigeme
10,Lisdexamfetamine,Narcolepsy,9,,"June 29, 2009",36,"Vyvanse (lisdexamfetamine):I was constantly struggling to stay awake (sometimes when driving too) and I'm pretty sure I almost lost my new job (started in 02/2009) before training ended. I'm also sure that they doubted I'd be very effective on the phones after training. Also, at the end of training, we had to make an 85% on the final exam to continue to be employed there and I'm sure they thought I would fail. Right before the exam, I quit taking Lyrica, which decreased the severity of the sleep narcolepsy, but didn't eliminate it. Vyvanse has greatly improved my effectiveness at work and I even got a promotion less than 3 weeks after I began taking it! I've had basically no side effects and now with not having to fight to stay awake, Vyvanse relieves a lot of stress and anxiety!",JRTuttle4
