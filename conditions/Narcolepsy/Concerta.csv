1,Concerta,Narcolepsy,9,Taken for less than 1 month,"May 7, 2021",4,"I have both mixed sleep apnea and narcolepsy, I have been taking 18mg Concerta pill each morning for 6 days now. From day  1 the continual tiredness and falling asleep has stopped, I am able to concentrate and focus at work for prolonged periods of time, where as before I would take a break wash my face every 30 minutes to try to avoid feeling sleepy.Now I am sleeping better ( using CPAP machine) and awake as normal during the day…really happy with the results….Also so far I have had no side effects other than on day 3 my vision was a bit weird for about an hour then returned to normal….Overall a positive experience",Amir
2,Concerta,Narcolepsy,6,Taken for less than 1 month,"March 16, 2021",1,"Concerta ER helped some with my narcolepsy, but caused me to be highly irritable. I am bipolar which could have exacerbated and contributed to the mood swings.  I have decided to try other meds.",Anonymous
3,Concerta,Narcolepsy,3,,"February 21, 2021",0,"I took this medication along with another narcolepsy medication for about 3 months. At first, I was taking Armodafinil 250mg and Concerta 36mg ER every morning. I became extremely anxious and paranoid about irrational things. I also became very OCD as well, which is not normal for me. After explaining that to my doctor, I ended up reducing Armodafinil to 150mg and continued the Concerta 36mg ER. I did this for about a month but I didn’t feel like the medication was benefiting me enough to continue taking it. I also had dry mouth when on the medication and I was physically unable to yell. My mouth and throat felt like sandpaper. Personally I didn’t think the meds were helping me enough with attention span and alertness. I quit Concerta 36mg ER and went back to just taking Armodafinil 250mg. I have been focusing a lot on my diet and exercise which I felt has made a huge difference. Also prioritizing my mental health. But everyone with narcolepsy is different!",Lullypup
4,Concerta,Narcolepsy,6,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"October 30, 2020",3,"I take this med Concerta for narcolepsy - 36 mg 2 times daily and it works ok -  the side effects are troubling. Mood swings, irritability, foggy brain, memory issues.  The good and the bad are an even balance at this point.",fuzzy
5,Concerta,Narcolepsy,9,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"December 26, 2018",19,"I had difficulty staying awake. I was taking all kind of meds for mood disorders and most of them caused drowsiness and weight gain. In 2016, I did a sleep study test, but didn't qualify for a CPAP machine. So I tried narcoleptic meds but they didn't work well for me. My doctor prescribed Adderall XR which was great for a while until I needed higher dosages to function but the side effects weren't worth taking the med. So I stopped all stimulants. Did a sleep study test in January of 2018 and was diagnosed with mild sleep apnea. The CPAP machine wasn't enough alone for the narcolepsy. Now I take Concerta and feel alert and I usually wake up before 6am. Concerta helps me and I only take 27mg.",Jetter775
6,Concerta,Narcolepsy,9,,"March 31, 2017",23,"I have had narcolepsy my whole life and for the longest time I thought it was because I was lazy. As a straight-A student, I didn't understand why it was so difficult for me to get up, stay awake, and make my body match up with my motivation. Literally the first day I started taking this medication, I could stay awake in all of my classes and I felt the passion and love for learning I always had as a kid. For the past years, watching Netflix was the go-to rather than homework just because I couldn't muster the physical nor mental energy to follow through. While I have been successful in my academics, after concerta, I could study for longer, I could do more things, and I could finish my work faster. A 27 mg dose works all day (100 lbs).",katiemariea
7,Concerta,Narcolepsy,2,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"March 26, 2016",6,"This med is not good.   It doesn't work it only last 7 hours I'm taking ritalin also 10mg, and 54mg of concerta. I will not recomemnd it ialso take  ritalin for 3 years and it does not last long no good .",Omtc
8,Concerta,Narcolepsy,9,Taken for less than 1 month,"May 18, 2013",26,"Although I was never officially diagnosed with narcolepsy, about 10 years ago, I began slowing down, literally my energy and motivation kept going down and down, etc. I longed to be normal and play with my kids like I once had. Finally, we seemed to have found the right medication and now we just need to adjust the dosage. It has been nearly a month and its been a little rocky because of the adjustments needed but I feel like I am becoming the Jackie I once was. I just need to check more about the side effects, etc. So far, so good.",Jaxcie
9,Concerta,Narcolepsy,10,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"January 16, 2013",37,"My doctor originally put me on this medication because I thought I was ADD on account of concentration and focus issues. After my first dose leveled out and needed to be adjusted we realized I may be narcoleptic since my main complaint was daytime sleepiness along with the focus and concentration issues. I have a sleep study coming up to confirm the diagnosis but this medication has save my life. I can now stay away all day, focus and concentrate, and my moods are even better. This is very important as a wife, stay at home mom of 3, and a college student. It works wonderfully for me! I do find I drink more water and crave cigarettes more but the trade off is definitely worth the benefits I am getting!",Jecca
10,Concerta,Narcolepsy,9,,"June 18, 2010",52,"I have narcolepsy and OSA along with severe Restless Legs Syndrome. I've been on Ritalin and 2 different non narcotic medicines and they simply stopped being effective after a short period of time. FINALLY my Doctor put me on 54mg of Concerta along with an 18 mg of Concerta, totaling 72mg and it's perfect. I can still take a short nap but I am able to finally stay awake longer then 2 hours. It took 3 sleep studies and about 5 different drugs but I think I finally am beginning to feel optimistic!",susan_2009
