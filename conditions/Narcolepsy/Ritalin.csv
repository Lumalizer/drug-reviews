0,Ritalin,Narcolepsy,9.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"January 27, 2021",5,"In 2017 after years of struggling with sleep issues I got myself a sleep study.  It turned out I had Narcolepsy without cataplexy after a full night time study and MSLT. At first I was taking 10mg of Ritalin 2x a day, that wasn't working so she switched me to 10mg of Ritalin 4x daily. I was finding that I'd get terrible headaches from it so she tried me on Provigil 200mg. That alone wasn't working as your body adjusts to it. I started supplementing with 10mg of Ritalin 1x a day. That also wasn't working. I now take Provigil 200mg at 5am and supplement that with 20mg of Ritalin at noon and move on to another 10mg of Ritalin around 4pm and I'm getting through my 12 hour work days, plus still have energy when I get home!  It's absolutely wonderful to feel like a normal functioning human being again. No headaches, no anxiety, concentration is perfect and I feel like me again. Adjust your meds if it's not working, fight to feel better.",Emah
1,Ritalin,Narcolepsy,9.0,,"October 11, 2020",5,"In a single year, I was diagnosed w/intracranial hypertension, narcolepsy + severe sleep apnea. I use an ASV bc My brain forgets to breathe at night. Before Ritalin, my ASV didn't help much. I'm a 35 yr old F + I've tried Provigil, Nuvigil, Adderall, Sunsoni, & only 80mg of Ritalin ÷ in doses of 40mg 2× day has WORKED. My life is back & my apnea scores are lowest EVER. My neurologist can't believe it. Ritalin keeps my brain active so I breathe at night. Push thru the side effects; they WILL GO AWAY!",Punky
2,Ritalin,Narcolepsy,3.0,Taken for 10 years or more,"September 7, 2020",11,"I was diagnosed with excessive daytime sleepiness in the 90's.  I took Ritalin twice a day for more than a decade.  I found it was like being on a roller coaster.  My first dose was mid-morning and it would take at least 30 minutes before it started kicking in.  It ""peaked"" about 2 hours after consuming the dose where I felt awake, alert and full of energy for a very short time.  Then it's effects slowly wore off, leaving me feel completely out of it, depressed, slow, un-motivated.  I took the 2nd dose mid-afternoon, and it's effectiveness ran the same course.  It was a struggle getting through every day.",NotCoolMom
3,Ritalin,Narcolepsy,5.0,,"July 26, 2020",6,"This drug killed my creative spirit. I began taking it 1.5 years ago for excessive sleepiness. I was diagnosed with sleep apnea and got a CPAP, but in the meantime I was on this.It kept me awake, but after I got the CPAP, it became my morning boost.I write romance novels, and around the time I went on this I began struggling to write. I went from producing a book every 2-3 months to producing NOTHING for over a year.I got a therapist to discuss my problems writing. One day, I succeeded in telling her exactly what the problem was. ""It's like everyday life, and dishes and children and laundry are all the crazy waves on the top of the ocean, and in order to write, I need to sink down deep into the sea. Not only do I have no desire to go there, I actively avoid it."" As soon as I heard myself, I realized, IT'S THE RITALIN.I stopped taking it and saw a huge change. Within a month, my creative life returned to normal. This can be an amazing drug, but proceed with caution!",Amy6152

5,Ritalin,Narcolepsy,9.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"August 11, 2019",19,I started on Ritalin for narcolepsy at 10mg twice a day. Did not keep me awake. Went to 20mg twice a day still didn't work well. 30 mg twice a day is working well. I feel so much better and I'm more active than I have been in years.,Dickandjane
6,Ritalin,Narcolepsy,9.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"August 21, 2018",30,"I was recently diagnosed with narcolepsy after a sleep study. I was nearly passing out while driving so often that it was hindering my life. I couldn't play with my 3 year old, and I couldn't clean or take care of myself. After a bad experience with Nuvigil, I was prescribed ritalin, and I take 15mg 2x a day. I am happier, I can drive and spend time with my daughter without having to lay down every hour. I'm able to do my college course work without putting it off until the last moment. Ritalin has changed my life.",Yooji
7,Ritalin,Narcolepsy,1.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"July 29, 2018",13,"I have narcolepsy w/cataplexy and was prescribed Ritalin.Doc started me on a low dose to be taken twice day. The first 2 days I felt awake & alert, didn’t nap till 4:30 pm.  After that, I just got sleepy.  Never had that get-up-and-go like those first few days. Now after being on it for over a month, about 15 min after dosing I’m falling asleep. Literally head bobbing. I nap off and on all day long like before I was on Ritalin or I feel sick. I also notice that my chronic pain is heightened. Everything seems magnified on live wire. My eyes hurt, I’mmore sensitive to light & have daily headaches on top of my chronic migraines.I finally see my neurologist tomorrow & hopefully he’ll have an alternative plan for me.",“Sleepy-all-the-time”
8,Ritalin,Narcolepsy,8.0,,"July 21, 2018",19,"Let me start by stating that I am a 24 year old female with history of Idiopathic Hypersomnia, coarctation of the aorta and patent ductus arteriosus (PDA). I was recently in a car accident and received my second concussion. Upon visiting my neurologist for headaches/migraine complaints I brought to his attention my debilitating fatigue I've experienced since the last concussion. I've been to multiple doctors and they pushed aside this symptom. I was almost in tears when my neurologist prescribed Ritalin. Day 3: improved concentration AND more energy!. So far so good. I was worried I would have problems because of my heart conditions but it is anatomic and not rhythmic so I'm okay! He also assured this will help with weight loss which is great! Hope to continue to see great results with this medication.",ncos3
9,Ritalin,Narcolepsy,8.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"April 11, 2018",9,"Had Narcolepsy from age 5 due to brain swelling. Ritalin has definitely helped. I can do a lot of things other than sleeping when I am on it.... When I am on it  sometimes I Hyperventilate however. I take in everything around me (sounds, sights, smells). And I do worry sometime does it overload my brain and in long term would that end up making more problems down the road? Also because I need to be put on a higher does because my body becomes use to it. Pupils are always big on these meds (so I wear sunglasses to look after my eyes when I am out. Heart rate resting sits around 130bpm and goes up when going to the gym or working out. And cannot do long distances running. My hands shake a lot often need help from husband to drink tea as it can be difficult. All in all I guess it does sound bad my side effects but it gives me my life back. I gives me time were I am not tired so I will do it.",ShortyGirl
10,Ritalin,Narcolepsy,8.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"April 4, 2017",18,"When I was first diagnosed with narcolepsy at 13, I started with Ritalin and was taking about 40mg per day and definitely helped with my narcolepsy but wasn't strong enough to keep me fully awake and repress my cataplexy. I now take 81mg of concerta and 10mg of ritalin in the mornings and if needed another 10-20mg ritalin in the afternoons or when feeling tired. It's definitely been a life saver especially during class or when I'm out. Didn't have or had any significant side effects and am so glad to have been introduced to it",jezzml
11,Ritalin,Narcolepsy,1.0,,"February 6, 2017",10,"Hi I was Diagnosed when I was 6 years old and I am now 25 years old. I have taken Provigil, Adderall, Nuvigil, Ritalin, and now  methylphenidate ER. I could not take the recent medication due the side effect I use to get all the time  and it wasn't until I started taking folican xr that my life had change . I felt like I was never diagnose at all . I started taking folican when I was maybe in middle school up until a year ago . I was put on another medication which is methylphenidate which seem to make me more tired . The things I could do as a person without narcolepsy  I can no longer do them . Emotion that by itself put strain on me . This by itself seem to do nothing . 10mg 1-2 a day . When I was on folican I took 15 mg 3 times",sleeping beauty BD
12,Ritalin,Narcolepsy,4.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"November 11, 2016",27,Recently diagnosed with narcolepsy and was given provigal. That did nothing. Given Ritalin and this is doing nothing either.

13,Ritalin,Narcolepsy,,Taken for 5 to 10 years,"September 22, 2016",35,"I have narcolepsy, and have been taking Ritalin for about 20 years. I was diagnosed with depression about 7 years ago, most recently taking Effexor, and citalopram. About 6 days ago I spiralled down fast and hard. Couldn't eat, sleep, reason anything good, was crying hysterically, horrible feelings, felt like I was slowly going crazy. I had stopped taking my Ritalin thinking it would keep me awake. Today I took my Ritalin, went for a nap and woke up clear. I was calm, it's been 8 hrs of no crying, no churning inside, no hysterics, I am sleeping, I can can think things through....absolutely night and day.

Have not (and won't) increased dosage in over 5 yrs.  Retired now so it's easier to adjust mg.

18,Ritalin,Narcolepsy,9.0,,"July 5, 2012",250,"I struggle with the Lethargic-type Depression. The Symptoms: lack of motivation, laziness, apathy, a-sociability (not caring about having others or relationships; NOT the same as anti-social), flat effect, low energy, excess sleeping, difficulty processing and connecting-the-dots; like when reading things for example, poor concentration, lack of drive, staying at home all day doing nothing, not getting a job, lack of determination and perseverance, giving up easily, low attention-span, etc. Ritalin works great for ""Lethargic Depression"", and even MORE so when combined with my Cymbalta (60mg once-daily).I take 20mg in the morning, and I have a lot more energy. Just cleaning the dishes doesn't seem like an exhausting burden anymore. My facial expressions and effect don't seem flat, zombie, stiff and mask like. I can process what I'm reading more clearly. I CARE more and FEEL more. I feel motivated, and more active, no longer just sitting and watching TV all day, letting the house turn into a pit. I'm being productive, I can keep many things at the front of my head without forgetting.

I've had to alter my dose at times and currently take 10mg twice a day.  I work part-time and try to alter my lifestyle so I won't need to up my dose too soon.

It helps significantly and without it, I don't think I would be able to work or function. However, my dosage has needed to be increased as it seems my body is getting used to it.

The drug is very effective and I have not become addicted in anyway although I have developed a tolerance to the medication and have had to increase my dosage to now the highest amount available and now will most likely have to change to another medication.  The side effects have also increased including mood swings and and feelings of depression when the drug wears off and now I am convinced that it is time to switch medications.  Even with these increased side effects, without this drug I wouldn't have been able to function as a normal human being and I am now nervous that I won't be able to find another medication that was this effective.",Anonymous
