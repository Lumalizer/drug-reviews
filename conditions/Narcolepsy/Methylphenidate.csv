From day  1 the continual tiredness and falling asleep has stopped, I am able to concentrate and focus at work for prolonged periods of time, where as before I would take a break wash my face every 30 minutes to try to avoid feeling sleepy.Now I am sleeping better ( using CPAP machine) and awake as normal during the day…really happy with the results….Also so far I have had no side effects other than on day 3 my vision was a bit weird for about an hour then returned to normal….Overall a positive experience",Amir

4,Methylphenidate,Narcolepsy,3.0,,"February 21, 2021",0,"Concerta (methylphenidate):I took this medication along with another narcolepsy medication for about 3 months. At first, I was taking Armodafinil 250mg and Concerta 36mg ER every morning. I became extremely anxious and paranoid about irrational things. I also became very OCD as well, which is not normal for me. After explaining that to my doctor, I ended up reducing Armodafinil to 150mg and continued the Concerta 36mg ER. I did this for about a month but I didn’t feel like the medication was benefiting me enough to continue taking it. I also had dry mouth when on the medication and I was physically unable to yell. My mouth and throat felt like sandpaper. Personally I didn’t think the meds were helping me enough with attention span and alertness. I quit Concerta 36mg ER and went back to just taking Armodafinil 250mg. I have been focusing a lot on my diet and exercise which I felt has made a huge difference. Also prioritizing my mental health.

It turned out I had Narcolepsy without cataplexy after a full night time study and MSLT. At first I was taking 10mg of Ritalin 2x a day, that wasn't working so she switched me to 10mg of Ritalin 4x daily. I was finding that I'd get terrible headaches from it so she tried me on Provigil 200mg. That alone wasn't working as your body adjusts to it. I started supplementing with 10mg of Ritalin 1x a day. That also wasn't working. I now take Provigil 200mg at 5am and supplement that with 20mg of Ritalin at noon and move on to another 10mg of Ritalin around 4pm and I'm getting through my 12 hour work days, plus still have energy when I get home!

My doctor prescribed Adderall XR which was great for a while until I needed higher dosages to function but the side effects weren't worth taking the med. So I stopped all stimulants.

I've been to multiple doctors and they pushed aside this symptom. I was almost in tears when my neurologist prescribed Ritalin. Day 3: improved concentration AND more energy!. So far so good. I was worried I would have problems because of my heart conditions but it is anatomic and not rhythmic so I'm okay! He also assured this will help with weight loss which is great!

18,Methylphenidate,Narcolepsy,7.0,,"May 5, 2018",4,I was diagnosed with narcolepsy about 5 years ago. I use quotations because my sleep specialist said he couldn’t give me an official diagnosis because I was on an SNRI and that I needed to be off that to be diagnosed officially. But he said he had no doubt. He surprisingly prescribed nothing. My psychiatrist prescribed me 27mg of Concerta for my chronic fatigue (to put it lightly) and life changed. I didn’t have to spend my entire days laying down or rushing home to take a nap. I’m awake to spend more time with my children and I feel more energized to do the things that my mind wants to do but my body wouldn’t allow. The only gripe I have is that I still feel the need to take a short nap every day but Concerta keeps my mind too active to relax. Then my anxiety about sleep kicks in and keeps me from taking that much needed nap. So I do spend some time very tired but very wired.,DaniHM

And I do worry sometime does it overload my brain and in long term would that end up making more problems down the road?

Literally the first day I started taking this medication, I could stay awake in all of my classes and I felt the passion and love for learning I always had as a kid. For the past years, watching Netflix was the go-to rather than homework just because I couldn't muster the physical nor mental energy to follow through.

I've been on Ritalin and 2 different non narcotic medicines and they simply stopped being effective after a short period of time.

I used the equivalent of a 90 days prescription (one 20 mg once a day) for 3 months. I did not use the pill every day due to illnesses and migraines. Who wants to be alert for that? When I did take it, it was a different life for me. I could actually plan what task I would complete that day instead of ""watch and wait"" as it has always been for me with narcolepsy. I am a stay at home mom with a 3 year old and a 14 year old. In result my house was cleaner, I was more predictable energy wise. I did sleep lighter and occasionally woke up at night. It was not bothersome though, not to stop it. Then the unfortunate happened, I became allergic to it ( I am also allergic to Nuvigil  and Progvigl).",narcoleptic in houston

The drug is very effective and I have not become addicted in anyway although I have developed a tolerance to the medication and have had to increase my dosage to now the highest amount available and now will most likely have to change to another medication.  The side effects have also increased including mood swings and and feelings of depression when the drug wears off and now I am convinced that it is time to switch medications.  Even with these increased side effects, without this drug I wouldn't have been able to function as a normal human being and I am now nervous that I won't be able to find another medication that was this effective.",Anonymous

The only thing about the Ritalin is that you get a slight rush and then it seems to wear off before it should. My dosage was doubled and that seemed to work out a lot better.
