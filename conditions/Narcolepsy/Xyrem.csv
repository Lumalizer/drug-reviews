0,Xyrem,Narcolepsy,8.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"March 2, 2022",1,"I’ve been on a single nightly dose for a little longer than a week and was sooooo happy to feel normal. I take it at 11pm -12am and wake up 6:30am 8:30am without an alarm.  Excessive drowsiness greatly reduced. Side effects were feeling hot and a burning, aching feeling in legs. I was willing to live with that in exchange for being able to clean my kitchen and vacuum in the same day.  But 2 nights ago within minutes of taking dose, on an empty stomach, I started feeling very nauseous and belching. Last night after about 20 minutes I spontaneously vomited 3x and then only slept 4.5 hours.  Why would this start after a week?   I’m devastated.  Has anyone else experienced this? Does it stop?",MrsH
1,Xyrem,Narcolepsy,9.0,,"October 12, 2021",1,"I admit, I was greedy to feel better and not well-informed about the process of titration when I began this med; I followed the titration schedule but kept increasing dosage even when my EDS improved and I noticed my anxiety was heightened. After my first night at 4.0x2, I had a full-on anxiety attack. Reduced dosage to 2.25x2, another anxiety attack. I had to go off Xyrem for a painful month while getting on 10 mg/day of Buspirone, a non-sedating anxiolytic. Talked a lot with my sleep doctor, psychiatrist, and the pharmacists at ESSDS. Now I only take one dose of 3.0 when I wake up (on my own or to the alarm) in the middle of the night, between 2.30-3.30am. I'm completely off the Ritalin I relied on to stay alert/awake. So grateful I found a dosage level that doesn't cause debilitating anxiety and wish I'd known to take more care through the titration process, stopping when my EDS was affected, not because the Rx notes on the bottle say to keep increasing.",Anonymous
2,Xyrem,Narcolepsy,,Taken for less than 1 month,"October 1, 2021",2,"I was so hopeful that this med was going to fix me. The taste I read was awful but it wasn't too bad. Tasted like ocean water. I take psych drugs that are sedating and muscle relaxers and opioids which had to be spread out 6 hours before taking Xyrem. That means ALL my sedating drugs have to be taken by 3 pm which kind of sucks.  Took the first 2.25 dose at 9 pm..took a half hour to kick in. Fell asleep. Up by 11. Dang. I read you can take second dose 2.5-4 hours after first. So at 11:30 took 2nd dose. Half hour wait again. 1am rolls around, I'm WIDE AWAKE. I understand it takes some ppl time to titrate up and with the low doses it can be frustrating. But then around 3am I had 2 panic attacks, full body flushing, heart racing, severe impending doom feeling. The anxiety lingered throughout the next day. I tried it again on might 2 and the SAME things happened like clockwork. My Dr advised me to come off and said I must not tolerate the drug due to the anxiety. *Crying** back to square o",Bsmom
3,Xyrem,Narcolepsy,7.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"January 28, 2021",3,"I have narcolepsy type 1 (w/ cataplexy). I believe my case is fairly mild, as I've not experienced the hallucinations and I've never fallen asleep in the middle of talking or walking. I've been taking Xyrem for three weeks. The higher doses are definitely more effective than the lower. I don't feel more awake during the day yet, but I am sleeping solidly at night, no more waking up every 45 minutes and less dreaming before I get to sleep. I'm still experiencing small cataplectic attacks, but I've seen where those aren't really impacted until you get to 9g a night. On the downside, if I wake up before the dose has run its course, I'll be buzzed or stone drunk and dizzy. I'm encouraged by other folks saying that those symptoms dissipate over time. So far, par for the course and sleeping well.",Tentatively Hopeful
4,Xyrem,Narcolepsy,9.0,Taken for 5 to 10 years,"July 18, 2020",12,"I tried ritalin, adderall, adderall XR, but nothing worked very well for my narcolepsy. During the day, I always felt that I could fall asleep within 5-10 minutes if I wanted to no matter what was going on. I switched doctors and the new doctor prescribed Xyrem. For me, it has been life-changing! I can read books for hours without getting drowsy, which never was the case previously. The only issue is taking a dose in the middle of the night, as sometimes I can sleep through the alarm. I then have to reduce the size of the dose so I can get up when my 2nd alarm goes off. It works well-try it!",Brother2
5,Xyrem,Narcolepsy,10.0,,"June 5, 2020",9,"Xyrem was more of a last resort drug for me, as it's not approved for the use in IH (Idiopathic Hypersomnia) and also the fact that I'm being treated for anxiety and bipolar II. Modafinil and Vyvanse helped me at least stay awake for a good chunk of the day, but actually waking up was basically impossible. I could set an alarm at 8am and snooze through all the alarms. My brain was literally craving for me to stay sleeping, it was horrible. With Xyrem, even if I still feel sleepy enough to fall asleep after my alarm goes off, I still hear the next one go off and not have that desperate need to go back to sleep. It caused me to be able to lower my stimulant doses. I'm going up 0.25g every 2 weeks until I hit 9g total. The higher the dose the more refreshed I feel. Side effects for me was muscle twitching in my arms and legs, which did go away when I started increasing my potassium intake and take magnesium twice a day to balance my electrolytes, since Xtrem is literally drinking sodium--and a lot of it!",SleepyDude
6,Xyrem,Narcolepsy,8.0,,"April 29, 2020",18,"Xyrem has changed my life, but not without side effects. Prior to starting this medication, I was exhausted all the time. So exhausted I felt drunk. I was also getting vivid hallucinations at night, sleep paralysis, & nightmares. I never felt rested, no matter how much I slept. Since starting this medication, I actually wake up feeling like I got a good night’s sleep. I have energy for the first time in 12 years and feel normal for once. Now for the drawbacks. I have found that the high sodium throws off my magnesium & potassium. This causes severe muscle cramps & chest pain. I have been able to combat this by drinking a ton of water, exercising (sweating out as much if Xyrem as I can), & taking an OTC potassium & magnesium supplement. For context, I also have POTS so the high salt has actually helped w/that. Overall, this medication is worth the extra steps I have to take to get rid of the side effects. I feel the best I’ve felt in years.",Morgan
7,Xyrem,Narcolepsy,6.0,,"April 24, 2020",8,"I’ve been in xyrem for 3 years. It worked a little better in the first year but my body got used to it. It works well only if I take it on empty stomach after fasting for 48 hours. It is only on these occasions that I get enough sleep and wake up refreshed but then my body retaliate and when I go back to take it 3-4 hours after dinner, I get to sleep just 2 hrs with the first dose and maybe 3 hrs with the second dose and wake up very tired. I tried skipping dinner and stop eating at 2 PM and again, it worked in the beginning but then my body adjusted. I guess I’ll just continue to struggle being tired during the day.

Hit or miss some nights work others don’t. After 1st dose 3 hours sleep and 2nd dose lucky to get 2 hours. My 15 yo son has narcolepsy too. A little more sleep than me but hard to get him up. He is still tired during the day as well. I have a new Med called Sunosi if I need it during the day but my heart races too fast. I’m going to try not eating 3 hours before bed as some have said. Xyrem also works better the colder it is so going to try an ice pack in lunch box next to bed for 2nd dose. Weird dreams after waking after 2 hours on 2nd dose.

The pedi neuro sleep specialist had him start on a dose of 2.25 which was WAY too high and made him completely incapacitated and violently ill. We joined the a  Xyrem support group and started over at 1.25. We titrated up slowly in .25 increments until we got to 3 ml twice a night--at that point he was sleeping 4 hrs per dose. Any more led to him vomiting. Jazz Pharma rec's everyone be on a 4.5x2 maintenance dose which is insane. We have great results on 3mlx2--he sleeps, doesn't nap at all during the day and needs no stimulants. He has increased anxiety, but Lexapro helps with that as well as preventing his C.

I diagnosed with would like to thank my doctor.  I was reading reviews of local psychiatrists, and his reviews made him out to be a pompous individual.  I do not know about you, but a confident, know-it-all doctor would be a change for me.

(Literally) the second most important is that if you're feeling uncomfortable with this drug, hang in there, it will pass. I’m one month past my one year anniversary with this agent. Firstly I want to recollect back to when I began it. The first week was a struggle, I felt as through I had been tranquilized, my back hurt really bad, I was slowed and dizzy. The third week was better. The really great effects (of falling to sleep quickly and waking up pleasantly stimulated) began 4-5 months after starting the medication. IT works great for ADHD, Daytime Sleepiness, and Fibromyalgia.  Side effects: Ditziness, tenseness in the muscles, blush face, increased libido, munchies.",PRIUSHAPPY (and tense)

Despite a clear diagnoses and despite struggling with this disorder for close to 37 years (first symptoms appeared when I was 5 years old in form of hypnagogic hallucinations and cataplexy) I was resisting my doctors recommend course of action which included first and foremost the use of Xyrem. I had like everyone else  visited forums and was very concerned about the lack of success stories and of course the possible side effects. By the beginning of 2015 I came to the realization that I had not only completely exhausted myself but also all alternative routes of fighting my narcolepsy and therefore decided to try Xyrem. I was very nervous and the first few nights and days were difficult and fairly unpleasant as my body didn't appreciate the sodium oxybate. Both my doctor and the central pharmacy were very helpfully, but in the end it is oneself who has to get through it. After 5 days I started to experience what I most of the world would call proper sleep. I go to bed and take me dose and after 15 minutes fall asleep. 2-3 hours later I wake up by myself and take the second dose. Normally I wake a few minutes before the alarm goes off and I manage to get through the day without coffee (impossible a few month ago) and only 200mg of Modafinil. The night is no longer a continues row of dreams, but passes in the blink of an eye. There are a few rules that I feel are key to success. Don't eat 3 hours before going to bed.Don't drink anything put small amounts of water.Stay away from coffee after lunch.Stay away from chocolate and sweets after 5pm.Keep a diary of your progress or get yourself a Jawbone, Fitbit or some other tracking devise. And finally, go out and tell people of your success and visit a forum and leave feedback even when you don't have the time, because other people need to know that there are success stories.",Now I sleep
