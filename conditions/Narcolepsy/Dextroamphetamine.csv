1,Dextroamphetamine,Narcolepsy,5.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"December 23, 2021",1,I can’t take two or three 5mg and end up sleeping the entire day away with no issue! Very disappointed. If anything it just gets my heart rate going wicked fast.,Doesn't matter
2,Dextroamphetamine,Narcolepsy,10.0,Taken for 10 years or more,"November 20, 2021",3,Dexedrine (dextroamphetamine):After diagnosis I was prescribed a few other medications with no success until Dexedrine. At first I was prescribed the slow release tablets however they conflicted with my schedule. I've been on Dexedrine  for 25 years & have only increased my dosage once - from 40 mg to 45 mg. I have no doubts correct diagnosis & a good doctor literally saved my life,queenbeecanadas
3,Dextroamphetamine,Narcolepsy,9.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"August 8, 2021",12,"Zenzedi (dextroamphetamine):I’ve tried sooooo many medications for my narcolepsy with cataplexy and extreme EDS! Nuvigil and Provigil do not work for me. Focalin made me extremely angry and anxious. Ritalin just quit working. Vyvanse did nothing. Sunosi did even less. Adderall worked great but I have a wheat intolerance and the generic I was using caused a major flare up for me. And the list could continue…I discovered Zenzedi and asked my sleep doc about it. She hadn’t heard of it but we gave it a try. After almost two years, I’ve only had to increase my dose once (from 20mg twice daily to 25mg twice daily). This stuff is magical for me. It keeps me awake with very few side effects and no crash. I take my doses about 5-6 hours apart. I’ve always been a runner but this medication and a pandemic have allowed me to run virtually everyday which I believe also helps my EDS. I cannot take the generic version.",Narcolepsygirl
4,Dextroamphetamine,Narcolepsy,9.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"March 20, 2021",1,"Hi I am taking dex for narcolepsy to keep me awake and I’ve noticed that I am almost constantly in the mood. When I wake up, when I’m going to bed, wow even if I’m eating lunch. I’ve also noticed, I’ve been a lot more wet lately too. It’s not something I’m exactly used to but it’s also not a bad thing.I was wondering if it had anything to do with my medication and it seems so. The problem I’ve run into is the fact that my partner isn’t in the mood as often as I am and I wasn’t sure how to approach him about this subject.",Anonymous
5,Dextroamphetamine,Narcolepsy,,Taken for 10 years or more,"January 13, 2021",18,"Dexedrine (dextroamphetamine):Have been taking Dexadrine from the days of SKF, and before. Now in my seventies a different pharmacist gave me a generic version from Activa co. which was seem to have no proper drug in it. I mostly felt cheated because there was no helpful effect. I felt lousy and slept away 3 months of my life having no energy I could not function normally as before. I called my pharmacist to report the medication was not working and the spansules weren't even the same colour or size. He said they are cheaper brand. I told him I don't mind paying more for the proper medication I have taken daily for more than 50 years. I refuse to be abused in this way, and  will take my next script back to my previous family pharmacist.",Pops
6,Dextroamphetamine,Narcolepsy,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"December 6, 2020",6,"I’m healthy and fit - 28 years old male. Had a very bad mental breakdown. This gave me anxiety, panic attacks and depression. Unfortunately it also gave me EDS (excessive daytime sleepiness.) During the day, I yawn like crazy, I can just about crash anywhere. (Armodafinil, modafinil) never worked for me. My new psychiatrist prescribed me dexamphetamine 5mg instant release.I take 5mg when I wake up, 5mg after lunch and 5mg after dinner.This drug makes me feel like was when I was a kid - happy, laughter, fun, plenty of energy, feel heaps stronger and heaps of confidence. Time flies.Best drug I’ve ever had.Best part (apart from no withdrawals and the only side effect is dry mouth) is that 100 pills only cost $9.99 AUD.If the whole world was on this drug, it would be a much happier place.",Australia
7,Dextroamphetamine,Narcolepsy,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"April 30, 2020",14,"Dexedrine (dextroamphetamine):I have never had a worse experience on a medication. After having limited success on modafinil, armodafinil, sunosi, and adderall, my doctor prescribed me this Dexedrine dose at 10 mg and it is terrible. I go two- three day stretches without sleeping, have had the most debilitating anxiety of my entire life, and feel like I am going insane. Yes I’m staying awake but it has been the worst time of my entire life.",Dog
8,Dextroamphetamine,Narcolepsy,10.0,,"February 2, 2020",33,"Dexedrine (dextroamphetamine):I was diagnosed with narcolepsy at the age of eight I was taking a 5 mg tablets that handled my situation.  I was able to be an outgoing loving child.  My body was  managing medication without falling asleep at inappropriate times.  I am now over 70 now taking 15 mg span  One twice a day. I am able to function and maintain a high profile professional position. The very worst part of this medication is the price. My parents were paying $5.00 for my medication. After marriage I was paying $15 co-pay then went to $35 co-pay and now it’s$144. I think this is totally unfair and a  ridiculous charge for this drug. However I don’t have a choice because it works. I have taken other medication That caused hallucinate ,unable to drive, heart palpitations and feeling like I was on a high all the time however Dexedrine does not create a problem  not in the slightest. I do not experience dry mouth, jitters, Hallucination or heart palpitation or any side effects with Dexedrine",Ginny

11,Dextroamphetamine,Narcolepsy,10.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"January 13, 2019",51,"Zenzedi (dextroamphetamine):I have Narcolepsy without Cataplexy with extreme EDS and ADHD--the double whammy. Modafinil helped but not enough--very unpredictable-- and, of course, did nothing for the ADHD. Vyvanse gave me GI trouble and I still had sleep attacks plus a terrible ""crash"". Adderall was the worst, as it gave me a paradoxical effect: I was even more lethargic on Adderall, also irritable! I wasn't expecting much better when I tried Zenzedi but it has helped my narcolepsy greatly and also helps my ADHD with no side effects or crash like Vyvanse. Great medication, I just wish it was easier to find. CVS and Walgreen's couldn't even order it for me, said their wholesaler didn't carry it (???).",ICouldSleepAllDay

Dexadrine has been much more tolerated for me than ritalin or adderall. Ritalin has less tension confusion actions and decisions ER Dexadrine is far best but not as good as nuvigil,KSound
13,Dextroamphetamine,Narcolepsy,10.0,,"December 31, 2017",7,I have been taking it for over 34 years and am on 10 mg tabs 3 times a day. It works well for me with almost no side affects. Started on Ritalin  and it did not work well for me. Also tried Modafanil it was too weak. Don't give up trying to treat your symptoms as doctors don't want to give amphetamines to you.,jack in houston
14,Dextroamphetamine,Narcolepsy,10.0,,"April 16, 2017",12,"I have been taking Dextroamphetamines and/or Dexadrine since 1993 when I was first diagnosed with narcolepsy. The main side effect for me Is dry mouth and talking to much. If I take the medicine within 8 hours of bedtime, I may have slight problems going to sleep because I'm still thinking too much. Other than that, I'm as far away from insomnia as I can be. I have done 2 sleep studies while taking this medicine and I still go to stage 4 sleep in less than a minute, at will. Before this medicine, I was never able to drive more than 30 minutes, I couldn't go out to peoples homes, or watch TV, or go to the movies. Even when I played in a rock band I was falling asleep during practice. This is a miracle drug for me.",Jon Won
15,Dextroamphetamine,Narcolepsy,10.0,,"September 18, 2015",25,I was diagnosed with narcolepsy in my late 20's. Today I am 74 years young.  When first diagnosed I was giving Ritalin.  After a couple years that switched me to Dexedrine tablets.  In my early 40's I was switched to Dextroamphetamine time released capsules of 15 milligram 3 a day.  This medicine has made my life very manageable.  Best treatment for narcolepsy.  The cost is my only problem..,Punky Gipe
16,Dextroamphetamine,Narcolepsy,8.0,,"September 7, 2015",142,"Dexedrine (dextroamphetamine):I am 63 years old.  Feel as if I have lost out on many years of living. Always had mental health issues.  I managed to work for twenty-five years, off and on.  Never was able to articulate my physical and emotional well being very well to a doctor.  I was just handed an antidepressant and a sleeping pill. I gave up trying to find an answer to my severe fatigue, insomnia and deep depressions. I would beat myself up, since there has never been any reason, I could pin point as to why I suffered so much.  I feel I have slept my life away. Now I am finally HOPEFUL. On low dose dex for one week. I slept a full 8 hours and have a positive feeling of a wonderful 25 years to come!  Thanks for all the comments, which have given me a renewed strength!",Finally hopeful
17,Dextroamphetamine,Narcolepsy,10.0,Taken for 10 years or more,"August 14, 2015",54,"Dexedrine (dextroamphetamine):I've been taking dexedrine spansules 15 mg 2 pills at a time, 2-3 times a day for about 30 years for narcolepsy.  I'm currently 57 years old.  If it weren't for this Rx i would probably never leave my house.   Through the years i have tried various alternative meds only to find they don't work as well.  Among the alternatives tried are Adderall (made me actuallyy violent); Provigil (absolutely ineffective); and Nuvigil was worse than ineffective...because it gave me the sensation of being high. So i thought it was working and i got behind the wheel of a car...bad idea.  Changed back asap.  Been on the same dosage for 20 yrs.  Side effects:  for 10 min every day get bad dry mouth and anxious.  Cost is prohibitive.",elegalone
18,Dextroamphetamine,Narcolepsy,10.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"April 7, 2015",46,Dexedrine (dextroamphetamine):Dexedrine was very helpful in treating my narcolepsy. It is dependable without making me nervous. I am able to have a better attention span too! I can sit confidentiality at my desk or be in social situations and have confidence that I will not be falling asleep while someone is talking to me again!

19,Dextroamphetamine,Narcolepsy,10.0,,"December 30, 2014",54,"Dexedrine (dextroamphetamine):I was diagnosed with narcolepsy at 18 years old, I have been taking Dexedrine for a little over a year now. I recommend using Dexedrine because it does a great job of keeping you awake without the nasty side effects that other medicines bring, like Adderall. Dexedrine has really changed my life, I am able to confidently drive and good at work without having to worry about falling asleep. I really wish I had this in High School. For all the younger people out there with narcolepsy ask your doctor to put you on Dexedrine, it's less expensive than Adderall and Vyvanse (Vyvanse didn't work for me I fell asleep several times on it). The side effects I find with it is sometimes it gives me mood swings, most of the time its a feeling of optimism.",Seigfred
20,Dextroamphetamine,Narcolepsy,8.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"December 5, 2014",48,"Dexedrine (dextroamphetamine):Along with narcolepsy, I've also been diagnosed with ADHD. I have been taking dexedrine for the last 4 years. At first it was 5mg tablets which worked for a couple months. As soon as my dose was increased to 10mg spansules a day, my life has been so much easier since then. I can actually concentrate on one thing without wanting to quit in the middle and take a nap. Many side effects including dry mouth almost every day, heart pounding, loss of appetite leading to weight loss, muscles twitching, and severe tiredness if I suddenly stop taking it.",Sleepingstar
21,Dextroamphetamine,Narcolepsy,10.0,,"July 19, 2014",120,"Dexedrine (dextroamphetamine):Hopefully my experience will give some with Narcolepsy a little bit of relief taking this medicine.  I started taking Dexedrine when I was 31 years old and 100 tablets of Dexedrine cost $5.  I am now 71 years old and have been taking this for 40 years and I am still alive without any bad side effects that I am aware of.  After taking Dexedrine, I finished nursing school and became an RN.  Since that time I have retired.  As a teenager in high school, I thought that studying was going to my bed with a book and falling asleep.  If it wasn't for a clerical course, I would have never graduated as I couldn't fall asleep typing or taking shorthand.  I was amazed how Dexedrine helped me. My does is 2 10 mg tablets 3 times a day.",Watchilla
22,Dextroamphetamine,Narcolepsy,10.0,,"February 2, 2014",24,"I had a motor vehicle accident when I was 21, I am now 39 and have been on Dexedrine 9 months.This has been a saviour for my life in many aspects.  I have never been able to read a book.  Either, I would lose interest on the first line or lose attentiveness because of my sleeping disorder.I lived with this problem for almost 20 years. I never knew anything different, simply because I've never been one to hang around large crowds to compare other female lifestyles my age, plus became a young mother at 21.My parents never said anything to me.  They just let me have my 2 hr nap daily to rejuvenate myself.The other positive that Dexedrine has given me is the confidence to really pursue a career of becoming a Dentist.  ",Daniellemet

If I have a specific goal I can get up, otherwise in bed for 15 hours. After two weeks of 15 mg dextroamphetamine in the morning. I have begun to get a life back.

24,Dextroamphetamine,Narcolepsy,10.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"October 9, 2012",29,"I fall between fatigue and narcolepsy.  Things like falling aslleep at traffic lights, work and at home.  The doctor thought it might be the side effect of sleep apnea, so I took the test and ended up very low (6x per hour).  I was put on Provigil which I soon fell asleep on, then on to Nuvigil, which wasn't strong enough.  Ritalin was next but it gave a big crash when it ebbed.  Now I am on dextroamphetamine and it is helping immensley.  No more falling asleep in the car or at work and at home (which was putting a strain on my marrage.)",Sojrn
25,Dextroamphetamine,Narcolepsy,10.0,,"April 23, 2012",63,Dexedrine (dextroamphetamine):I have been taking one 10 mg spansule and one 5 mg tablet in the morning and same dose at lunchtime for over ten years (since I was diagnosed with Narcolepsy). It has been a life saver for me.  Keeps me alert while driving. I was told by several Doctors over the years to STOP taking it because I would need more and more of it as time went on. My dose has always been the same and I sometimes don't take all of that. My neurologist has recently started me on Nuvigil and since that may work by itself I have decided to taper myself off the Dexedrine to see if the Nuvigil may be all I need. So far no problems. I agree with comment that Dexedrine has an un-deserved bad rep. ,VintageBeachgirl

Days when I don't work or drive I often don't take any. Otherwise, if I know I don't have a meeting or have to grade papers in the evening, I just take in the morning and at noon. (60 mg) This was much better for me than the time release variety which always kept me awake throughout the night.",Anonymous

I currently take 90mg daily - both the 5mg tabs and the 15mg spansules.  I require two 20mins naps/day, but will still have sleep attacks if I'm inactive.  It may not sound overly great but without Dexedrine I'd never leave my bed/couch, as I fall asleep every 10 mins. So essentially, it does a world of difference.",riL0

This drug is good for me. The dose would be high for some, but I am around 200 lbs and 6' 3"", so I need a moderately high dose based on body weight alone.
