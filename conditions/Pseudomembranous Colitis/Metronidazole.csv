1,Metronidazole,Pseudomembranous Colitis,2.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"August 25, 2019",1,Was having very mild colitis symptoms and was prescribed for 12 days. Overall made me severely nauseous in the last three days killed my appetite to the point I lost 5 pounds was told the only other medication I could take was 1000 dollars. Probably going to lose my job because the nausea is so bad I can’t get out of bed. Spent most of yesterday throwing up so I couldn’t hold down my dosage. I feel very cloudy headed and it’s so intense I am not able to take my other daily medications that I need to stay emotionally regular. Honestly my diarrhea got worse after taking it becoming an everyday occurrence while on the medicine. I have been prescribed two additional medications just because of the side effects. Safe to say I’m going to start telling doctors I’m allergic to this medicine because it is affecting my life in so many ways that I just cannot condone.,Noracat
2,Metronidazole,Pseudomembranous Colitis,3.0,,"January 14, 2017",1,Pill sticks in throat everytime. horrible medication.,Colitis279
3,Metronidazole,Pseudomembranous Colitis,8.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"July 3, 2015",4,symptoms started as going #2 bathroom over 5-10 times a day. I got flagyl/metronidazole 500mg. It generally works for intestinal bacterial infection. You take 1 tablet by mouth 3 times a day for 7 days. Manufactures please make capsule form. The tablet TASTES really BAD. Take it with soda/gatorade or something that can wash away aftertaste. The side effects I felt were; nausea and dizziness. My Doctor said drink a lot of water and have it during meals and avoid all alcohol including certain mouthwash and anything that contains alcohol.,alex.p
4,Metronidazole,Pseudomembranous Colitis,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"January 23, 2014",5,"I came back from Cuba with a sinus infection about two weeks ago.. my doctor prescribed an antibiotic that I normally used in the past, long story short I got a very nasty case of Diarrhea after the 4th day.  Started going to the bathroom over 7 times a day (i literally lost count).. Went to the walk-in clinic again and they said that it could be due to C.difficile and asked me to do a stool test..  said i should book an appointment in 10 days when the results got back..   I waited two days and broke.. went back to them and said there is no point in waiting as all i did all day was go to the bathroom. Needless to say after one metronidazole pill it did the trick. Hallelujah!  Best 15 dollars I ever spent!!  I am going to pass out candy boxes today.",Pickyourdestiny
