0,Octreotide,Pituitary Adenoma,8.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"April 8, 2019",1,"My pituitary adenoma was growing despite use of cabergoline.  My endocrinologist suggested octreotide LAR. My tumor has decreased in size, prolactin levels have also decreased.  I did experience gall bladder and GI issues.  But the benefits are worth the side effects.",LillyD
1,Octreotide,Pituitary Adenoma,,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"March 6, 2014",0,"I was on this once a month before surgery, I found that overall I felt better. Didn't have the withdrawal that you can get on some medicines when it's close to time for the next dosage, but felt better after.The needle is very scary, but you really don't notice it being different from other shots.Very expensive.",akbraun
