0,Amantadine,Fatigue,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"February 2, 2020",18,"Two weeks ago, I began Amantadine for extreme fatigue from MS. Initially, pain increased all over, but it was explained to me that that was most likely from a return to moderate activity. I continued treatment and have noticed a marked improvement of cognitive functioning, ability to maintain focus and recall events with more ease. Social interactions are improved. Physically, I have been able to cook and do housework as I desire instead of being too tired. Pain is manageable with current regimen. I am cautiously optimistic that this level of energy may continue and my quality of life may be greatly improved.",Msfatigue
