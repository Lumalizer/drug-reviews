1,Methylphenidate,Fatigue,3.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"April 27, 2020",3,"My history is that I have a Traumatic Brain Injury from Intraventricular Hemorrhage.  I was prescribed methylphenidate ER and the the third day I took it, I was so itchy and I had red patches all over my body. Ever since the TBI, I frequently react to medication. The manufacturer of the generic I took is Camber, and I read that it is divided into 3 layers and one later is a sponge that expands in the stomach, and the coating has methylphenidate IR and then there is a thin coating of plastic over the layers that are in tablet form. I wonder if my reaction was to the sponge-like mechanism or methylphenidate itself. As far as helping me focus, I would give it a C-. (the information I read about the medication may not be accurate, ask your doctor or call your pharmacist for further information)",Emily1456
2,Methylphenidate,Fatigue,10.0,Taken for 5 to 10 years,"October 12, 2019",13,"I take this medicine methylphenidate every morning. It's helping me stay awake during the day, and I love it!",Meag
3,Methylphenidate,Fatigue,,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"August 17, 2019",29,"I tried methylphenidate for chronic fatigue syndrome--basically, feeling extremely tired almost all the time, lacking alertness and energy. I've taken it off and on for 2 years. Initially, for about 6 months, it worked very well. I felt a lot of energy, physically, socially and mentally, the only side effect being that I could get too hyped, feeling an artificial, driven type of energy. After 6 months or so it became less effective, often leaving me feeling agitated and not able to focus very well. Unfortunately, after stopping it I reverted to feeling exhausted. After a few days of exhaustion, though, I can't stand it and resume taking it, with a similar pattern, i.e., it works well for a few days and then leaves me agitated. I'm planning to go to a clinic that specializes in CFS and may also try a physician that also specializes in CFS",Jake
4,Methylphenidate,Fatigue,9.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"August 19, 2017",25,"I got prescribed ritalin ir 5 mg for depression caused by fatigue (worsened by chemo). At first, I thought taking a pill whenever I was depressed or fatigued would be awesome, but it sucks. All it turns into is a schedule, and taking a pill 3 times a day on an empty stomach becomes difficult. When it worked, it worked well, but the crash was terrible. Even when it was working, I couldn't even enjoy watching tv. It was horrible.Then, I was prescribed 20 mg of the slow release, which was much better. It lasts pretty much all day, there's no crash, and it gives me a little more energy to do things. It does decrease my appetite, but it's worth it. It does make it a little difficult to go to sleep on time, but it makes waking up early very easy",michdavidadams
5,Methylphenidate,Fatigue,9.0,,"May 2, 2017",23,"After 3 years of success with Wellbutrin, it finally pooped out on me. Unfortunately, as a result of this, my energy levels dropped immediately to the point where I could barely get out of bed. I had blood work done, but nothing was found that would explain the fatigue, like vitamin deficiency or thyroid issues. No problems with sleep either.So my dr prescribed 18 mg of concerta and it's been pretty close to a miracle. I can actually get up in the morning again. I feel like I did when I first started Wellbutrin. One issue is that after ~2 months on 18mg, I can feel myself not responding to the drug as well as I did initially. Part of this might just be my imagination, but I know that this is common with stimulants.",SallyWally
6,Methylphenidate,Fatigue,4.0,Taken for 10 years or more,"September 1, 2016",12,"I was started on Methylphenidate as a teenager due to fatigue and ADD. Not ADHD. For a long time, I found that it helped, I could stay focused, my mood was better...until I was into my 30's...I was put back on it and a year or two later, I was switched to Adderall, then back to Methylphenidate. I began to feel very emotional, crying out of nowhere, everything seemed amplified and my anxiety was through the roof! My behavior was reckless, it was a nightmare! I went from a stable single mom, to an emotional wreck, on a downward spiral. My doctor took me off of it, immediately. Once off of it, all of that stopped. Its definitely a drug to be careful with.",GlitterAnxietyWater
7,Methylphenidate,Fatigue,3.0,,"August 20, 2016",30,"Prescribed to give me more energy. Haven't been on it but for a few days, but all I want to do is sleep! I had more pep before I started taking it!",Anonymous

9,Methylphenidate,Fatigue,7.0,,"November 10, 2011",45,"Concerta (methylphenidate):I was prescribed Concerta to offset the drowsiness from the Abilify I take in conjunction with Lexapro. I have suffered from major depression since I was about 19 and have been on every SSRI on the market as well as Wellbutrin to treat my depression, and nothing has helped me more than Concerta. I only take 18mg twice a day (I'm 34) and while the anti-depressants make me lethargic and were causing my work to suffer, the Concerta has been a real lifesaver. I've only been on it a few months and haven't really suffered from any negative side effects (haven't really lost any weight yet), and am planning on discussing discontinuing the Lexapro and Abilify with my psychiatrist since the Concerta has had such a positive impact on my depression.",Anonymous
10,Methylphenidate,Fatigue,8.0,,"November 6, 2011",62,"Works well, initially though I felt like the medicine gave a ""forced"" feeling of alertness - similar but not as bad as Provigil. It subsided completely after 72 hours and continues to work very well.I have MS (advanced, fast progressing) and without this I wouldn't be able to overcome the fatigue to get out of bed, my chair or move around. I can also stop using it without noticing any bad effects. As such, as my symptoms improve intermittently, I use less or none until it is needed again.  I don't see the ""addictive"" tendency in the use of this medication either like the medicine information mentions... there is no ""warm fuzzy feeling"" or altered mental state for me. I just get to where I can move my legs and arms better, and think more clearly.",M.S.L.
