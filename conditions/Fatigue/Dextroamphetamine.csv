0,Dextroamphetamine,Fatigue,6,Taken for less than 1 month,"November 9, 2021",4,"I was given a small script of 10mg Dextroamphetamine XR. As a trial, for the daily fatigue I feel taking Benzodiazezpines. I took 1 in the morning for a few days. I didn't continue to take it because it was too strong!I was a fully charged battery. I was cleaning places and tidying like crazy. It also made me feel really good, everything was so rewarding. I know drugs affect people differently but this is amphetamine.I couldn't sleep that night.No wonder people abuse this drug, it's basically pharmaceutical speed.I can see the benefit for Narcolepsy or something short term. But in the long term I can see using it, being a problem for me. (Tolerance, Dependence)This is a powerful drug and I would use extreme caution when taking it.Only take what is prescribed by a doctor. Please!",Not 4 Kids
1,Dextroamphetamine,Fatigue,8,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"November 5, 2021",5,"As per the last review, I’ve also suffered from CFS for 10 years. Unfortunately it was extremely difficult to find medical providers who believed my struggles & were willing to look outside the square! I was almost fully couch bound for 5 years which resulted in losing my self built successful business, my house & my independence! I’d been trialled on multiple useless medications which led to nothing but hideous side effects & no relief! Finally I found an empathetic doctor who understood my frustration & debilitating struggles & prescribed this stimulant! It has been an absolute game changer in terms of my cognitive functioning & has allowed me to get some quality of life back & the confidence to drive safely. Without this medication I think I would have probably given up. For anyone with persistent chronic fatigue issues this medication is absolutely worth trying! It’s not a cure but it has most certainly been life changing for myself",Anonymous
2,Dextroamphetamine,Fatigue,9,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"December 3, 2020",5,dextroamphetamine is a very effective stimulant. Pros include strong stimulation capable of combating severe fatigue. Cons include its short duration of action requiring re-dosing every 3-4hrs and mild tolerance over time. Use sparingly if possible to avoid the need for dose escalation. Stick to your prescribed dose and you’ll find it effective over the long-term.,Jay
3,Dextroamphetamine,Fatigue,9,,"July 30, 2020",9,"I have been on 5-15mg (max) of dextroamphetamine per day for 2 weeks now, an off-label treatment for depression/PTSD with excessive daytime sleepiness and inability to control impulsive behaviours. I have tried many SSRIs, SNRIs, as well as Lamotrigine and Quetiapine and been non-responsive or experienced intolerable side effects (most notably they would make me fatigued and literally suck the remaining life out of me, as well as completely ruin my sex drive). With the dextroamphetamine I have noticed a positive change in my motivation, concentration and energy levels which has lead to an overall improvement in my mood as I am able to participate in activities that I had previously lost interest in due to my depression. My work ethic is also better. The only downside is I suffer from occasional anxiety, which has worsened since starting the medication. I am going to see my psychiatrist again to see what I can do about that. Hopefully my experience will help anyone else with medication-resistant depression.",Lamby
4,Dextroamphetamine,Fatigue,1,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"June 30, 2020",12,"Have been using Aurobindo generic immediate release Dextroamphetamine sulfate 5mg tabs, 2 in am, for 10 months. Worked beautifully, more focus, more energy, more motivation to accomplish tasks. No noted side effects. Last refill June 2020, was a completely different experience. Seven days of early morning nightmares, no energy, fatigue, felt terrible. Reported to physician, pharmacist and to FDA. Looking for an independent lab to get this tested and find out what happened. Pharmacy tells me that the other manufacturers of this generic drug are on back order and not currently available in my region in the US. Quality of life has taken a huge hit without this medication.",Lynn
5,Dextroamphetamine,Fatigue,6,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"July 13, 2019",1,"After trying Modafinil and Armodafinil with no success, my neurologist suggested trying a stimulant for MS relief fatigue. So far, the least I can say is I am a bit disappointed in this medicine (maybe it's because I'm using the generic form? idk) since I haven't experienced any improvement in my alertness or energy level. The comedowns were bad as well.",AnttiKokk

9,Dextroamphetamine,Fatigue,10,Taken for 10 years or more,"February 20, 2016",19,"I have used dextroamphetamine sulphate for many decades. Only 10 mg a day. It hasalways been the difference between (a) depression in the morning, anxiety during the dayand drinking at night and (b) confidence and energy in the morning, a little less in the afternoon and maybe a glass of wine at night. At this low dose, I experience no side effects. However, I frequently have trouble at next-Rx time.You have to have a doctor who will prescribe it and who knows what codes to include and sends prior authorization when required and a pharmacy that dispenses it, or one who has it in stock or will order it.",jipatib

11,Dextroamphetamine,Fatigue,7,Taken for less than 1 month,"November 3, 2013",28,"mostly positive, give me the little extra path I need my stuff in order to get my day going.I regret that my fatigue got to the point that I needed medical assistance in order to function as a regular person.",plan b
12,Dextroamphetamine,Fatigue,10,,"October 31, 2013",45,"I suffer from Chronic Fatigue Syndrome and have been taking this medicine for about 7 years now.  It gave me my life back.  I used to be so tired  that I couldn't get out of bed or participate in life.  The only problem is I have grown tolerant to it, and am at the maximum dosage, so I don't get as much energy from it as I used to.  But I couldn't function or live without it.",Beth14
