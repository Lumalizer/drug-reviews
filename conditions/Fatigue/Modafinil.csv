2,Modafinil,Fatigue,8.0,Taken for 10 years or more,"May 6, 2021",8,"I’ve taken Provigil/Modafinil over 20 years now for severe MS excessive daytime fatigue. Started on 50 mgs went up to 100 mgs and now I’ve been on 400mg a day (200 mg in am 200 mg afternoon), no side effects ever, The first * maybe* 5 years or a bit more were great! Now, I can sleep after taking it. I take a break each month for a week, sometimes two weeks but when I start back up again still just as fatigued. I tried switching to Ritalin and the other med prescribed for MS fatigue (off label) Ritalin made me narcoleptic, for real, I’d fall sound asleep w/out knowing it and the other did nothing so I’m back on Modafinil. I wish it worked liked it used to..hoping they approve Sunosi for off label use soon!.",Jude
3,Modafinil,Fatigue,9.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"April 1, 2021",13,"It really helps my exhaustion caused from MS. You have to find the right dosage that works for you; I discovered 50mg of Modafinal keeps me moving and accomplishing tasks all day—very productive. But, more than 100mg makes me too jittery. Also, I have to watch or even eliminate my caffeine intake when taking 50mg.",Dot
4,Modafinil,Fatigue,9.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"March 30, 2021",17,"I've been taking Modafinil 100mg daily for about 2 months now and it really helps me not feel tired during the day. I'm able to do more and feel the need to take naps and sleep 16 hours less. Before I take Modafinil in the morning, I feel quite tired and like I wanna go back to sleep for a long time, but once I take it, I'm better able to stay awake and more alert for longer periods of time. It usually wears off before I go to sleep too which is great and then I'm tired enough that I just fall right asleep at the end of the day",Kay

7,Modafinil,Fatigue,1.0,,"September 29, 2020",58,"I was prescribed Modafinil by my psychiatrist to help my chronic fatigue and depression (off-label). I am an addict in recovery (going on 9 months sober) and although this is not officially a stimulant, it toes the line *just enough* that it almost spun me into relapse. There's plenty of testimonials testifying how amazing this drug is and that it isn't addictive. I was more wakeful but the anxiety it gave me was not worth it the boost, plus I fantasized about upping my dose immediately. I ended up giving my medication to my boyfriend to throw away and having to tell my sobriety sponsor about it. I was on 100 mg, prescribed to take it every morning. I was on Modafinil for 2 months and quit cold turkey, and couldn't stay awake more than a couple hours for several days. I felt the need to post a review to warn anyone thinking their sobriety will stay in tact with this drug, because it almost threw me completely off the wagon.",funseizem

9,Modafinil,Fatigue,4.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"August 3, 2020",42,"Reading reviews, I really expected more from this drug.  I built up a tolerance to Adderall due to long work hours.  I’ve been taking 50-70mg of Vyvanse, but still completely out of gas in the afternoons.  Asked my doctor for Modafinil at highest starting dose, so he gave me 200mg.  This dosage did nothing for me.  Overall, for me, there is a boost of energy/motivation about 2 hours after taking it (which doesn’t last long), then EXTREME fatigue in the afternoon/evening. Leaves me feeling worse and overall just kind of off.  I’m really bummed",ASA
10,Modafinil,Fatigue,6.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"June 28, 2020",20,"I was prescribed Modafinil for daytime sleepiness. I don't take it regularly though as I think it would be too easy to lose track of your own natural body signals and then burn out. For me 100mg is fine when I need to concentrate on something boring on that day and am really sleepy, whether it is cleaning or reports for work. Sometimes I speak too much within the first few hours so it's better to limit social interactions until later in the day! The next day I feel clearer but won't have another one for at least a week. If I do then I have noticed it starts to feel quite horrible and doesn't have the same effect. Despite all of this once my Provigil runs out I won't get any more as I want to find a natural way to maintain energy if I can! I have been prescribed both a generic and the Provigil. For me the generic was better - I think it's just personal.",BimBam
11,Modafinil,Fatigue,4.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"April 28, 2020",31,"Modafinil worked great for me, at first, to be alert and increase productivity, until I was out of medication and my fatigue hit me like a freight train stopping all productivity. The headaches were avoided when I stayed hydrated and only took in the first half of the day. It controlled my appetite and even help with weight loss and management. It sounds pretty good at first but after a few months I realized I was creating a bigger problem than I had before. Please do yourself a favor and only take if and as prescribed by your doctor and well monitored. There are a lot of miracle drugs and nootropics available out there if you search hard enough. This is not all that hard to come by and can have more risk and long term negative effects than benefits, if not taken properly. Please be careful and don’t make problems worse for yourself or others.",Jon
12,Modafinil,Fatigue,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"March 10, 2020",25,"I had been taking Provigil for about 5 yrs., then the insurance co. would not pay for it any longer as it is very expensive. So, I started to take it in generic form, which is Modafinal. It did not work as well, but it was better than nothing. I continued to take the Modafinil for a couple of years and then my pharmacy switched mfgs. to Aurobindo. There was a definite difference in side effects with this company's product. It did not work, but seemed to have an opposite effect. Also, it made me feel fuzzy headed, flu like symptoms, headache, dizzy, all kinds of bad. I called my insurance co. and after speaking to 3 people I had Provigil approved. I am now free of all the bad side effects of Aurobindo Modafinil. My advice, get Provigil and don't take no for an answer.",Frustrated
13,Modafinil,Fatigue,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"February 3, 2020",35,"This medication  modafinil was AWFUL. I was prescribed 100mg to take daily for chronic fatigue syndrome. Here's what happened: I felt like my brain completely shut off. ADD to the max... unable to focus, lingering headache turned full blown migraine, apathetic. If anything, I felt more exhausted, it messed with my vision and created so much pressure behind my eyes that I had a hard time focusing in on anything. It made my brain feel silent... all thoughts were muted, like I was only a hollow vessel. This is not me; my brain normally works a million miles per hour, I can multitask, I can focus... I'm just exhausted and that's why this was prescribed. I would not recommend this medication. I wish it would've helped.",Em

I was hopeful after seeing all the reviews and some comparing it to the ""limitless"" drug (not that I believed that) but I was let down. I took it the first day with no food..about an hour laterI felt jittery, just uncomfortable and later in the day that anxious feeling in my chest for a little while. Felt just as tired as usual.Waited a couple days and tried half a pill and felt nothing. So the next day tried a whole one again with food and hated the feeling again.

I've experienced noticeable less fatigue and better concentration, but also somehow it seems to making social interactions less stressful (I must say I'm not having any kind of social anxiety, just being maybe a shy person). Absolutely no side effects noticed, it starts working after 2 to 3 hours and lasting for about 8 to 12 for 200mg dose.",Fox
17,Modafinil,Fatigue,10.0,,"October 30, 2019",36,"Since my hospitalization with lung nodules in 2016, I have been totally devoid of energy. Recently, it has gotten worse. I spend most of the day in my recliner. My PCP prescribed modafinil and I took my first tablet this morning. The walk I took this evening approached power walking! It is now 10 PM and I am sitting here feeling as alert as I did when I first woke up this morning. In my particular case it has been nothing short of amazing. Viagra for the brain is how one article I read referred to modafinil. It has energized both brain and body. I couldn’t be happier! It’s a very expensive drug, so remember to use vouchers etc and shop around I cannot recommend it highly enough!",USAMaid
18,Modafinil,Fatigue,10.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"October 22, 2019",52,"Modafinal actually WORKED! I was a privatized combat medic/ER doctor and an adrenaline junkie. I have broken so many bones that it looks like it was hit by a train. During my last injury in the Middle East, I found out that I had severe SA and RA. Now I understand why I would become so fatigued when the natural adrenaline was not pumping through me. I do not take Modafinil every day so I do not get used to it, and as a doctor, I can make adjustments myself.  It has made a big difference.  If the dosage is not working for you, PLEASE inform your doctor and they can help with adjusting the right amount.",doctor-elysee
19,Modafinil,Fatigue,7.0,,"September 26, 2019",32,"The first time I took modafinil was amazing. I’m having a hard time so using it for productivity at the desk, however it lifts my mood right away and it also makes me enjoy stuff more and be more social.I have insomnia so either way I have to take sleep pills this makes my sleep aid need stronger so undecided.I think the trick for office work is to only take once you took the first step in the project at hand otherwise it will help procrastinate because it gives energy for other things and makes u stay focus in that thing till u finish.  I have hope for this medication but I have to figure out my dosage , frequency etc   For the headaches just drink plenty of water before you get the headache and you won’t.   Good luck !

Increased dose just to get the same effect. (For me, just making it through the day!). No super powers for me but I can’t function without it.

I was taking Adderall to help with my excessive tiredness and wanted to try something safer and less addictive. I am pleasantly surprised with Modafinil. I can take one 200 mg pill in the morning before work, and I feel the effects long after I get home. I can feel it start working right away. I get a little head buzz, my eyes seem to open a little bit more, and I’m generally happier to be awake and starting the day. No crash or comedown.  Sleep can be very tough If this drug is taken too late in the day. Also, I do get pretty bad dry mouth while taking Modafinil. Make sure you have water around 24/7. Overall, I am satisfied for what this drug does for me and would recommend to anyone looking for a drug to help them stay awake and alert all day, with way less side effects than Adderall and much less habit-forming.",Danigee92

I was expecting a huge improvement from the reviews but I was beyond disappointed. I think the people that only benefit from this drug are the types who fall for the  placebo effect.

By no means is this a miracle cure, but it will keep you awake. It will not give you energy, like amphetamines. It will no produce euphoria. At higher doses, I'm taking 400mg b.i.d as needed, since my 2000mg dose of meth per day ceased. At that high a dose, I feel a bit jittery, more of a caffeine like effect for the first hour. Duration for me is about 5 hours with an almost immediate crash. The best thing is, if you are determined to quit meth, this is a helpful tool.

The cost can be prohibitive and my insurance company just dropped it from their formulary so I have to depend on samples from my psychiatrist.",DrWildCat
54,Modafinil,Fatigue,10.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"November 9, 2012",59,"Absolutely changed my life. Started in early August. I can't describe it, there is no euphoria, no speed. I wake up take it and just attack the day in a steady calculated way. I used to drink a pot of coffee a day. I haven't had a cup of coffee since I started Provigil. I had all types of medicines for my anxiety and depression, ironically this is what works. Weird, but the by-product of being so productive each day and the feeling I set and achieve obtainable goals eliminated my anxiety and depression overnight. The first day I took it, 30 minutes after it kicked in, it was like something finally just clicked. This medicine has changed my life. I had 12 types of medicines, I tossed them all, now just Provigil and one for high blood pressure.",ProvoMeUp
55,Modafinil,Fatigue,9.0,,"February 20, 2012",37,"I've been taking Provigil (200mg) a day now for about a year.  My neurologist prescribed it for my MS fatigue.  At first, I felt like I was having a ""party in my head"", but that only lasted for a week or so.  I also got a slight headache during this time.  Nothing huge that a normal dose of Advil wouldn't solve.  That doesn't happen anymore though.  I definitely have to take it early in the morning or I will be up too late (2-3 AM).  I find that I am much more focused on whatever task I need to do, including driving.  When my husband and I go on a road trip I seem to be the one who will NOT get sleepy and ""entranced"" by long miles in the dark.  Definitely, Do Not have any alcohol with this medicine, even 1 or 2 drinks = unfun!",Alenorea
