0,Naproxen,Costochondritis,9.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"March 4, 2022",0,"I've had Costochronditis for several years now (on and off) and ibuprofen has always got rid of the pain, until 24th Feb 2022.  The pain lasted for over a week and I had to call the doctor as I couldn't even sleep for more than two hours at a time it was that painful.  He prescribed me naproxen (never taken them before) said they might have side effects but I've never had side effects from any medication.  I took one tablet along with omeprazole and the pain is actually getting easier to manage.  The omeprazole was to prevent ulcers in this stomach as naproxen does this also the stomach can get a bleed and all sorts of stuff can happen through taking naproxen. I live in the uk so never paid for this prescription",Herwithnoname
