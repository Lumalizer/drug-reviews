0,Aleve,Costochondritis,,,"August 23, 2017",7,Been taking 800 mg of Ibuprofen three times a day for 12 days per docs order with little relief for Chostocondritis and back pain.   Getting pretty bummed out so decided to try Aleve (not generic - the time release isn't the same) and within hours had relief.  Finally able to sit comfortably!,KellyBellyBoo
1,Aleve,Costochondritis,10.0,,"March 17, 2015",19,"I've been diagnosed with costochondritis for 2 yrs now. I have other joint issues, along with military neck and tendinitis. Nothing has worked as well and effectively as Aleve. I take anywhere from 220-500mg when needed. All my aches and pains subside and I can move about freely. Even with nerve damage. I am so thankful for Aleve!",Dee8Dee
