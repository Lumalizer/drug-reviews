0,Xylocaine,Costochondritis,9,Taken for less than 1 month,"November 23, 2021",0,"This has been prescribed for back and nerve pain. I've recently had a infusion into my hand (right) to see if it would help the nerve pain I've been suffering for over 20 years and I have to say I'm over the moon with my 1st results.  I have no pain in my back on the right side, and for the 1st time in over 20 years+. I sat up on the bed without any help, this is my 1st of 3 procedures I've been told, so far the only thing I've noticed is feeling a little over warm, and not trying to overdo things. Looking forward to my next one.",MamaSmurf
1,Xylocaine,Costochondritis,10,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"October 22, 2019",13,"I had severe back pain for years along my bra line area Degenerative disc disease. I would wake up in the night in such bad pain it would be hard for me to take a breath. After seeing many doctors and taking many different pain pills I was referred to a pain specialist who gave me lidocaine injections into the sore spots of my back. I felt instant relief. And was relatively pain-free for six months and had to go again. This felt like a miracle, after trying so many different things, to be able to tolerate the pain I  continue to have. I wish I would have been told about lidocaine injections a lot sooner!",Kris
2,Xylocaine,Costochondritis,10,,"July 10, 2013",21,"After being diagnosed with costochondritis, I was given a narcotic painkiller, NSAIDs, voltaren gel, and lidocaine patches to help with the pain (which was hideous). None of these medications provided relief, so I was referred to my rheumatologist to receive steroid injections. However, my rheumatologist suggested trying injections of xylocaine into the cartilage of the affected ribs. By the time I got home, ALL of the pain was gone. It has been 3 days now, and I am still pain free. These injections were a miracle solution for me, and I would absolutely recommend trying this before doing steroid injections to anyone who has costochondritis. I did not feel the injections or the medication going in, and have had no side effects whatsoever.",Suzannah Johnson
