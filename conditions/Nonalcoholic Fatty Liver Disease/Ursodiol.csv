1,Ursodiol,Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease,5,Taken for 10 years or more,"March 1, 2021",14,"I was diagnosed with fatty liver almost 15 years ago. The doctor first put me on Actigall, then after 5 or 6 years he put me on Ursodiol. He has since retired and my new doctors say taking this medicine is useless and not benefiting me at all and will not prescribe it for me. I don't understand why they basically cut me off, and have not recommended a replacement medicine. Any advice would be greatly appreciated.",Big John
