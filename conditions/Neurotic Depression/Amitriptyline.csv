0,Amitriptyline,Neurotic Depression,7,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"January 28, 2022",1,I was put on Amitriptyline 4 years ago for back and leg pain issues. I was taking up to 150mg per day and found that it does nothing for my pain but does help the Anxiety and Depression that I was going through. I am down to only taking 50mg now but I couldnâ€™t give it good ratings for pain.,Anonymous
