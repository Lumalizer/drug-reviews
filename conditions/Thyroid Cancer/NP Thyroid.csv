0,NP Thyroid,Thyroid Cancer,1,,"January 26, 2021",8,"I was on nature throid for years. When they stopped making the naturethroid I was switched to thyroid np. I thought I was going crazy. I was horribly depressed, had constant anxiety from the time I woke up until the time I went to bed. All day long every day consisted of battling constant panic attacks. My heart was constantly racing. I called my dr who then prescribed antidepressants, which I couldn't take. They also gave me horrible side effects. So I started trying to figure out what was wrong with me because I am normally not depressed at all and extremely happy person. I ended up in the ER who switched me to armour. Since day one of the switch, my anxiety is almost gone. My heart stopped racing. I have not had one single panic attack and I am no longer depressed. I don't know what is in this medication but it was awful and I wouldn't take it again even if it were the only option. Stay away from this medication if you can!! Most Horrible awful experience of my life!",Mickey
1,NP Thyroid,Thyroid Cancer,1,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"October 26, 2019",38,"When I found NP Thyroid 11 months ago I got my life back. I struggled for a year on different medications after a total thyroidectomy for cancer but now  Acella changed all that. That's over now. They changed the supplier for the active ingredient claiming it worked exactly the same. It does not. I am having memory problems, brain fog, heart palpitations, headache and a burning throat. There is something wrong with these pills. No more NP Thyroid for me.",BowAndArrow
2,NP Thyroid,Thyroid Cancer,1,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"October 9, 2019",21,"I also have been feeling bloated, tired, and pain in my chest and arm. I thought it was because of my recent surgery after Easter.  I started smell the smell of cat urine while taking my pill,  and thought it was weird because I never realized it before.  I googled recalls on these NP 330 thyroid pills and found this site. Thank God! This is probably why I am not feeling well lately.  I tried calling the company Acella, but they haven't returned my calls yet,  so I just called the FDA. 8884636332. I explained the situation,  and mentioned this site,  plus told her to look herself, not sure if she will.  Anyway,  she said that anyone that is, or has had issues need to fill out a form called Med Watch.  This the way to get them to investigate.  Thanks everyone! Let's help others that aren't aware.",Susmith911
