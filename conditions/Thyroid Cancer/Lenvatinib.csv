0,Lenvatinib,Thyroid Cancer,9,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"October 22, 2020",2,"Lenvima (lenvatinib):Started taking Lenvima about 36 months ago. No immediate side effect and 6 months later, I began losing weight via nausea/vomiting/diarrhea, for a total of 102 lbs. Not sure that's the best way to do it though. Painful right leg swelling makes it hard to get around, but a walker helps (bonus: you have an instant chair when you're waiting on slow lines!)Overall, there are many different little annoyances, but the bright side is you're still alive! Don't take it for granted!!",Ago Something
