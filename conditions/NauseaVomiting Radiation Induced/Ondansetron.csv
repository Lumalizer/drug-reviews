1,Ondansetron,NauseaVomiting Radiation Induced,,,"July 19, 2010",25,"Zofran (ondansetron):After radiation my husband could not keep anything down. If he coughed, sneezed, brushed his teeth or just consumed food he would throw up. After taking this drug for three days it has made a world of difference. It is costly but worth the outcome.",survivor-whigham
2,Ondansetron,NauseaVomiting Radiation Induced,10.0,,"March 3, 2010",33,"Zofran (ondansetron):I have esphogeal cancer, having radiation daily and chemo weekly.  This medicine is so precise about keeping the nausea and vomiting down I can tell exactly when a dose is due.  1 every 12 hours. I am thankful this medicine is there.  The side effects are very bearable (unknown concerning liver).  It is very expensive but if you have a severe issue - the money is not your main concern.  If you have cancer, there are agencies that can help with the drug cost.  Try AM Cancer Soc.  Maybe they can help guide you. Keep your spirits up and prayers in your daily life.  Take Care.",praying for a healing
