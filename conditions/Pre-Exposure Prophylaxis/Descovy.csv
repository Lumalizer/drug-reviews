1,Descovy,Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis,1,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"November 30, 2021",0,"After 7 weeks of absolute torture, I am taking myself off this med. Daily puking for the 1st week. Intermittent vomiting episodes have persisted the entire time. Excessive flatulence occurs randomly throughout each day. My hands hand feet are always cold, I have muscle cramps, foamy urine and am constantly lethargic and irritable. I am, by nature, a very promiscuous person. Until I took this drug, that is. For me, it was an abstinence drug, as I couldn't fathom having sex most of the time I was taking this. Would not recommend. I understand that a certain percentage of users will experience side effects. Well, I had them all.",Strate Swinger
