0,Clopidogrel,Acute Coronary Syndrome,1.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"February 13, 2020",11,"Heart attack on 6th December, 5 days in coronary ward. Given this drug and after a month I developed painful joints, wheezing in chest, shallow breathing at night, racing heart beat, Itchy flaky skin on right foot. Red spots and swelling, moving up to just below the knee.  Told DR It was medication related. Doctor gave me a course of fluclox antibiotics, thinking it was an infection / cellulitis. Didn't touch it!Yesterday forgot to take meds in morning, foot felt better, less itchy. Took meds around 7pm, rash started itching again, skin cracking and sore. Using raw coconut oil to soften skin and provide anti-inflammatory relief, which is working well. Tried steroid cream, had to wash it off as increased rash and more painful.  Today decided to stop using clobidogrel. Lower leg feels less itchy.Hope this helps someone else.",AKFletcher
