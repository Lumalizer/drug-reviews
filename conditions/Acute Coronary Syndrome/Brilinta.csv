0,Brilinta,Acute Coronary Syndrome,4.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"November 30, 2021",2,"Given Brilinta (90mg twice a day) after angioplasty and 1 stent in my left anterior descending artery. On the second day, as I was retrieving my medication prior to discharge, I felt an almost surreal feeling of suffocation I never had before - I just couldn't breathe in enough air for 1 hour. Moreover, I could speak much without being out of breath. I persevered for a week and these symptoms were replaced by stomach aches plus a sensation of a lump in my throat. I agree (based on scientific evidence) that this could potentially a life saving drug. However, the side effects can be horrible, especially for someone who has had a heart attack (in fear if another could occur, though it could all be drug related),",BacardiBenson

4,Brilinta,Acute Coronary Syndrome,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"November 28, 2019",34,"I started having shakiness and hyperactivity the day after angioplasty.  The doctors emphasized Brilinta is key to keeping the stents open. I am very sensitive to pharmaceuticals...I thought it might be one of the drugs but the doctors thought otherwise - attributing it to all the stress of the procedure and one small artery they could not stent.Then angina came back with shortness of breath.  Started Imdur to counteract chest pain but shortness of breath (SOB) continued.  The chest pain and shortness of breath continued to get worse so went to ER with angina, SOB, racing heart, coughing and impending sense of doom.  Ended up staying overnight.  Heart checked out ok and doctors finally attributed issues of angina, SOB and GERD to the side effects of Brilinta.Now I am on Plavix and no side effects so far.  I was really regretting getting the stents and thought the alternative might have been better.  Brilinta might be preferred drug for PCI but the side effects are horrible.",Gini
5,Brilinta,Acute Coronary Syndrome,3.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"August 24, 2019",13,The drug Brillinta worked BUT was so expensive I was switched to Plavix.. Their drug assistance program is a sham..,Smokejumper
6,Brilinta,Acute Coronary Syndrome,,,"July 20, 2019",11,I have taken Brilinta for a year after my angioplasty. I did not experience any side effects as such and it was like a regular medicine for me. I think it worked well for me..,GB
7,Brilinta,Acute Coronary Syndrome,1.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"July 12, 2019",47,On Brilinta 10 months and then switched to Plavix. I was paying $400 per month for Brilinta and my Cardiologist had me in a study as they all make money using us as test rats. Plavix costs $7.50 for a 90 day supply folks so don't be BULLIED into using Brilanta.,Gregg
8,Brilinta,Acute Coronary Syndrome,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"June 3, 2019",18,It was so bad having this drug. It has too many side effects. From the first dosage it started stomach aching and I had pain. Would never recommend.,UHP
9,Brilinta,Acute Coronary Syndrome,5.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"May 22, 2019",37,"Have been on Brilinta for almost 2 months after 1 stent. The shortness of breath is terrible. Sleep is spotty, so I'm doubly exhausted.  I wake up multiple times needing to sit up and breathe.  My gout has flared up continually since I started this drug, which used to hit every 3 months. All in all, I hate it.",Bob
10,Brilinta,Acute Coronary Syndrome,5.0,,"May 12, 2019",67,"I received Brilinta during procedure when I had 1 stent placed during angiogram I had acute coronary syndrome  .In recovery, I had extreme shortness of breath, chest tightness, breast tissue ache, & extreme upper back pain.  I told a nurse.  Was this a heart attack? 3 cardiologists arrived. They agreed these were known side effects, told me why Brilinta was chosen, but agreed Plavix worked just as good & much better for me.  Brilinta was stopped and my side effect symptoms resolved within hours. I'm lucky I have (3) responsive doctors.It's a cruel joke when a drug given to treat CV issues has side effects that mirror a CV event.  Regardless of how good the drug is, IMO this can damage health/mental state of patients taking this drug to avoid CV problems.  Shaken confidence can contribute to less optimal recovery.  Doctors should pay attention to experiences & discuss side effects if they choose this drug.  Then Brilinta can be used with confidence, or replaced quickly for those who have adverse reactions.",Surprise Diagnosis

13,Brilinta,Acute Coronary Syndrome,3.0,,"February 5, 2018",24,My son was put on this drug after 2 stents and a mild heart attack.  At that time (2 1/2 months ago) he also experienced urinary problems and further testing reveals he also has a mass in/on his bladder and needs surgery.  The cardiologist has refused to change the Brilinta and says he must wait at least 4 months to have the surgery.  Every one in our family is most concerned.,Xon

The shortness of breath got better after one month. I am constantly tired and frequently napping. The worst side effect has been 4 months of constant gout. I am now at the maximum dose of allopurinol to control my gout.I cannot wait to change over to Plavix  even though it will mean frequent blood testing.,Feller1
18,Brilinta,Acute Coronary Syndrome,5.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"January 29, 2017",47,"Had heart attack 12/15/2016 and put on Brilinta 90mg twice a day, plus 81mg Aspirin once a day. I experienced shortness of breath, and a cough. Went to see my Cardiologist, he says the shortness of breath will get better, and the cough is not related to the Brilinta. Recently I started feeling soreness on the tops of my hands I press on the veins, and soreness increases. I have now developed large bruises on the top of both hands, with slight swelling.  My vision also has changed,  bluryness in my left eye, I see no documentation that this is a side effect. Anyone else have this?",Babyslothsarecute

20,Brilinta,Acute Coronary Syndrome,10.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"December 4, 2016",32,"I've been reading other people's experiences and I wonder if I'm on the same medication. I am 74 years old, and I've been on Brilinta with 81 aspirin since 2/29/16, when I had 92% blockage in the widow maker, the descending major heart artery. Thankful that I was in the doctor's office when I had my heart attack, I ended up with two stents and Brilinta. I have had no noticeable side effects. I exercise three days a week in our local life center, with both aerobic and resistance exercises, and I have never experienced anything like the excessive fatigue I read others complaining of. Other than cuts or scrapes taking a little longer to coagulate I have had no bleeding to complain about. Maybe the Brilinta I'm receiving is just better.",Irishhorse
21,Brilinta,Acute Coronary Syndrome,7.0,,"November 3, 2016",28,Had bypass 20 years ago. August 2016 had to have 2 stents and was put on Brilinta. Short of breath most of time. But fatigue is huge problem. MD says if caused by Brilinta maybe time to try Plavix. Not sure if that will be any better. All these meds have such horrible side effects!,NightRyder604

Now I know why; Brilinta. Very fatigued also. Takes All morning to get going. Some rear-thigh cramps at night also. Other than that I suppose it's working to keep me from having a clot form.

26,Brilinta,Acute Coronary Syndrome,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"February 6, 2016",61,"Why on earth would Brlinita be approved for heart patients when shortness of breathe is a side affect. A pretty sick joke. I was not amused and told the doctor I would not continue taking it, regardless what the drug rep said of the side affect potentially leaving in a few days.",Offended
27,Brilinta,Acute Coronary Syndrome,1.0,,"February 4, 2016",75,My Mom was placed on Brillenta on 1/4/16 and was in the hospital. As soon as she was placed on the medication she complained of a funny feeling in her stomach. Was discharged 4 days later and still had a funny feeling in her stomach...which was blamed on anxiety. She continued to complain to doctors about this funny feeling up until taken back to the ER on 1-26-16 for the funny feeling...ultimately my Mom passed away on 1/27/16 with a GI bleed...I'm very concerned it was caused by this drug!,Schamole
28,Brilinta,Acute Coronary Syndrome,10.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"January 21, 2016",28,"Had a heart attack four years ago & for the first three years afterward, Plavix was my prescribed medication as a blood thinner.  I kept complaining to my physician that I was experiencing something weird; what I called a ""roving arthritis"".  I was usually waking in the mornings with one or both hands so swollen in the joints that I couldn't hold a coffee cup. Or, I'd get out of bed & could only limp around due to swollen, painful ankles. I was miserable, so I finally did my own research online & found Brilinta.  About one month after switching to Brilinta, my joint pain has totally stopped!  On Brilinta for almost a year; a very positive experience.  Only 1  negative: my insurance doesn't cover near as much as Plavix. Very spendy.",Nanuck of the North
