0,Decadron,Shock,1,Taken for less than 1 month,"February 5, 2021",7,"I was given this twice through IV after a nut allergy gave me anaphylaxis and put me in the ER.  Within seconds of administering my groin area, vaginal area and arm pits were burning like they were on fire. I screamed it was so bad.   At some point afterwards I started blacking out. I ended up receiving another dose somehow. I went temporarily deaf and blind. I thought it was the end of me. I became violent and hostile. I was not my normal self. They had to strap me down and sedate me. The next day I woke up in the ICU.  I was wet like I had peed my pants. Every time I would stand fluid was coming out of me like when your water breaks. This kept on for 3 days. I couldn't even walk to the bathroom without it happening. I was not pregnant. By day 4 I was heavily bleeding. A few days later it finally stopped. I didn't have another period for 5 years and it nearly sterilized me. I haven't had a successful pregnancy since this event. I was told to never again take a steroid, especially this one.",ReginaJo
