0,Clarithromycin,Mycoplasma Pneumonia,1,,"January 3, 2022",0,"I only took one pill and in the next few hours I've got the metallic taste in mouth, great hunger, and very sharp stomach pain, like I drank pure ethanol. I also felt anxious and couldn't sleep, feeling very tired and like I was losing consciousness at one moment and hyperactive at next. Not taking another pill!! Highly not recommended!",Anonymous

2,Clarithromycin,Mycoplasma Pneumonia,9,Taken for less than 1 month,"January 14, 2019",1,"I was prescribed clarithromycin by my GP for pneumonia : 2 tablets, twice a day, for 7 days.  I do feel better.... but I noticed another thing this antibiotic helped cure.  When I was brushing my sensitive teeth... I noticed no more bleeding ... no more gingivitis.  I Googled "" clarithromycin and gingivitis"" and was surprised to  find a case study on this topic with the same results from the patient.",LD
3,Clarithromycin,Mycoplasma Pneumonia,10,,"January 10, 2019",1,"I had a chest infection which was attempted to be treated with amoxicillin, after becoming very unwell and admitted to hospital temp 41c , heart rate of 160. I was isolated and presumed to have flu - i had Mycoplasma Pneumoniae. I was treated for two days in hospital and prescribed 500mg clarythromycin twice daily for two weeks. I am now on day 8 and do feel better but I am still coughing up a lot of 'gunk'. The only side affect I would say is a bit of an upset tummy but I've no appetite anyway.",Nurseontheotherside
4,Clarithromycin,Mycoplasma Pneumonia,1,,"March 18, 2017",2,"Was meant to be on penicillin but the hospital changed my antibiotic 5 mins before I left because they found mycoplasma in my throat (they didn't really know what was wrong with me tbh). My symptoms are spot on to  a so I'm leaning towards that as what I have (its certainly not tonsilitis or 'stress' which they tried to fob me off with). I have taken 4 of these clarithromycin and I think they may be the devil in pill form. I have had nothing but shortness of breath, stomach cramps, vomiting and diarrhoea since. Apparently they are common side effects, but this seems ridiculous. I felt better of with just the pneumonia than with being on these!",*Lydia-May*
5,Clarithromycin,Mycoplasma Pneumonia,8,Taken for less than 1 month,"January 22, 2013",5,"For pneumonia, I was prescribed 250mg for 2 weeks. Pneumonia still lingering, so I've now been prescribed double the dose at 500mg. I am now experiencing the bitter, metallic taste, but so long as it works!",AustralianJen
