0,Azithromycin,Mycoplasma Pneumonia,,,"November 29, 2015",11,"(PART 1) I took (4) 250mg of Azythromycin at once as directed by my doctor on Wednesday. I felt fine Wednesday, but I had loose stool/diarrhea after 2 hours, I also felt very bloated, my belly was hard to the touch, but no major stomach ache or pain. That evening I started to develop really bad head ache, and the next day it progressed into migrane, (and I have never ever in my life had one). I took acetaminophen 500mg but that only helped for like an hour, I spend my whole day in bed because I felt crappy and I had sensitivity to light and my vision was much blurred.  This migraine lasted for 2 days (THU and FRI). Saturday I felt better, but I still had a headache but no migraine. Sat night I developed a fever (99.7F) and I took NightQuil.",Anonymous
