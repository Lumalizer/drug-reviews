1,Bupropion,Sexual Dysfunction SSRI Induced,8.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"February 16, 2022",0,"I have suffered from anorgasmia for over 10 years now and my urologist did not offer an explanation. I achieved an erection and orgasm but there is no pleasure at ejaculation.  This  situation upset me, because I was a sexually active man for my entire life and orgasms were intense.  About 4 months ago, the doctor prescribed Lexapro to treat anxiety.  Within 10 days of taking it, achieving an erection and orgasm was nearly impossible.   My doctor switched me to Bupropion (200 mg/day).  Within 4 days of taking it, my orgasms returned with a vengeance.    I had never experienced such an intense orgasm in over 10 years - it was explosive and traveled from my groin to my feet!   I also noticed that I was more horny.  The intense orgasms continued each time I ejaculated, which was on average once per day.  However, after maybe 3-4 weeks of taking Bupropion,  the orgasm intensity began to wane.  Even after ejaculating less, maybe every other day, the intense orgasm was never as good.","69 years, male"
2,Bupropion,Sexual Dysfunction SSRI Induced,10.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"February 14, 2022",1,Bupropion has been a god send.  I’m a 65 year old male who was on Paroxetine and because of that given up on sex.  Paroxetine had got rid of my ability to orgasm or ejaculate.  My doctor put me on bupropion XL 150mg and what a change.  My mood is stable and depression has remained under control.  But my sex life has come back with a vengeance.  Orgasms are insanely intense and long lasting.  I am in a constant state of semi arousal.  I am beginning 300mg daily so that will be interesting.  Emotionally I’m not sacrificing anything but gaining back my sex life. A win-win.,Drummerboy

I took Paxil many years ago so recall the sexual difficulties or an SSRI, but I found that Bupropion also has adverse sexual side effects. Over the past month I have not been stimulated or aroused or interested in masturbation. Additionally, my manhood has been more flaccid than it is usually. When I did have sex once last week, I had an uncontrollable premature ejaculation, which I've never really had before. Then, after that, I wasn't able to get erect again, and remained flaccid, even though I've had multiple consecutive erections and ejaculations with the same person before (up to 5 times in a row at times) AND I had taken 1mg of Sidenafil! This time, I was basically one and done. I will keep taking it for some of the energy and motivation it provides, and the feelings of positivity, but I hope to get off of it soon–or when I have a more regular sexual partner.",Anon

Day 1 I was full of anger followed by bouts of anxiety and crying. I was sent home from work and put on leave for my mental instability. Day 2 I was extremely irritable and crying every few hours. Day 3 was the deal breaker. I was home alone and randomly started crying. Crying turned into a major panic attack and from there I was thrown into a state of hysteria.

I’ve been on Wellbutrin xl 300 mg for over a year and it’s helped a lot with my depression and I’m a much more functional person on it than off it. It comes with one huge negative drawback though which is premature ejaculation.

I had sexual side effects that ended up causing me to discontinue use. I’d say that Wellbutrin has made my libido higher than its baseline. It gives me a little energy and motivation but is in no way like a traditional stimulant. I find it less effective on depression and anxiety than the SSRI's But I still prefer it due to the lack of sexual side effects and the motivation boost.  I notice myself being more irritable and almost like I’m just looking for things to anger me during driving, work and social interactions, etc. I’m not sure if the anger is more a placebo effect as I knew it was a common side effect before I started. I wouldn't say it affects my sleep one way or another.   I like Wellbutrin but if I got into a dark place with depression and anxiety, I would add back in some Prozac. I wish there were more options for depression medication that doesn't have sexual side effects.",kginger

41,Bupropion,Sexual Dysfunction SSRI Induced,2.0,,"August 11, 2018",144,"46 year old male. Started taking Bupropion (branded as Zyban) to help stop smoking. Unfortunately, within 1 day I completely lost the ability to o orgasm.  I persisted once and 'forced' an orgasm. I immediately had an awful migraine-like headache.  I suspect that those who find Bupropion helps their sex life, had low dopamine levels; Bupropion increases the effects of dopamine.  For those like me, where Bupropion has killed their sex life, I suspect dopamine levels were already high - If you take a NDRI when you already have high dopamine levels, it will kill your libido/ability to orgasm, as the brain literally thinks you are always 'post-orgasm'! Orgasm is the point when the brain releases the most dopamine (narcotic drugs aside). If dopamine levels are too high, the brain thinks you have recently reached orgasm and will not allow you to orgasm (easily) to prevent very high dopamine levels, which can be harmful (can cause psychosis).

I also feel a lot better and a lot more calm. I also like how I’m able to focus on a task like I use to pre medication.  With the Zoloft it made me so lazy and even took away my good anxiety.
