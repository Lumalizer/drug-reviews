0,Viagra,Sexual Dysfunction SSRI Induced,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"January 1, 2022",4,"I was unsure whether I needed viagra as I'm a 35 year old man who can normally gain an erection. But the last month or so when masturbating I have noticed me losing my erection towards the end so ejaculation felt rushed and forced.My wife and I haven't had a great sex life and I think it's partly due to always having had anxiety around sex and losing stiffness after the initial excitement. I've only now put 2 and 2 together after my experiences the last month.Anyway, long story short after using viagra we just had great sex and I was able to maintain my erection so I could focus on my stamina. I took one 50mg pill an hour before.",Display name

6,Viagra,Sexual Dysfunction SSRI Induced,,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"December 31, 2016",57,"Because it's VERY expensive and 25, 50, and 100 mg pills all cost the same, I cut 100 mg pills into 4 pieces, though not with total accuracy.  25 mg is enough for me.  For me it begins to take effect in about 30 minutes and is fully effective by about 40 minutes.  The effect lasts for at least 2 hours and I experience no side effects.  I suppose if I wanted it to last longer I could take another 25 mg since I'd still be at only 1/2 of the maximum recommended dosage which is 100 mg.  It gives me an extra hard erection.  I don't use Viagra every time though.There are pill cutters available which make it easier to cut pills.",FRE0

Worked well, but 4 hours or so after taking it, it wore off.  Yes, was trying more than 1 hardy attempt! This went on for almost a year. Doctor switched me over to Cialis.
