0,Sildenafil,Sexual Dysfunction SSRI Induced,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"March 6, 2022",0,"All I can say is wow. I took one in the morning on an empty stomach, as directed. I am 55 and have had issues from time to time over the past year. They say to try it by yourself the first time so you can see how it works for you. Keeps the stress down the first time. I was amazed at how long I stayed hard within the first 45 minutes. As the election went down, I was able to just think about sexual situations and it came back. I am very pleased with the results.",Anonymous
1,Sildenafil,Sexual Dysfunction SSRI Induced,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"January 9, 2022",1,"100mg tab . Like many others after getting put on Mood enhancers I would have a random issue where me and the wife would be hammering it out then for no reason it would loose the hardness and the wife would be annoyed and turned into an issue. this only happened occasionally so I'm not sure what the deal was. It could have been a mental thing or worried that the kids would walk in on us. I talked to the doctor and she gave me some of this. The results were beyond my expectations. I can go so much longer, so much harder and absolutely no side effects at all. Except the wife is going to make sure that we keep an ample stock in our house. Amazing!",Drewski
2,Sildenafil,Sexual Dysfunction SSRI Induced,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"January 1, 2022",4,"Viagra (sildenafil):I was unsure whether I needed viagra as I'm a 35 year old man who can normally gain an erection. But the last month or so when masturbating I have noticed me losing my erection towards the end so ejaculation felt rushed and forced.My wife and I haven't had a great sex life and I think it's partly due to always having had anxiety around sex and losing stiffness after the initial excitement. I've only now put 2 and 2 together after my experiences the last month.Anyway, long story short after using viagra we just had great sex and I was able to maintain my erection so I could focus on my stamina. I took one 50mg pill an hour before.",Display name

I got rock hard with a little foreplay and after entering her, she was amazed at my hardness. Wow, I could even have gotten it up again for a second round. I think we will like the results.",Happy Husband
5,Sildenafil,Sexual Dysfunction SSRI Induced,3.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"September 2, 2020",29,"Purchased 100mg tablets with the intent of cutting the pills in half. What I found was that the medication was inconsistent. What I mean by that was one tablet was the equivalent of 10 mg, the next basically a placebo, and the next 100mg. I’m glad I don’t need this as a life saving medication or I’d probably be dead. Absolutely no quality control by the manufacturer.",RMAC

9,Sildenafil,Sexual Dysfunction SSRI Induced,10.0,Taken for 10 years or more,"July 24, 2018",6,"In Oct 2017  I had a leg injury that required some stitches. They gave me a synthetic painkiller drug called Ultram and then additionally gave me another drug called Zofran for nausea well I was on 100 mg of Zoloft daily. Painkiller Ultram mixed with Zofran mixed with Zoloft created serotonin syndrome which lasted damn near 12 weeks. Additionally gave me high blood pressure of 295 over 150 and hospitalized me. So now I'm kind of freaked out to take any type of pharmaceutical drug whatsoever and I check everything that may affect the SSRI and cause that serotonin syndrome. Fortunately that's not the case with Viagra, it appears that it's plenty safe to take an SSRI I take about 25 mg kicks in about half an hour, last almost a full day off and on and I get a slight headache that's about it good luck and check all drug interactions...",Serotonin syndrome case ex.
10,Sildenafil,Sexual Dysfunction SSRI Induced,9.0,,"March 29, 2018",31,Viagra (sildenafil):No problems here. I've been using generic Viagra for a couple years and have had MUCH success.

13,Sildenafil,Sexual Dysfunction SSRI Induced,10.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"February 18, 2018",18,"I am a somewhat healthy 30 year old male. And recently, my doctor has prescribed me zoloft for my anxiety. It is a SSRI. And as you know, certain SSRI's (anti-depressants)may cause libido and erection issues, depending on your state of mind and chemical structure of your body. Well, unfortunately for me, time to time it does cause a little bit of an erection issue. So, my doc prescribed me generic viagra- Sildenafil 20 mg tabs. I find that if you take about one and a half pills it works like a charm. It works well with no nauseated affects or headaches. And it's ten times cheaper! If your looking for a ED pill instead of spending insane amounts of money on the name brand or sexual enhancers. Give this a go brothers! No.. this is not a fake review by the way. It is just the nick name lol. out-",Pickle Rick
14,Sildenafil,Sexual Dysfunction SSRI Induced,6.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"December 13, 2017",3,"I have taken the brand name ED rx's, such as 50-100mg Viagra/ 10-20mg cialis, 100 mg Stanza but the prices per pill are prohibitive. I had the best result with 10-20mg, cialis hands down. They will be available as a generic SEPT 2018 . I have tried the generic form of Viagra, it comes on fast but doesn't last for over say an hour or hour and a half. It is much cheaper #30 pills,  20mg -$20, The maker of viagra are also going to market a generic version as well as Teva. I'd rather try the brand names companies generic since the teva are not that great in my opinion.",302GUY

20,Sildenafil,Sexual Dysfunction SSRI Induced,,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"December 31, 2016",57,"Viagra (sildenafil):Because it's VERY expensive and 25, 50, and 100 mg pills all cost the same, I cut 100 mg pills into 4 pieces, though not with total accuracy.  25 mg is enough for me.  For me it begins to take effect in about 30 minutes and is fully effective by about 40 minutes.  The effect lasts for at least 2 hours and I experience no side effects.  I suppose if I wanted it to last longer I could take another 25 mg since I'd still be at only 1/2 of the maximum recommended dosage which is 100 mg.  It gives me an extra hard erection.  I don't use Viagra every time though.There are pill cutters available which make it easier to cut pills.",FRE0
