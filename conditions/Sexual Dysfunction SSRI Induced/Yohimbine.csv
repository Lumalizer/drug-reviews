0,Yohimbine,Sexual Dysfunction SSRI Induced,8,,"June 30, 2020",6,"I suffered a prolonged medication induced erection twice in one week. They were both so painful that I had to go to the ER to have my erection surgically drained. An awful and embarrassing experience all together. Especially while 2 pretty nurses checked me in to be seen and giggled. I had recently been prescribed trazadone for sleep. One of the side effects is prolonged erection. After the operations, I had extreme difficulty maintaining an erection. I began trying natural supplements. I started with horny goat weed and had minimal results. Next I tried Yohimbine in powder form and within 30-45 mins, I noticed I was feeling horny and getting an erection. I immediately informed my wife who was all to happy to hear I was feeling normal again. The sex felt great and I climaxed powerfully. I highly recommend trying Yohimbine for ED. It definitely worked for me.",Tuck

Although this medicine is not commonly prescribed in the US, it's available in my country, and with a three times a day administration, it did increase libido and anorgasmia.Nevertheless, some side-effects are very discomforting, and include diaforesis, anxiety and hypersalivation.",andi1103
