0,Buspirone,Sexual Dysfunction SSRI Induced,9.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"February 16, 2022",2,"I didn't know that increased sexual arousal was a side affect of this medicine until I noticed my libido shot up through the roof. I am on an antidepressant and my sexual drive was pretty in the toilet. I tried wellbutrinin, but had to stop due to dizziness and shaking. This stuff works great for my anxiety and libido. I'm trying to find a dose that works and doesn't make me too sleepy. I think 15 mg once or twice a day is probably the sweet spot.",Techgirl
1,Buspirone,Sexual Dysfunction SSRI Induced,1.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"December 26, 2021",4,"Stay away for Buspirone. Shortly after the beginning of the Covid-19 outbreak,  due to the anxiety I had a problem reaching climax so the doctor put me on Buspirone. The first night that I took it I still woke up with erections, but after 4 weeks of being on Buspirone I had less interest in sex and my erections were limp and weak. It's now 4 months later and I don't remember what an erection felt or looked like other than the 2 days I decided to not take Buspirone a few weeks ago.",Jack
2,Buspirone,Sexual Dysfunction SSRI Induced,5.0,Taken for 5 to 10 years,"December 15, 2021",2,"I have been on Buspirone 15mg for over 5 years. I am also taking Forfivo XL. My sex life is over. My libido is not the issue. I can go. The problem is, I can not ever ever finish. It sucks on my side. No orgasm for me. It makes you just not want to have sex anymore.",Wrighmr
3,Buspirone,Sexual Dysfunction SSRI Induced,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"December 2, 2021",3,Yesterday and today I started Buspirone for the first time for anxiety (5mg twice a day). I'm a female and last night and today I was feeling VERY uncharacteristically  aroused. I couldn’t understand why this came on so suddenly. After googling I realized this seems to be common. I know this typically takes a couple weeks to work for anxiety but I definitely thing it did the other thing… Only other side effect was a mellowish feeling about 45min after taking the first two doses. The first two I took without food. My 3rd dose I took with food. I can’t say I'm complaining  but as a single girl with impulse control issues I can see this being an issue later on.,MyFirstDose
4,Buspirone,Sexual Dysfunction SSRI Induced,6.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"September 3, 2021",4,Some very good advice stay off a motorcycle if you're taking BuSpar because you will not be yourself riding your bike. It's very dangerous to take this drug if you're riding a motorcycle starting and stopping but not steady riding on the highway. It's a strange feeling but this drug makes you feel very unsafe small amount of vertigo that you really don't notice but it is there. Take my advice if you were on this drug stay off of a motorcycle. You might be safer on a bicycle. I noticed these symptoms when I was on it and they went away when I taking it. It's in a different class of benzodiazepines and works a lot different. You will be fine in a car driving but stay off of a cycle just some good advice. I'm talking about somebody that rides a motorcycle that is riding very normal. Take my advice you won't be sorry.,Wayne traube
5,Buspirone,Sexual Dysfunction SSRI Induced,5.0,,"June 4, 2021",16,This has really increased my sex drive. It is like  viagra for my vagina - it tingles. My sex drive is back. I love this drug.,Hfsjhf
6,Buspirone,Sexual Dysfunction SSRI Induced,9.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"March 5, 2021",40,"I am 72, taken SSRI's for several years, libido disappeared.

7,Buspirone,Sexual Dysfunction SSRI Induced,9.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"February 5, 2021",42,"So I tried Lexapro last year for 3 months or so and it completely got rid my sex drive and ability to orgasm. It took the edge off my anxiety but the effects weren't THAT mind blowing, it wasn't worth the side effects. Recently my anxiety started flaring up pretty bad so I talked to my doctor who suggested I try Buspar. I haven't been on it long enough to really know if it's going to help the anxiety because it comes and goes, but I can say after a week that it DOES increase libido. I noticed I had the desire nightly (usually it's 1-2 times a week) so I looked it up and found this forum of similar accounts! I'm like, what if this is the answer to my problems... it helps with anxiety AND will help me match my husband's drive haha. I'm a believer!",abeliever
8,Buspirone,Sexual Dysfunction SSRI Induced,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"December 17, 2020",23,Finally some relief. I've had good luck with 20 mg of Fluoxetine for a few years but my only complaint it that it completely zaps my sex drive. I tried Wellbutrin but I didn't have stellar results and it was too activating. 10 mg of Buspirone has been very helpful in increasing libido for me.,Cloutz

10,Buspirone,Sexual Dysfunction SSRI Induced,9.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"November 27, 2020",29,"Only 5 mg a day for 7 days and I noticed an elevated libido. And it was definitely not a placebo effect, since I had no idea that, that was one of the effects of Buspirone. Actually I searched for it because I felt urge for sex again for ""no reason"" .",Bama

12,Buspirone,Sexual Dysfunction SSRI Induced,10.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"June 21, 2020",70,I was on Lexapro for about 6 months for anxiety!!  It basically brought my sex life to an end. Difficulty maintaining an erection and premature ejaculation. Been on buspar for over a month and my sex life is better than ever!!  No more premature ejaculation and my erection is harder and better than ever!!  I’m 45 years old and I feel 20 again!!,Chance
13,Buspirone,Sexual Dysfunction SSRI Induced,10.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"October 17, 2019",107,"I got put on buspirone for libido problems and my libido came back like it was in my teenage years within a few days of taking 15 mg daily. I didn't know curing sexual dysfunction was a side effect. Made me feel human again, my libido had been dead for 4.5 yrs due to extreme domestic abuse. Talk about feeling alive again.",Kat
14,Buspirone,Sexual Dysfunction SSRI Induced,10.0,,"October 8, 2019",50,"So after 10 years of having difficulty in my sex life, keeping an erection, Diagnosed with bi polar, mania, and panic attacks and insomnia I was prescribed buspar and after just a few days this is what it has helped my sex life back like I was in my teens . I’d even say that it has been increased and surpassed my functionality. Another thing I noticed immediately was my dreams were back. My dose that I started with was 10mg 2 times per day but I noticed my panic attacks coming back mid day and was bumped up to 3x a day. Still taking them till this day . Personal experience, tricyclic antidepressants weren't good for me. Over the span of 20 years and multiple diagnoses I come to the realization that buspirone is enough on its own to live a functional life but with the addition of Xanax or Klonopin I sleep much longer than just the 5 hours as I do with buspar alone .",John
15,Buspirone,Sexual Dysfunction SSRI Induced,10.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"June 21, 2019",103,"Listen up fellas. I have GAD and panic attacks. My Dr gave me Lexapro and I was on it for 5 days. NEVER AGAIN! Although Lexapro really helps relieve symptoms of anxiety and panic attacks, your sex drive tanks and you can't have a orgasm. So I had to choose between side effects and keeping my sanity. I chose keeping my sanity obviously. I'll talk to my doctor and some friends and they were all recommending buspirone I started 5mg 3x day. I noticed it also helped with general anxiety symptoms along with helping me get more sleep during the night and my sex drive not only came back but it was better than it was before and I have nothing but good things to say about buspar on because it helps with my anxiety and my sex life is amazing powerful. Whoever invented the stuff deserves to be a billionaire.",Jay
16,Buspirone,Sexual Dysfunction SSRI Induced,8.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"November 2, 2018",52,"I had a horrible experience when I tried to get off of mirtazapine. After a really bad withdrawal I had to get back on it but still had bad anxiety and much difficulty with sexual dysfunction.  After finding out about this drug on the internet I got my doctor to give me a prescription of 20 mg, 10 in morning and 10 in afternoon. For the first month it didn't do much, but my anxiety was a little better. By the second month it was helping quite a bit with the anxiety but not so much for sex.  Then when I realized how short the half life was I started taking it about an hour before sex and WOW!  I now take 20mg about an hour before and have been having incredible orgasms. I also take one velvet bean capsule just before.  I am so thankful that this medication has helped with anxiety and given me back my sex life!",NOMOREMIRT
17,Buspirone,Sexual Dysfunction SSRI Induced,,Taken for less than 1 month,"June 15, 2018",23,"I took Buspar several years ago to help with severe anxiety I had. I can’t recall how helpful it was overall, but it did make me feel calmer for a reasonable amount of time after taking each pill (approx. an hour or two). It mostly made me drowsy and increased my libido. Fast forward today, I’ve finally found the SSRI that works better than any medicine I’ve ever taken for depression, Prozac. After some internet research, I’ve learned that Buspar can help with sexual side effects caused by SSRIs. I’m hoping it’ll help restore some of my sexual desire and sensitivity. From my past experience with it, I assume it should help. I’ll see.",INFJLuke
18,Buspirone,Sexual Dysfunction SSRI Induced,1.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"November 27, 2017",49,"I have severe OCD.  I wasn't diagnosed until I was about 19 or 20 at which point they immediately started shoving antidepressants down my throat.  They caused immediate ED so I quit taking them.  Well, for the most part, it's never come back. Pills don't work, pumps don't work, I've gone to therapy and everything else under the sun to try and fix the problem with no luck.  I take doctor monitored testosterone injections so my levels are good yet not only do I still have ED, but no sex drive, and now I can't even feel it when I have an orgasm anymore.  I took Buspirone hoping to help this and the results were an epic failure.  A complete waste of money.  I'm 45 and have basically given up on love and happiness.",rjasonm
19,Buspirone,Sexual Dysfunction SSRI Induced,10.0,,"July 8, 2017",109,"Wow. This drug really restored my ability to have an orgasm. I have been complaining about Lexapro destroying my sex drive to my doctor since I started Lexapro. It was getting to the point where I had to choose between a sex life and my sanity. Unfortunately, my doctor didn't do anything about it. I was the one who had to ask if I could take Buspar, after internet research. Lexapro reduced my social and generalised anxiety by, I would say, 80%. Buspar restored my ability to have an orgasm, and also seems to be reducing my anxiety even further. I know everyone reacts differently to these medications differently, but if you are having these issues, I would give this a try.",PersonPersonPerson82
20,Buspirone,Sexual Dysfunction SSRI Induced,10.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"February 1, 2017",82,"I have OCD-induced anxiety and depression, for which I was taking the SSRI Luvox. Luvox caused me sexual dysfunction (difficulty reaching orgasm and delayed ejaculation), so my psychiatrist prescribed 5mg of buspirone to take 3 times a day. This medication works well to boost desire and makes the orgasms feel good. I have since stopped taking Luvox, and now rely solely on buspirone for my anxiety. This medication generally boosts my mood. That said, I am surprised by the number of people who are prescribed this medication ""as needed."" This is not a benzodiazepine, and in order to feel the anxiolytic effects, it is necessary to take buspirone 2-3 times a day for at least two weeks.",R.W.J.

When I upped my dose of Lexapro to 7.5mg, I began experiencing trouble reaching orgasm once more. I've let my doctor know and we're working on a solution.

I did not know that this medicine could help. I did not get this medicine for this reason. I also take Lexapro for bipolar and depression...so I think it could be worth a try to see if this medicine helps.
