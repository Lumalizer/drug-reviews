0,Taltz,Plaque Psoriasis,10.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"March 19, 2022",0,"I have now been on Taltz for ~ 2 years and it has helped me to the point where I have been lucky enough to be able to sometimes completely forget my condition. Before Taltz I tried UVB, methotrexate, cyclosporine, Otezla and Humira. None worked for me at all, with cyclosporine and Otelza giving me lots of side effects. Since about 1-2 months in of using Taltz I have been 100% clear. Zero outbreaks during 2yrs on it. I have not been suffering from any respiratory infections (actually less than rest of the family), but I have noticed I have herpes outbreaks more frequently than I used to (I've only had them twice in 10yrs before Taltz, now ~3-4/year). Injection site pain is really only thing I can complain about, but I'd rather endure that pain once a month and live a psoriasis free life! Based on the reviews and experiences I've read here I might try injecting in the stomach next time, maybe less pain?",Aura
1,Taltz,Plaque Psoriasis,8.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"January 20, 2022",0,"Was on another medication (Cosentyx) until insurance shut me down and I switched to Taltz.  Both worked really well for my plaque psoriasis, pretty much complete clearance achieved in ~3 months.  The only major difference between the two was that the Taltz injection was easily 5x as painful.  If Cosentyx was a fly landing on your hand, Taltz was a hornet sting.  I suppose it's worth the pain if you have good clearance, but ouch.",Matt
2,Taltz,Plaque Psoriasis,9.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"December 24, 2021",1,"I have to say that it's been good for me, I have been self injecting since my 1st dose. I am now on my 5th dose. For me for me it was more of a mental barrier to self inject,  Obviously no one likes poking themselves with needles. But once I got past it, it was easy. I mainly do it on my stomach because it is less painful than the leg or the arm trust me.  I have not experienced side effects and I am a smoker and I drink occasionally.  I would say my plaque psoriasis is about 80% gone, and my sores were bad and thick with scales.",E36forlifeyo
3,Taltz,Plaque Psoriasis,4.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"November 14, 2021",0,"I starting having my plaque psoriasis about 8 years ago, during my mid 40's. No explanation, just 75% coverage in skin with inverse psoriasis in groin areas that were extremely itching and uncomfortable. Started taking Taltz about 3.5 years ago and was 90% clear within 3 months,  even the inverse psoriasis. It did nothing for my psoriatic arthritis though. Unfortunately I lost mmt job and my insurance and the ability to continue treatment. Within 6 months the plaque psoriasis and inverse psoriasis came back with a vengeance, covering 90% of my body and making my joints so painful I could hardly walk.I was finally able to get back on Taltz about a year ago. It has not been nearly as  effective this time around. Scalp/ears completely covered and large patches on back, knees and stomach/groin still present.  Still have about 30% plaque on body and the inverse psoriasis in my groin areas areas even worse. It seems when I stopped taking it, it no longer was as effective. Help!!",Anonymous

My main problem was the skin but it also helped the joint pain. Side effects were a little nausea at first but you can ask your doctor for some Zofran and that goes away. The injections hurt slightly for a tiny bit but it’s negligible and well worth it. Very easy to use.

The dermatologist switched me to Taltz 4 months ago. Initially I thought it was going to work as the first month it appeared to get better, however now three months later I have dealt with thrush I cannot get rid of and a rash all over my shoulders and upper back and chest that is so painful and itchy. Any sunlight now makes my skin crawl and it is in the middle of summer. The plaques are returning at a multiplying rate. The injections are horribly painful. I have a high tolerance for pain (no epidural with either of two pregnancies) and this is awful. Apparently there is a reason why my insurance would not cover this.",From bad to worse

My chronic psoriasis was the worst the doctor had seen me when I got my prescription. I was covered head to toe, except luckily my face and hands don’t really get psoriasis. Anyway after a week on Taltz I was completely clear. It was like magic and made me cry I was so happy. I have never been this clear in 38 years except for short bursts during phototherapy. I did get a bit of an infection down below and felt a little unwell a few weeks into treatment but it has settled. I do have irritation at the injection sites. But all of that is worth being clear.

Had tried Enbrel, Humira and Cimzia which worked well on my Psoriasis arthritis but (PsA) but not my skin. After a bout with strep and a huge full body flare up. It was ugly and painful. I went to the dermatologist who recommended Taltz. Consulted my Rheumatologist the next week and we decided to try it. Rheum had never prescribed Taltz to her patients. In 3 months my skin was clearer and my PsA was controlled. In 6 months my skin had cleared up completely. I deal with some IBD and elevated liver numbers on Taltz but if I drink more water, less alcohol and exercise I can keep my numbers in check. What a relief it’s been for me and my skin and my health. The injections can be very painful but I’ve found injecting in my chubby stomach much less painful than my muscular thigh.",Megan Denver

Still fighting a serious fungal infection in my sinuses, and now today had xrays of my lungs, thinking i must have pneumonia . Now may also have serious fungal infection in my lungs. I am so mad at  Lilly for putting out such garbage, as  Talz makes people very sick. I understand that 27 % of all people get very sick on Taltz.  I have not noticed in a while now, any more commercials on TV, about Taltz. Did they take this off the market? I am still very ill, even being off of this drug, for 4 months.

49,Taltz,Plaque Psoriasis,8.0,,"September 18, 2018",9,"Have lived with severr plaque psoriasis for about 23 years. Never took any biologics to treat it.

By Day 10, only the thickest plaques left any buildup, although those areas did appear to start to get rougher. Week 2 injection seems to maintain it, though midway through Week 3 some itching has redeveloped, though it may only be a very mild reaction. Insurance won't cover since I didn't try Humira, but Taltz has been probably 90% effective so far and I doubt that Humira or Enbrel would have come even close to alleviating any symptoms given my experience so far.

100,Taltz,Plaque Psoriasis,10.0,,"November 10, 2016",41,I have been on this study for nearly 3 years.  My psoriasis has been a problem since I was young and have dealt with it for 30 years!  I have tried all sort of different drugs over that time and nothing has given even close to the same results as this.  It truly is a miracle.  I take one shot a month and I'm clean and clear of everything!  Just like others have posted it took about 2 weeks to show big improvements and by a month in you wouldn't ever guess I suffer from severe plaque psoriasis.  I thank all the doctors and nurses that have helped me through this process and I'm very happy to see this hit the market!  Hope it works as good for you as it has for me.,Taltzrocks
101,Taltz,Plaque Psoriasis,10.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"October 26, 2016",15,"I was using it by a trial, for a year and Im in love. My skin was clear like in the first 2 weeks of my first dose. I have 3 types of Psoriasis and works great.  I get my first prescription for it and still waiting for de Pharmacy to know how much is my copay. Never felt so great in my life and I was diagnosticated with Psoriasis for more than 20 years.Lo usé mediante prueba del medicamento por un año y quede completamente enamorada. Mi piel quedó limpia en las primeras 2 semanas luego de mi primera dosis. Tengo 3 tipos de Psoriasis y el medicamento trabaja increible. Ya obtuve mi primera receta y sigo esperando por la farmacia para saber cuanto es mi deducible.  Nunca habia tenido la piel tan limpia en mis 20 años de diagnosticada.","Completly in Love, Enamorada"
102,Taltz,Plaque Psoriasis,10.0,,"October 24, 2016",15,"My experience with taltz has been wonderful as far as the improvement but the cost of $12,500 is really outrageous. I was started by my dermatologist on samples and then hit with the price. I feel that this is discrimination and price gouging. If I was in a lower income bracket I would only have to pay $25.00 so apparently the cost to me and others is supplementing other people. I get regular phone calls from a nice little girl from Lilly Cares and I told her it's more like Lilly doesn't give a damn. I am now consulting an attorney and looking for other medications",Margaret Vogel

104,Taltz,Plaque Psoriasis,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"October 12, 2016",22,"I took my first dose a week ago.  Within days I started to see improvement.  I have psoriasis all over.  Some smaller spots, some larger than a softball.  Now at a week, my thickest plaques are almost gone.  I still have discoloration at the sites, but no plaques.  I've been on raptiva, which worked very well until they took it off the market.  I've been on humara, stelara, just about all the topicals you could name, and most recently embrel for the last few years.  I really can't believe how quickly this cleared my skin.  The only thing that gave me this type of result was cyclosporine and that took over a month tip get this clear.  I'll admit that the auto inject was not the most pleasant feeling and I typically use a prefilled syringe.",Matt3
105,Taltz,Plaque Psoriasis,9.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"September 20, 2016",20,After 3 injections I  have  had almost  total clearing. The only  scales left  are a small  area on my lower back.  This  had worked incredibly well .,Anonymous
106,Taltz,Plaque Psoriasis,10.0,,"September 9, 2016",46,"This stuff is absolutely amazing.  I've been on enbrel, stelara, humira, methotrexate, topicals, and none of them have ever done this well.  Within 3 days of the first injections I started to see clearing.  I thought, no way!  But it has only continued to get better.  I'm about to inject my week 5 dose and most of my areas are scale free.    My self esteem has gone way up.  My wife isn't complaining about flakes in the bed.  No bloody spots on the sheets from picking.  I can wear dark colored shirts, short sleeves, no sleeves again; and not be concerned about people staring.Yes, the injection stings.  Yes sometimes the injection leaves a swelling under the skin.  But for me, it is completely worth it.",Scott-123987
107,Taltz,Plaque Psoriasis,9.0,,"July 18, 2016",33,"Injection burns like fire!!  But the results are incredible.  After 3 treatments almost all areas are cleared.  Legs were raw and would bleed daily over most of lower leg. Now only slight redness still exist.  This has been a miracle drug so far. Had previously used Stellara and Otezla, without much results.",Meatloaf55
108,Taltz,Plaque Psoriasis,1.0,,"July 11, 2016",21,"Taltz caused severe swelling the size of hockey pucks that lasted an entire week at injection sites for the initial two injections (mid thigh). Thought is was just my body adjusting to the new medication but upon week #2 injection, an even worse reaction! Same ""hockey puck"" under my skin  as week #1 & spread to 8"" hardened ""pancake"" under the skin with redness, severe swelling, itching (for a week and counting).  It is painful and radiating heat, an under the skin ""hive"". My doctor believes I may be reacting to a certain protein often used in injections. I was on Stelara=no improvement, tried Humira and had some improvement but problems getting product shipped at proper refrigerated temps and flimsy injections needing to be replaced.",ATLPatient
109,Taltz,Plaque Psoriasis,10.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"June 7, 2016",56,"This drug is what my Doc put me on when I asked for Cosentyx. She said it had a little bit better success rate and might be a little cheaper.  She also told me that I would only have to do labs once per year.  I have moderate plaque P from head to toe.  I should say HAD. I am 99% clear at 4 weeks. I only have light spots where plaques used to be. The only other biologics I have had are Humira, which worked for a year or so, and Otezla, which did not work at all. The only side effects I have had have been a slight touch of digestive trouble and maybe one day of mild (flu like) body aches. My cost after insurance and copay assistance is 5 bucks per month. Needless to say I am super happy so far.  So far so great.",DWOK
