0,Dexamethasone,Plaque Psoriasis,9,Taken for less than 1 month,"February 13, 2020",11,"My doctor prescribed this medication for a bad cough. The side effect was a clearing of my psoriasis. Horrible red scaled skin on my elbows, chest, and groin have healed for a while. I took 13 pills, 2 a day for 5 days, and 1 a day for 3 days. I will ask my doctor to prescribe this every 3 months to prevent further flare ups.",Stanley B
1,Dexamethasone,Plaque Psoriasis,10,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"August 23, 2019",15,"Doctor said in 20 years she never saw Plaque Psoriasis as bad as mine, I looked like a breakout of the measles or something. So after 8 mg first day, in 30 minutes started feeling better, 3 days later clear skin.... haven't taken for a week and no flare returned. Picking up my script today taking 2mg 2 times a week and a week off to be mild on the body.",Quando62
2,Dexamethasone,Plaque Psoriasis,3,,"June 19, 2017",7,"Started the take this medicine for a tongue condition (Geographical tongue). I read it lowers my immune system and it definitely does. I only have one more day of it thank goodness. I feel horrible. My head hurts, my eyes are watery, & I constantly feel achey. I don't really see a difference in my tongue either. Just want to be off this medicine! Let's hope the withdrawals aren't bad either.",Larissa rep
