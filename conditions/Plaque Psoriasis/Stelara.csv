0,Stelara,Plaque Psoriasis,10.0,Taken for 10 years or more,"September 30, 2021",1,"Stelara completely cleared me of psoriasis.  My story is unusual as I started using Stelara as part of a control group on a medical study for a different drug.  From the first few treatments my skin cleared from psoriasis.  At the end of the study which was about two years in duration I was told that I had been receiving Stelara all along.  For now, as I'm employed and with good insurance, but if not the cost is prohibitive.",Cured me
1,Stelara,Plaque Psoriasis,10.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"November 13, 2019",7,About 80 % covered with psoriasis for years. Stelera cleared me until after the first month of the three month shot. Then came back with a vengeance. Couldn’t have another shot for 2 more weeks. That ended my freedom from itching and being finally able to wear a short sleeve shirt.  Trying cosentyx without much success.So wish I could have taken Stelera every month rather than every 3 months.,Purp

5,Stelara,Plaque Psoriasis,10.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"February 6, 2019",8,This wonderful drug is a game changer! Had psoriasis all my life really bad. Now it’s 98% gone I feel liberated. A day never passes that I don’t feel forever grateful for this amazing drug I was nervous about side effects as I react badly to a lot of drugs but no side effects at all. Just got over a cold without antibiotics so happy my immune system is still strong enough. A bit more worn out from the cold than I would have been before but small price to payNo cost to me thank you Irish health care system,Annie
6,Stelara,Plaque Psoriasis,8.0,,"January 19, 2019",7,"I had between 20 to 60% plaque psoriasis coverage over 40 years. My back was completely covered, my ribcage and scalp fully covered and forearms and legs heavy too. I have used diprobase, coal tar and UVB, methotrexate  betnovate, dovonex, PUVA & soralen, dovobet, and ciclosporin before using Stelara.I have been using Stelara since 2010 and saw instant improvements back then. Over the years it has been less effective but I am very happy to report that I have around 10% coverage during bad times and normally 5 to 7% coverage most of the time. This allows me to play sport, run and hike, although I get run down pretty easily after a long run or if I get a cold.It's important to listen to your body and I believe all problems come from my gut so I try to eat plant based if I can as it seems to calm my flareups. Interestingly, I went on a juice plan for 14 days and my psoriasis cleared completely which confirmed my gut theory although it's not a sustainable plan for me.",StuW
