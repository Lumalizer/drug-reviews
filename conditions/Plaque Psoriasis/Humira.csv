0,Humira,Plaque Psoriasis,10,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"September 26, 2021",1,"I have been diagnosed with severe psoriasis since January 2020. My dermatologist tried topicals first and did blood work & everything worked well. It started as a small patch on my scalp. It then progressed to all over my scalp to my face, ears, back, chest, stomach, legs & groin. It was at this time my doctor prescribed me Humira starting January 2021. After 3 months I am completely clear. I can go out in public and people not be afraid I have COVID. I am back to my normal beautiful skin. I have had no side effects & it only cost me 5 dollars a month! Humira has worked wonders. Plus all my lab work is coming back normal. I got my life back. :)",Rich
1,Humira,Plaque Psoriasis,1,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"June 24, 2021",2,"Before starting Humira, my Dr asked if I had any nerve issues and I explained lesions had been found on my brain in 2015 that they suspect may be MS, but I hadn't done confirmation MRI to confirm the diagnosis. He put me on it anyways and I trusted him. My psoriasis went away and I was happy until about a year into taking it when I started having serious cognitive issues, balance issues that cause nausea and weight loss,etc. I've been going thru testing for 6 months now, and more and more the neurologist and other specialists I'm now having to see regularly suspect the Humira is what caused the new lesions on my brain that are causing ALL of my neurological issues! I've had to leave my job because I was unable to work, my family has suffered, and while it was nice to have the psoriasis gone, it wasn't worth this.",Armywife19
2,Humira,Plaque Psoriasis,5,,"April 21, 2021",1,"59 never had psoriasis or family history. Got small rash and then a flare up on lower back. Never on knees or elbows, no joint pain. Maybe the propranolol caused it. I was taking too much (anxiety) and it triggers immune response.  In 5 minutes of only a visual exam derm said the p word, psoriasis. No way. Nonetheless, I was like, ok, give me a topical and I'll be on my way. He for some strange reason left the room and returned by saying "" I treat from inside "" Next, you got it, HUMIRA!!. I was naive and uneducated on biologics. I took it 12 months. I was without the few rashes week 10, but it probably would have left on its own. I continued taking H for a year and everything was ok. Fact, 0 side effects.   I think the Dermatologist checked my insurance when he left room. Month 14 I got urinary tract infection and that was it. Never had UTI in my life. It is a common side effect I found out later. It took me a month to get rid of...So I had to stop abruptly.  I never got H again",Steve L
3,Humira,Plaque Psoriasis,1,Taken for less than 1 month,"December 3, 2020",8,"Be very careful using this drug and do not let your clinician talk you into it unless you have a very severe case of psoriasis. My son took this drug and immediately developed neuropathy in his legs and hands. It did not go away and we eventually had to spend over 100,000 getting IVIG treatments to help. They did help but he still has a low level of neuropathy left in his legs. This drug has also caused lesions on people's spinal cords. BE VERY CAUTIOUS USING THIS MEDICATION. BE forewarned, if you have a problem with this drug and call the company they will cut you off and offer NO help. They do everything they can to keep you  on the drug but if you have a side effect they are no where to be found.",Anonymous
4,Humira,Plaque Psoriasis,9,,"November 29, 2020",0,"I was diagnosed about 2 months ago with plaque psoriasis and this condition really had me feeling depressed at first. My doctor referred me to a dermatologist, I began phototherapy the end of October and I started the Humira injections last week. Today I notice my skin clearing and I wasn't having a lot of pain so today I'm much happier with Humira",Dee
5,Humira,Plaque Psoriasis,10,Taken for less than 1 month,"July 26, 2020",11,"My husband had really severe plaque psoriasis on his elbows, knees, legs and head. After 2 treatments his skin looks AMAZING!!! His legs haven’t looked this clear in years. He always wore long sleeve shirts to cover his elbows and now he wears short sleeve. It has done wonders for his self esteem.",SND
6,Humira,Plaque Psoriasis,10,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"May 16, 2020",10,The Humira totally clears my skin and I was 60% or covered or better and you can't tell I have it at all and haven't been sick either this is a savior for me,Anonymous
7,Humira,Plaque Psoriasis,10,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"May 14, 2020",8,Starting taking Humira in December 2019 and it has been a life changer for me.  Psoriasis wouldn’t allow me to sleep.  Now I sleep through the night.  I had Psoriasis for 20 years and finally did something about it.This has certainly been a life changer for me and a miracle drug.,Life changer
8,Humira,Plaque Psoriasis,1,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"January 6, 2020",9,"Horrible stuff - made me sicker than a dog.  Fatigue, joint pain, and upper respiratory infections that I couldn’t get rid of - never had issues like that before. Every time I would do an injection I would break out in lesions.  About the time they would clear up it was time for another injection.  I wouldn’t recommend this to anyone unless you just enjoy feeling like death warmed over 24/7.  Since I stopped this med I feel SO much better - so far the psoriasis hasn’t returned so I’m keeping my fingers crossed.  What is mysterious if why the medical folks prescribing this junk are so unaware and in denial of the side effects.",Sme
9,Humira,Plaque Psoriasis,2,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"January 1, 2020",3,Humira is awful stuff.  Muscle & joint pain when I never had it before.  Upper respiratory infections that won’t clear up.  Bruising - like BIG bruises that have no specific cause.  Caused breakouts/flare ups.  Fatigue.  And this happened consistently every time I would do an injection.  This last injection time the upper respiratory infection started on December 19th and I still have it on New Year’s Eve.  I wouldn’t recommend this med to anyone.  The only upside is the Humira people are very nice and helpful.,Auntartika
10,Humira,Plaque Psoriasis,10,,"November 5, 2019",4,"Psoriasis & psoriatic arthritis: after years of unsuccessful treatments, Humira was 99-100% effective, completely clearing my skin & freeing me from arthritis. I was taken off Humira & put on Imraldi: skin still clear, but arthritis returned. As a drum-teacher, this is alarming. Pain significant; decreased joint mobility already affects me. I had fatigue/headaches with Humira. But weighed against benefits they're tolerable. Imraldi leaves me more fatigued; headaches more intense & persistent. I looked forward to Humira. I dread Imraldi. Big clunky needles are flimsy, breaking when used, failing to deliver medicine. I swapped to Imraldi pens: first failed; second worked but left a bruise on my leg (fortnight to clear). Tonights dose failed. I want back on Humira; quite literally a life-saver. I'm contacting the manufacturers of Imraldi to let them know my experiences. Hopefully they might improve the medicine and it's delivery methods?",SebulusPalmolive
11,Humira,Plaque Psoriasis,10,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"October 11, 2019",4,"Humira is a wonderful medicine.  I am 99% free of my psoriasis with almost no side effects. The support from the Humira people has been tremendous.  I’ve been on it for 14 months.  My only problem is with my Dermatologist, who switched me to the citrate free, without my asking. My problem is with the thinner needle.  It takes a few seconds longer to inject and timing is critical.  My track record with the old needle is way better.  Still adjusting.",Khan
12,Humira,Plaque Psoriasis,10,Taken for less than 1 month,"August 29, 2019",9,I suffer from plaque psoriasis and rheumatoid arthritis in my knee.  I’ve been on and off Humira for about a decade now. This is the only drug that helps with both and it is quite amazing. I see results literally within one week. I highly recommend this drug to treat the above defects.,SebeTiger
13,Humira,Plaque Psoriasis,1,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"July 25, 2019",5,"I have been on Humira for over 5 months. I am not seeing any improvement. I looks like one big red blob on both upper and lower legs. In addition, I have gained 15lbs. I got psoriasis from taking Harvoni.",Raina
14,Humira,Plaque Psoriasis,1,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"September 6, 2018",5,"8 weeks on humira.  For 4 years I  have had plaques on only soles of my feet  . I finally decided to try Humira after no results with Otezla. Now it's on one of my legs and one of my arms  too and it did nothing for my feet, worse if anything and itching is still terrible. Do not recommend this drug. I am switching to cosentx.",Suzy
15,Humira,Plaque Psoriasis,1,,"August 14, 2018",7,"After taking Humira for 3 months the plaques are very tiny bit better but itch horribly. Unfortunately, I now also have pustular psoriasis and the psoriatic arthritis that hadn't been too much of a problem is much worse. I don't know why doctors want patients to continue this drug when it makes things worse. I had about 50% coverage with plaques. Now I have about 30% pustular in areas I've never had it before - back, underarms, face, arms, hands, legs, feet. Psoriasis is truly a terrible disease. Western medicine needs to quit poisoning people and get to the root.",Gems21
16,Humira,Plaque Psoriasis,7,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"July 24, 2018",5,"So far, so good. Been on Humira  for 4 weeks. I had Plaque on soles of feet which have cleared about 25%. Had tried Otezla in past with no clearing at all. Still adding steroid cream and laser, but swelling, itching, redness and plaques all show improvement. Injection is not that bad, just stings for a few seconds. I use the pre filled syringe, not the pen, as people have reviewed it as less painful. I was hesitant to go on this due to potential complications. But my quality of life is so improving every day that it's been well worth it.  Look forward to continued improvement in next few months.",Suzy
17,Humira,Plaque Psoriasis,8,,"July 24, 2018",8,"I started taking Humira when I was around 14-15 years old. I have now been on it for 7 years and it really does work. I have been 100% clear since taking it and before I was basically covered. I have been monitored closely and I get blood work every 6 months and nothing has ever been wrong, I never get sick. I have decided to stop taking it just recently because I get very chronic, long lasting, horrible Candida Infections that I know are caused by my Humira lowering my immune system.  Antifungals really dont work for me anymore and it has become a constant battle. Switching to Cosentyx and hoping that solves my problem and still causes my skin to stay clear!  But overall Humira has been great and works well.",L

19,Humira,Plaque Psoriasis,1,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"July 8, 2017",6,"Shots were painful, made my Psoriasis worse, developed plaque on palms of hands and bottom of feet and made other areas worse.  Since stopping it, have started Taltz which is helping but these lesions are very resistant to treatment. I went from having a mild case of Psoriasis to severe. I regret starting to take Biologics and should have stuck to topical medication. Advice do not start them if you can deal with them with topicals. You become dependent on them and then they stop working and you have to go on to a new drug with many potential side effects.",Awful 1
20,Humira,Plaque Psoriasis,10,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"May 17, 2017",8,"Have had psoriasis for 30 years I had a bad episode of planter fasciitis then the psoriasis affected my feet and lower legs really bad. So after fighting for three months finally got 80 percent paid by humira and it must go thru your insurance on the medical side and my Jehovah's got the co pay I am lucky. After a few months I am almost completely healed. Nothing but a big round, looks like a burn spot. No creams no lotions and potions.",Bad karma
21,Humira,Plaque Psoriasis,1,,"April 19, 2017",7,"Did not work for me, caused worsening of Psoriasis. I developed Psoriasis lesions in areas I never had before. Very dissatisfied, I was hoping it would really help since I read a lot of successful stories. I have had Psoriasis for 23 years and treated it with topical steroids and moisturizers. 2 years ago I started Otezla which worked for about 18 months. I started developing lesions on my hands. Then after starting Humira I developed lesions on the bottom of my feet and palmar aspect of my hands.  Systemic medications have actually caused my Psoriasis to worsen. If you can control it with topicals avoid systemic medications.  I am regretting taking these medications, there is no going back now. Now topicals don't work at all.",Unhappy and disappointed
22,Humira,Plaque Psoriasis,2,,"August 9, 2016",12,"I was on drug for about 6 months and had no side effects besides pain during drug injection.  My plaque psoriasis completely disappeared within the first 6 weeks and continued to do so until about 6 months later.  No rhyme or reason, but it stopped working and I'm in the WORST FLAIR of my life.  I've never had any issues with my hands or feet, but now that's my troubled spots.  My hands and feet are severely dry and peeling and the pain and itch is horrific.  I'm using all the medicated ointments and creams that my Dermatologist has prescribed, along with a new biologic Stelara, and nothing has stopped the flair.  I wrap my feet in Saran Wrap to help hold the moisture and medication in, and do the same with my hands with gloves.  HELP!",Anonymous
23,Humira,Plaque Psoriasis,5,,"July 22, 2016",16,"I was on Humira injections for one full year. My psoriasis completely cleared after three months however I did develop a couple of side effects. The first one came when I started having trouble with my left knee. I had been administrating the medicine in my thighs, alternating each thigh as instructed, but developed tendinitis. I couldn't admin the injection into my stomach due to severe scarring so I my only option were my thighs. It seemed to subside after the 6th month. During my 8th month on humira I noticed terrible stomach pains. I gained 15 pounds in only 8 months and started having gallbladder attacks. A few months later, I discontinued my humira and haven't had anymore digestive problems. Psoriasis is back with a vengeance though",Nicole563737

In 2013 I was diagnosed with plaque psoriasis :/ ointments helped at first but eventually my condition became worse. My self confidence was at an all time low, I couldn't go outside without feeling embarrassed. My doctor recommended Humira.  I have been on Humira for about 5 months now. I saw results in the first week. I was almost completely clear, I couldn't believe it. As time went on, my condition started improving day by day. Today IM COMPLETEY CLEAR!!!!!!!!!! I can't express my gratitude towards this medication enough. I haven't had any side effects in the five months I've been on it (knock on wood). I feel great and look great once again!

27,Humira,Plaque Psoriasis,1,,"November 27, 2015",19,"I read about all of the bad experiences with humira and I never thought it would happen to me. A week after taking my first humira shot I woke up in a horrible rash. This was no normal rash, my whole chest and back was broke out and it was burning. I took benadryl and went to work throughout the day the rash continued to spread over my whole body. I developed a butterfly rash on my face and very little sunlight was burning me.. I went the ER but they didn't know what to do so I went to a urgent care and they gave me prednisone .. The rash has cleared some but I still have it. This was horrifying I will never take it again and you better believe this could happen to you!",Drone tone
