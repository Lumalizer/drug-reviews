0,Tazorac,Plaque Psoriasis,8,Taken for less than 1 month,"August 9, 2019",0,"Hello there, I just started using tazorac for my plaque psoriasis and for mild acne on face. I have heard about people loosing hair bc of it. I am concerned because I have many areas on my body I'll be using it on for psoriasis. Anyone experiencing balding? Has this worked well for you? Thank you!",Megz
