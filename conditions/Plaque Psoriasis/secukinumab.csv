0,secukinumab,Plaque Psoriasis,10.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"February 3, 2022",0,"Cosentyx (secukinumab):15 years my psoriasis has been so bad in my hand, I had fear of loosing it.  At times it would smell of infection due to the layers of buildup.  Painful and unable to use much of the time.  I wore a glove due to unsightlyness.  I began with weekly injections x 4 wks and now injections monthly of Cosentyx. I'm in my 8th week of treatment.  The benefit has greatly exceeded my wildest expectations.  I can see actual skin on my hand first time in over 5 years.  Pain I have suffered for 15 years is gone.  First time in 5 years I can leave the house without a glove.  No side effects noted.  I feel I owe my hand to this company which pays most of my treatment cost.  From my company representative to my speciality pharmacy, everyone involved keeps check on me to see I'm on the right track.  I cannot thank you enough for giving me my hand back after 15 painful, embarrassing years.  I would not have believed had I not experienced it.  Injections are packaged to be ease of use.",Kimky111
1,secukinumab,Plaque Psoriasis,5.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"January 27, 2022",0,"Cosentyx (secukinumab):I used Cosentix for 2 years and started seeing good improvement on my psoriasis after the first 6 weeks but unfortunately didn't clear up my psoriasis 100%. In the lapse of the 2 years, I had  psoriasis that never went away on my hands (up side) elbows, a big plaque on my back that remains there until today and a few here and there. After the 2 years of use of Cosentyx Express Script totally denied the approval for another year and Cosentyx lab approved free of charge for 2 years but I got it only for a few months close to the end of last year. Then they asked for another doctor's request after I was approved for 2 years. For the meantime of approval my psoriasis went mad and I am still dealing with it and trying to get the best treatment this time but I am not going to continue with Cosentyx this time. Cosentyx it works, but for me it didn't work as expected.",Azalea

I tried methotrexate and etanercept prior to cosentyx, they proved equally as useless for me",Gina White

7,secukinumab,Plaque Psoriasis,1.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"December 15, 2020",3,Cosentyx (secukinumab):Cosentyx does not work with me. I’d be better off injecting saline solution. My psoriasis has more than tripled in coverage area. I was on Taltz before and within three days of the first injection I could tell a huge difference. But when covid came they couldn’t ship it to me in time and my psoriasis came back with a double punch. I have an appt with my doctor today. Hopefully he can help me out. I look like a leper.,misslp

10,secukinumab,Plaque Psoriasis,10.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"October 1, 2020",2,Cosentyx (secukinumab):Was on Humira for psoriasis plaques on elbows knuckles knees .That was first biologic and was wonderful tho never quite cleared it up.Also I take high doses of adderall and despite adding humira I never had abnormal blood tests. Super annoyed when corona started as apparently my doc office is getting paid off by novartis(cosentyx) bc they called me telling me to switch to cosentyx and stop humira. Pain in the butt but did it. Was going in the following week for my appointment and strangely the doc asked ME why switching? Uh I said you called ME and told me that the tumor suppressant is less broad in cosentyx than humira and I needed to change or take nothing because of covid.He was like hmmm thats interesting as if I'm telling him something when thats what HE was telling me via them calling me.Weird but blew it off,Jackie
11,secukinumab,Plaque Psoriasis,9.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"May 28, 2020",33,"Cosentyx (secukinumab):So, I previously left a review for Stelara - which I had stopped and then had a full blown inflammatory response in my body-joints, tendons, spine, and scalp psoriasis. I since started Cosentyx. I have done the five loading doses (300mg - 2 injections) and I honestly feel 10 x better. I felt so debilitated in the previous state. (I'm in my 30's and very active so debility should not be in my vocab). I still have a little residual arthritis in my hips and tendons but I think it will clear after a while *Fingers Crossed*. It supposed to take anywhere between 12-16 weeks to fully take effect so I have got time to be patient. IF not a little Tylenol and Aleve daily have been working well. I do not feel fatigued as I did with Stelara. I do get a random nasal drip but its manageable compared to the alternative. So I feel like I'm getting back to normal. I probably have to take a biologic for the rest of my life to function normal but if it works, I'm happy. I will up date as time goes on.",Beth

I started Cosentyx in February and it’s now May and the plaques have lightened a lot but haven’t went completely away. My biggest concern is that I’ve been actively working hard to lose weight since November and had lost close to 35lbs when I started Cosentyx. I’ve been on a strict diet since November and exercise program working out 5 to 6 days a week starting January. February I started the starter doses of 2 shots a week for 4 weeks of Cosentyx, I’ve gained the entire amount of weight back mainly in my midsection, regardless of how much I try to lose. I’ve taken the monthly dose now for 2 months and keep gaining. I’ve talked to my dermatologist about it and he just keeps referring to the companies claim it doesn’t cause weight gain. I disagree  because that’s the only thing that’s changed in my regiment. I think I’m going to stop taking. I’d deal with the psoriasis than to keep gaining.",GingerBeard

Within two weeks my psoriasis was clear! BUT I noticed my sinuses were awful and I’ve never had sinus problems before and I just generally felt bad. I decided to stop cosentyx in September of 2019. Since then I’ve had the worst flare up ever in my life. My legs are covered and now my forearms and scalp.

15,secukinumab,Plaque Psoriasis,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"February 24, 2020",16,"Cosentyx (secukinumab):I've had plaque psoriasis for about 5 years now, had it on my scalp as a child and it laid dormant until I turned 30 then BOOM covered in plaques all over. Was prescribed methotrexate originally in low doses which helped but never got me clear. Then slowly my doses had to be increased just to keep me somewhat controlled. I begged my Dr to let me try the newer meds (biologics), he was old school and insisted we stick with the old drugs. I was given a referral to a new dermatologist and thank God for him! Within the first week of my loading doses, my skin began to clear and also feel ""normal"". Those with psoriasis know how you feel it coming on just under the skin. I'm about to take my 4th loading dose and all that's left is the red areas where my bad plaques were. Every time I shower and exfoliate, they get lighter and fade more and more. The only side effects I've had are feeling slightly jittery directly after my injection and feeling tired. To curb that, I take my shots at bedtime now.",mrsjenn

I saw good results, with est. 80% plaque clear up in under 4 weeks. However, within the first 6 weeks I developed new onset Crohn's disease. Nobody in my family has a history of IBS. I lost almost half my body weight, suffered severe pain, bleeding, and missed months of work. The doctor doing my colonoscopy couldn't even get a 3rd of the way in without harming me. I'm not alone in this experience  there are other people who have had this experience. Novartis' website still claims that new onset Crohn's or IBS is not possible. I am now on Remicade supported by a high weekly dose of methotrxate, just to avoid having a flare up. I have not had a flare up since stopping Cosentyx.

She also suspected psoriatic arthritis due to my complaints of joint pain. After expensive lab work to check for TB/hepatitis, I was started on the 5 week starting dose of Cosentyx @ 300mg/week. After week 3-4 I noticed more sinus trouble than normal, developed an acne like rash on both sides of chest, psoriasis developed in ears/lobes, and scalp worsened. It did not do a thing for me & I do regret taking it. I found a new dermatologist who told me to d/c Cosentyx, gave me topicals & wants me to start Humira to treat PA and psoriasis. I’m nervous due to the reaction & lower immunity but told I need to treat PA or joints will worsen.

I was prescribed a two other medications to go with the Cosentyx, one for my ears and another for my eyes. Unfortunately after 4 months the ears and eyes have only gotten worse.

Second year of law school, developed a few small spots. Lived with it for 20 plus years with only two large patches on both ankles of which I would cover up; one big spot on my left knee. While on vacation, severe case of strep throat. Started Penicillin, cleared my strep throat up and  4 days later, my ENTIRE body flared up. It was horrible. This NEVER happened, ever before and was clearly caused by strep throat. Began first (nothing else) Cosenytx 300 mg. Just finished my 2nd dosage and starting 3rd Tuesday. It has ""SLOWLY"" helped. Itching is gone. The red patches have definitely reduced in their inflammation. I feel positive but the jury is still out. I will give it more time and see what happens.
