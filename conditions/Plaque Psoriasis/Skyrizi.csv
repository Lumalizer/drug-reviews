Not a lot of side effects I even had Covid just before my second dose. Everything went well I am so glad my dr stated me on this medicine.",J JR
1,Skyrizi,Plaque Psoriasis,10,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"September 8, 2021",8,"Been taking Skyrizi for more than a year now after failing on several other biologics, systematics for plaque psoriasis. Also went onto this medication with high blood pressure and heart issues and long covid symptoms. It cleared me within 4 weeks and I would say has the least amount of side effects out of any other biologic systematic I have taken. It also seems to control other misc inflammation and I have not become immune to it quickly unlike other medications, not a single lesion has returned I am 100% clear from having 20% severe coverage prior. I did get pneumonia recently unfortunately for the 4th time but antibiotics cleared it within a week, you do need to watch for infections if you are not getting better on your own see a doctor. This will happen on any biologic or systematic as it's my 4th time going through that. After what I have experienced, Skyrizi benefits outweigh the risks and in my opinion would be the least risky internal treatment for psoriasis.",mmikeman
