0,Otezla,Plaque Psoriasis,8.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"March 24, 2022",0,"Otezla was very effective for me!  After the first week of use I noticed a tremendous improvement with my skin.  BUT, LOL, it wasn't long before the diarrhea started and headaches.  I didn't mind the diarrhea so much as the headaches are what made me stop using Otezla.I would certainly recommend Otezla to anyone suffering from Plaque Psoriasis.  Hopefully your side effects will be more tolerable for you.",TrainMan
1,Otezla,Plaque Psoriasis,2.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"March 1, 2022",0,"Made psoriasis worse. Started having minor flair ups with another biologic, so switched to Otezla.  BIG MISTAKE. I now have heavy plaque psoriasis on scalp, and small patches in areas I've never had before.",User Bg
2,Otezla,Plaque Psoriasis,4.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"February 13, 2022",1,"I have Palmoplantar Pustular Psoriasis and have been on this 30mg 2x daily along w/ 17.5mg Acitretin (and the occasional Lewis Method using Halobetasol Ointment PRN, and 40% Urea cream to moisturize) for 11 months now and it has definitely worked on my hands and wasn't nearly as bad as Methotrexate, whether in pill or injection form.  I cannot wait to get off this medicine though, as for localized pustules, initially on my hands, they ended up spreading to the soles of my feet which hadn't happened before.  My scalp has psoriasis now, my alopecia that began on MTX is still ongoing.  I never stopped losing weight and in the 44 weeks I have measured I lost 26lbs (17.5% of my body weight) and am still losing over 0.5lbs/week.  Malnutrition and malabsorption are worse, bloody stools and GI pain, decreased appetite, etc.  The worst part by far has been my eustachian tube dysfunction and the ear infections that keep coming back.  Also it isn't forgiving if you miss a dose.  Great Discount Card though!",rswiss
3,Otezla,Plaque Psoriasis,1.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"February 2, 2022",0,"What worked:  solved 30% of psoriasis.  What didn't work:  At 5 months, it plateaued out and stopped working and my shoulders began hurting.  However, I kept taking it for few months hoping for the best.  Eventually I stopped when my shoulders became unstable and felt like they'd fall out of the socket.  I quit Otezla, but the shoulders continued going downhill.  It's two years later, I now have rotator cuff and labrum rips (from 1:00 to 11:00).  Disclosure:  Twelve years ago I had to stop taking Quinolones due to tendon pain (but no tears).  My uneducated guess is that Otezla is contraindicated in those with existing tendon damage ... or that Otezla itself is capable of causing tendon rupture.  Time will tell with others reporting.",Katherine

I had GI issues for the first 7-8 days before they started to go away. I had complications with having to skip one of the doses a day 2 times that I’m thinking have somewhat brought back my symptoms. Stomachs upset, gurgling, going to the restroom, pain, body is also shaky, weak and tense/on edge when my stomach gets like this. Indecisive if I wanna stay on this medication or not.",Anonymous
5,Otezla,Plaque Psoriasis,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"January 19, 2022",1,"Was a bit nervous before beginning Otezla after seeing some of these reviews, but I am proud to report that I have not had a single side-effect. I have been on this medication for 16 days (full dose for only 10) and I am beginning to clear up significantly. No itchiness, no longer scaly and very red - everything looks so much better already. My dermatologist said that I should be mostly back to normal by the end of the first month and recommended I stay on for a few months after (which I plan to). I am not going to call this a miracle drug, but my skin was the worst it ever looked, and I am on the up and up!",wt93
6,Otezla,Plaque Psoriasis,,,"January 16, 2022",0,I started Otezla yesterday morning trying to treat scalp psoriasis. I have had severe diarrhea since yesterday afternoon lasting all through the night. Also developed a severe headache and nausea though I have not vomited yet. Since I’ve only had 1 pill and been this sick from it it’s not for me. I’m sad I can’t take this medication as I really had high hopes.,Summer
7,Otezla,Plaque Psoriasis,2.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"January 14, 2022",0,"Be aware- this medication has a lot of negative side effects!! I Was on otezla for approximately 4 months, until I could no longer cope with all the side effects. the first week-  stomach pain, diarrhea, I felt dizzy and couldn't focus. As I continued to take the medication I started feeling extreme anxiety, panic attacks physically and mentally stressed and depressed, it tore my guts up so bad It felt like I may have been trying to get an ulcer. Along with the weird stomach issues I started not having an appetite what so ever which caused me to loose 20 lbs. ( Which I didn't need to loose). This made me feel weak and sicker. I also had bad Insomnia, and if I did sleep awoke exhausted!!! I wish it had worked - but in my 6 years of dealing with my plaque psoriasis this med has been the worst side effects I have had from a med. My skin did show some improvement but the negative on my mental/ physical well being, was just not worth it for me. I'm so happy for those it works for!",Ellie68

10,Otezla,Plaque Psoriasis,1.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"December 4, 2021",0,"I've taken Otezla for seventeen weeks, twice a day.  The only thing I can say is that my psoriasis is twice as bad now as it was before I started the Otezla on July 27, 2021.  When I started Otezla, I only had plaques on my right knee.  Now, I have outbreaks on my left knee, and scattered plaques on both arms, ankles, mid chest and lower front and back torso.  I don't know that I can solely blame Otezla, since I had a Tdap vaccine at the end of October; maybe that triggered or exacerbated the psoriasis. The timing does seem to point to Otezla as the main culprit.",Dave
11,Otezla,Plaque Psoriasis,3.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"October 23, 2021",0,"Started taking a few weeks ago and finally stopped taking it yesterday. Still get nausea & diarrhea after taking each dose. The last few days my symptoms seem to worsen. I become severely depressed, couldn't concentrate, and felt lightheaded and short of breath all the time. Yesterday I had to leave work because I became so shaky and light headed I almost passed out. I have no history of any of these issues and strongly feel it was the medication. After researching  the negative affects rate is higher then the success rate I'm mad I started Otezla in the first place.",Marie
12,Otezla,Plaque Psoriasis,,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"October 22, 2021",1,I'm so happy I tried Otezla before reading the negative reviews. I was told it could take up to a month to start working but I noticed results within three days of starting. I was worried about the doctors warning that it could make me nauseous because I have a weak stomach but luckily never had ANY side effects. I've been dealing with psoriasis for 40 years and have tried many prescription medications. This is the first thing that has ever helped. Not only did it help but after 5 weeks on Otezla my psoriasis is now 90% cleared up. If it would have made me nauseous I feel it may have been worth it for the results. I'm so grateful.,Anonymous

I have not suffered with any of the reported issues like nausea or diarrhea because I eat a little something before I take otezla, problem solved.  I do get the occasional migraine but I can’t say with certain its the otezla causing it.",Batty1
14,Otezla,Plaque Psoriasis,1.0,,"September 30, 2021",2,"Have you ever felt like you had the flu, morning sickness, and needed a toilet strapped to your rear end? Welcome to OTEZLA! I'm a 49 year old healthy female with great blood work, no obesity, and overall decent health besides plaque psoriasis. I tried Otezla for three weeks! Not only did I feel like someone kicked my ass during the whole three weeks, I also felt like I couldn't go anywhere without an emergency exit for my rear end. Nausea? Yup. Diarrhea? Yup. Headache? Yup. Fatigue? Yup. I normally walk 8,000 to 10,000 steps a day. I was lucky to get over 3,000 with Otezla. I've been living off ginger ale and crackers for the most part. When I do eat ""real food"" my stomach is tied up in knots and I either throw up or poop. Or both. Usually, it's both. The amount of sleep I have lost, the meals I haven't enjoyed and the minimal effect it's had on my psoriasis are not worth it. AT ALL.",Throne Queen

Has horrible nausea and diarrhea from the start with the symptoms still present but to lesser extent now. My psoriasis really isn't getting better and Betamethasone is the only one that seems to really work. Will probably have to find an alternative, but stuck through with it in hopes that it would work.

16,Otezla,Plaque Psoriasis,1.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"August 31, 2021",0,"I recently went off Otezla after a year of use because not only did it not even help, my psoriasis got so much worse. The plaques I already had got thicker and larger and just before I stopped talking it my entire chest and neck broke out in over 20 new spots and people kept telling me it looked like I was breaking out with a rash. I had to go back to using my greasy steriod cream but I can't use it on every spot or I'd go through a tube a day. And now I have to suffer with rebound Rosecea on my face due to a reaction from the steroids. And since I am one of the lucky few who get psoriasis on their eyelids I now have to get a different ointment to use on my face and it burns like mad. And my insurance doesn't want to cover it without jumping through hoops every time I need a refill because without insurance one tube costs $330. My life is now more miserable since Otezla because along with all of the side effects like upset stomach, diarrhea, and headaches, I got none of the benefits.",Caitdezjay

18,Otezla,Plaque Psoriasis,7.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"June 29, 2021",3,"I started Otezla 6 weeks ago.  The first weeks I had non stop headaches, nausea and stiff joints.  With my doctor's approval, I backed down from the recommended 60mg to 30mg and the side effects greatly improved.  My skin was improving too!!  But then.....the acid reflux hit.  Brutal acid reflux which aggravates my asthma and those two together are not tolerable.  I've had issues with GERD in the past so Otezla is not all to blame.  Just know if you are prone to GERD, Otezla may aggravate it even more so.  I stopped Otezla 5 days ago.  Acid reflux slowly improving with OTC meds.  Disappointed that I could not continue with Otezla.  Even with the lower dosage, my skin was looking much better.",floridahound

I started to develop patches of itchy, dry, red and eventually scaly skin on my legs. There have been a few patches elsewhere but my legs are horrible. Mainly my knees down. I have been working with Otezla for several months as my insurance does not cover hardly any of the costs because my deductible is so high. After a few months my skin is about 60% clearer. I would not say that I have any bad side effects.

22,Otezla,Plaque Psoriasis,6.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"January 5, 2021",9,I broke out with psoriasis about a year ago. It was mild and tried using creams. The steroid cream made me have extremely high blood sugars that were uncontrollable. Nothing was helping. I started Otezla a month ago. A few bouts of diarrhea. Nothing terrible. A few headaches but I am also trying to quit caffeine so that could be the headaches. My problem is the tiredness. I want to sleep all day. An hour or so after taking my pill I literally pass out. Nights I can not sleep. It made my days and nights switch. The scalp psoriasis has cleared but the rest is still itching and scaling as it was. A slight change  for the better in the redness. I have just finished my starter pack. I am hoping and praying for an end to the psoriasis. After reading these reviews I am not as hopeful.,DD
23,Otezla,Plaque Psoriasis,4.0,,"November 27, 2020",6,"Pros- Side effects of apremilast have not seemed particularly debilitating (unlike meds like acitretin)- No need of regular blood tests and checkups- No risk to kidney functionality- It alleviated certains aspects of my psoriasis such as skin dryness and irritability- Can drink alcohol and take over counter medication Cons- Being on the medication seems to have slowed the spread of my guttate psoriasis but has NOT stopped it- My psoriasis patches are still visually very present (despite dryness improving)- I've had psoriasis appear on areas of my skin that it has previously never effected - face, hands, forearms in particular. To remedy this I've upped my use of steroid based ointments which I had hoped to kick- Mild side effects. occasional insomnia + I will need to go to the toilet about an hour after taking a tablet.

I stopped taking it originally because it stopped working. However, once I started taking it again I received the same results as the first time. It has cleared my plaque psoriasis by about 60%, guttate by about 95%, and psoriatic arthritis by maybe 30%. I still have significant joint pain but the clearing of the skin has been nice. I no longer experience side affects but at first I had minor GI upset and headaches that eventually resolved. I hope my results last longer than a year this time.",hbmom12

Never had surgery or anything like that and I’m an extremely active person. Was very scared to take the drug because of all the bad things I read, but then I figured that the only people that write reviews are people that experience bad side effects. Been on a Otezla for three weeks have experienced zero side effects whatsoever but have also experienced zero relief. Psoriasis is still getting worse. Will post another update in the next 10 weeks. I don’t like taking mediation ever, not even when I have a cold. So if this doesn’t work I will probably try a hardcore crash diet. My derm suggested to try gluten free and diary free. Note: I did phototherapy for 3 months and got complete remission, but when I was diagnosed with PsA we decided I needed to address that. Hope this helps anyone seeking help.",31yo

Well was I wrong. After 1 month of runny nose, and heartburn, and lower back pain I had  sore throat and excessive mucus. Saw my PCP and she diagnosed me with upper respiratory infection and started to treat it with antibiotics for 10 days. After 3 days I had difficulty swallowing and felt worse. Re visited the PCP 2 more times and was not getting better. Out of desperation I discontinued the Otezla and after 2 days was much better, no more runny nose, no more heartburn and did not feel depressed by not feeling well. Unfortunately, within 4 days of stopping the Otezla my Psoriasis came back in places I never had it before, so don't know what's next.

There was only a few that were positive. But so far so good. Small headaches but I get them anyways. I think I’ve ran to the bathroom once. I always take medicine after eating. It’s has definitely helped more than hurt. If it changes then I will re review this. But so far I’m happy and I can tell a change in my psoriasis this early. Nothing has helped as much as Otezla the creams are for the birds. CBD Didn’t help. Enbrel didn’t help and it hurt more than helped. The only thing that is relatable to this treatment is tanning bed sessions at the local parlor when I don’t do because that will hurt more than help in the end. So I’m very pleased .

The reasons for taking it was to treat psoriasis of the nails, dactylitis (swollen fingers), and a few stubborn psoriasis patches in the hair line, in ear, and a patch of inverse psoriasis.  Pros: Dactylitis gone in a month, 1 year nail psoriasis improved 60%.  I still have psoriasis patches but they are smaller and less frequent.

Otezla has been a great for my severe psoriasis on the palms of my hands and psoriatic arthritis. I went from 100% coverage with extremely painful lesions, unable to use my hands to 100% clearance, in three weeks. My rheumatologist and I both are amazed with the results. I will put up with the side effects as the massive improvement makes it all worth it. Side effects I've had : headaches /migraines, indigestion, stomach pain, loose stools and nausea. All but headaches have started to subside as of my 3rd week in! Very, very happy here!!",WiarticCat
243,Otezla,Plaque Psoriasis,8.0,,"February 5, 2016",24,I am using Otezla and have been for the past 5 months now. Before taking Otezla I only had plaque psoriasis on my scalp. It would get very dry and hard and when I would scratch my scalp it would bleed. The side effects were nothing too hard to get use to. I have loss some weight but overall the plaque psoriasis has cleared up to where it is more manageable and less scaly. On my body which the only time I had a bad case of psoriasis was when I got mosquito bites on my legs and it turned into red scaly patches all over. I used this sea salt scrub every day when I showered and it went away. Now with using sea salt as a regular monthly regimen all over my body. I only have psoriasis on my scalp.,RJ1974
244,Otezla,Plaque Psoriasis,8.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"February 4, 2016",28,"I've been using Otezla for around three months now.  I had some minor side effects of loose stool and headaches.  They have subsided and don't affect me anymore.  I'm probably 80% clear now.  This time of year I normally have a large increase of lesions.  Not only have the lesions gone away, no new ones have formed.  It will be nice to wear shorts and short sleeve shirts again.  For me, this med has worked great.",MDSX2
245,Otezla,Plaque Psoriasis,1.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"January 22, 2016",16,"Ladies and gentlemen I have been using Otezla for at lease 45 days, at first it was making me run to the bathroom all the time, gave me the runs. Then around a month into the drug I started experiencing headaches after every use. I stopped after about 45 days, I didn't want to be damaging my brain. And after all the symptoms no signs of clearing. Although I haven't had any arthritis. But not worth the headache, literally.",scabby legs
246,Otezla,Plaque Psoriasis,3.0,,"January 6, 2016",14,Minor side effects the first week. I have mild to moderate plaque psoriasis for 30 years. I have been using ultravate cream and an in home light therapy unit with moderate success. I have been using Otezla for almost 4 months with little to no improvement. I will discuss with my doctor and probably continue for another month and then stop.,edwardB harris
247,Otezla,Plaque Psoriasis,9.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"January 4, 2016",21,"Worked fantastically well after a short period of side effects (stomach pain and other gastrointestinal issues). Psoriasis has practically cleared, leaving only pale patches where it had been. Experienced significant weight loss, likely due to the stomach issues.",Donagh

251,Otezla,Plaque Psoriasis,9.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"December 18, 2015",27,"I had plaque psoriasis on most of my body so bad that I could not sleep.  I had the usual cracking, bleeding, etc. and had tried everything with the exception of the injectables.  My health conditions would not allow me to take these.  I started the Otezla and within 3 weeks I was completely clear.  I did have pink patches where they were but it seemed to be a miracle. Now I have been on it for approximately 3 months and all of a sudden I have tiny (very tiny) patches starting up again.  Hopefully this is only temporary.  The side effects have not been bad.  They were aggravating the first few weeks but have lessened to just more bowel movements.  I love this medicine and hope that it will continue to keep me clear.",daisysmother
252,Otezla,Plaque Psoriasis,10.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"December 9, 2015",49,"I am going on six weeks taking Otezla. The results are absolutely amazing compared to all of the various topicals and pills I've tried over the years. I've never been talked into a biologic because the side effects looked worse than the disease. I thought the side effects weren't terrible with Otezla, so I gave it a shot. I wasn't given a starter pack at first, make sure to follow the dosing information. Unlike others, I've experienced absolutely no side effects with almost complete (99%) clear up. Fantastic!!!",RJ54
253,Otezla,Plaque Psoriasis,8.0,,"December 3, 2015",20,"I started on this in September 2014. Went through a very rough 3 months of sickness some weight loss, dizziness, diarrhea, some vomiting. Finally they subsided. Fast forward to 2 weeks ago, I scheduled surgery on my back. The pre surgery nurse told me to stop the medicine, so I did. I get a call this week from another Dr telling me medicine shouldn't effect surgery to continue as usual. So I start back up the same day, because of course both my hands and feet have already started with the blisters and peeling within 2 weeks of not taking the medicine. Now 2nd day back in medicine and I'm not functioning. Headache, can't open my eyes of I do I throw up. I don't know what to think.",Sabrina h
254,Otezla,Plaque Psoriasis,,,"November 29, 2015",38,"Side effects went away completely after a few weeks. My severe skin psoriasis of 30 years is 75% gone. It took 2-3 months to fully work.That 75% clearance is not perfect, but it means so much to me. The monster dandruff is greatly reduced. My scalp is no longer flaming red lizard skin. The plaques on my forehead and neck are now light pink patches. I no longer frantically itch all day. I look healthy! Otezla appears to interfere with the absorption of anti-depressant, or counteract it, but increasing the antidepressant dose a bit fixed the problem for me immediately. Take Otezla with crackers or a half a bagel, it helped calm the stomach. Also ask about the zero co-pay program, it took 5 minutes to register and I save $85 monthly.",Julia2345
255,Otezla,Plaque Psoriasis,7.0,,"November 24, 2015",27,"I've been on Otezla for 4 weeks now. I've had partial clearing on arms and chest. Still have plaques on my legs, but not as itchy as before. Scaling has been reduced. I do have 3-4 bowel movements a day, mainly in morning and afternoon. Have not had nausea or headaches. No depression either. Some minor weight loss. I'm happy with the results so far and hoping that this is the answer. Been dealing with psoriasis for over 40 years now. Started on scalp, but over the past couple of years the legs have been the worst. Been using creams and UV light. The UV light did work at first, but then seemed to be ineffective. Never had the desire to use injections.",tjm55
256,Otezla,Plaque Psoriasis,10.0,,"November 17, 2015",41,I can't believe how great this medicine works. I have had psoriasis since I was 12 years ol. I am now 58 and finally I am clear of the scales and red patches.,Anonymous
257,Otezla,Plaque Psoriasis,10.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"November 5, 2015",84,"I began this medication with a 28 day starter pack and transitioned from there. The first month my side effects were like ""WHOA"" (headache, nausea, gastic distress of epic proportions!) pretty much hell on earth. HOWEVER, here I am 5 months later and for the first time in my life I am completely clear. There is not a plaque to be seen or felt. No itching, no flaking, no cracking! If you're new to this med; don't give up. It gets better!! I'm 5 months into now and I don't have any of the side effects any longer.",DJ in Dover
258,Otezla,Plaque Psoriasis,1.0,,"November 4, 2015",41,"I have been on Otezla for 4 months. At first the side effects were severe and I was feeling sick everyday, but continue with the optimism that it would clear. Those side effects began to die down, but I started to feel more along the lines of depression and anxiety, feelings I had not previously had. All the while, in this 4 months, I have seen zero improvement on my skin, it is the same as if I had not been taken any medication at all. My Dr recommended staying on it for 2 more months to see if there are any results at all. But after having so much optimism when first starting, I have become disheartened and frustrated with both the side effects and the lack of results. I feel worse now than I did 4 months ago.",Ryannn12345678

260,Otezla,Plaque Psoriasis,3.0,,"October 27, 2015",22,took  starter pack for 13 days  and felt like I was in a fog all the time- on the 10th day started to have dizziness- by the 13th day it was so bad  I stopped it.

261,Otezla,Plaque Psoriasis,9.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"September 6, 2015",84,"I have been on this medication for about 6 weeks and it is absolutely amazing. My legs have completely clear. The only sign of my plaque psoriasis is the hyper pigmentation and slowly but surely that is going away as well. I no longer itch either. All of my family and friends have noticed that drastic change in my skin. I even wore a dress for the first time in 4 years today. I could go on forever.

I did every topical, several drugs and even a uv light to treat it. Once it spread to my body I had had enough and was put on this medication. It has almost cleared up my psoriasis completely, and it works fast. However the side effects for me have been horrific. I am terribly nausous and have diahrea literally every time I take it, this subsides within the hour and I can carry on with my day. Yes it's horrible and I've considered stopping the medication; however the fact that I haven't should be proof of just how well it works.",Jord W

267,Otezla,Plaque Psoriasis,2.0,,"July 1, 2015",44,"I have psoriasis and have been on Otezla for 7 months now.  For me it has not worked.  If I stop using any steroid creams for more than 5 days it comes back.    I was told by the Otezla support nurse that if it did not work within 16 weeks it typically would not work.  Side effects I had were nausea, headaches and weight loss.  I never get headaches and while on this medication I got them pretty regularly.  The nausea was tough but I found taking this with food helped.  I really hoped that it would have worked as it seems to be a much safer option that the inject-able options.",Hockey16
268,Otezla,Plaque Psoriasis,5.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"June 20, 2015",87,I have tried otezla twice the first time it cause horrible stomach pain and I had to discontinue it after three weeks. It worked miracles for my skin though almost all clear. I went to GI to get something to counteract the otezla. Went back on it and after two months on it I started having really bad panic attacks. I am not a panic person and have never had anxiety it got so bad I had to stop the pills. However be warned you can not just stop the pills you have to slowly decrease the dose the same way you have to increase in the beginning. I was not told this and ended up in the ER.,Sad and sore
