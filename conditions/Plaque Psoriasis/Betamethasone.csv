0,Betamethasone,Plaque Psoriasis,10.0,,"January 1, 2019",14,"I woke up one morning with signs of Psoriasis on about 30% of my head, on both ears which were 70% covered and random small spots on my chest, arms and back. I tried Psoriasin first, it only helped to alleviate  the itchiness but did nothing for the redness or the regression of the plaque buildup. After dealing with this for about 6 weeks I finally decided to go to the doctor who prescribed me the liquid form of Betaderm (0.1%) for my head to use once a day for 2 weeks and Betaderm (0.05%) ointment which looks like Vaseline for everywhere else but my head that I was to use twice a day for 2 weeks. I am now on day 3, yes only day 3 and the results are absolutely unreal. Within the first 2 days my psoriasis has reduced by roughly 75% on my head. After only one day, plaque buildup stopped in my ears and my head looks so much better that I don't feel embarrassed anymore. Small spots on my arms and chest look about 50% better so far. I would 100% recommend giving this a try.",One Happy Canadian
1,Betamethasone,Plaque Psoriasis,8.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"April 23, 2018",7,"Effective medicine but I am totally in the dark as to how long to leave it on.  Two pharmacists hemmed and hawed about it and even the NP who prescribed it couldn't seem to give me a straight answer on that.  If the medical community isn't sure, who does know?  Not very confidence-instilling, but this gel does work on my palmoplantar psoriasis pretty well.  I leave it on for half an hour and hope that suffices.",Boopy
2,Betamethasone,Plaque Psoriasis,,Taken for less than 1 month,"May 17, 2017",11,So far the ointment is working. I had injections of some steroid first then started this ointment. My elbows are looking 90% better already. My insurance did not cover this drug. Cost me $104.00. Wish it was more affordable.,Ananan
3,Betamethasone,Plaque Psoriasis,10.0,,"November 14, 2016",23,"I had horrible itchy, flakey and weeping ears. I tried every OTC medication and lotion available with no relief. After begging my doctor for something to relieve my pain she prescribed betamethasone and within one day the itch was gone and within 3 days the cracked and bleeding skin was healed. Truly a miracle for me and no more embarrassing ears to hide. 5 stars for this medicine.",Banshee999
4,Betamethasone,Plaque Psoriasis,10.0,Taken for 10 years or more,"March 10, 2016",33,"I have used this off and on for over 15 years. This is the only medication that clears up the psoriasis on my head in a few days. I have made sure to only use it when I need it to keep the effectiveness going for years to come. It doesn't make my hair oily, doesn't sting and keeps me clear for a few days. Love love it! My trusty fix :)",Tiffnotabot
