0,Tremfya,Plaque Psoriasis,10.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"March 31, 2022",0,"For context, I've been suffering for 21 years but in the last 5 it spread to 80% of my body. Head to toe. I started Tremfya December of 2021. Within 3 weeks I started noticing an improvement in the look and the urge to scratch my skin off with a grater had subsided. In 2 months, almost completely gone except a few stubborn spots. Still pink in areas but now 4 months later there are only small pink patches as a reminder. Tremfya has both saved and changed my life. I finally feel like living again instead of waiting impatiently to grow old and die. I haven't noticed any notable side effects.",Emlann
1,Tremfya,Plaque Psoriasis,2.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"March 16, 2022",0,Switched from Siliq to Tremfya due to insurance issues... not by choice. Tremfya by far worst performing injection. Psoriasis spots reappeared on my legs so my derm prescribed a topical. Hadn't used topicals in years. The worst part: upper respiratory infections galore. Four in 2 months with most recent this week resulting in ear infection requiring antibiotics.  Head and body aches common with Tremfya as well. Not a good medicine for me at all.,JCJR
2,Tremfya,Plaque Psoriasis,9.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"February 24, 2022",0,So happy with Tremfya.  Cleared up my skin beautifully except for the palms of my hands.  Still dealing with plaque and multiple skin splits.  Otherwise it's the best out there.  I've not experienced any side effects. Easy to inject.,Loriwo
3,Tremfya,Plaque Psoriasis,6.0,,"November 7, 2021",1,I’m on my fourth week I have not noticed a big difference yet but I was told it takes close to eight weeks to finally start noticing a difference no major side effects as of yet,Jerry
4,Tremfya,Plaque Psoriasis,10.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"October 29, 2021",1,"I have had plaque psoriasis since I was 16. I had to use topicals and as I became an adult my doctor wasn't confident that a biologic wasn't going to affect me adversely there hadn't been enough study so she advised against it back in the day. Recently in the last two year period I started with Humira which started to work for 3 months at work and at the 3-month mark it started to come back, I was so disappointed because I looked good when it was going away I was so happy. So I kept on going next I tried Taltz, I didn't see much with this but the injection was so painful I couldn't tolerate it and I have no idea why it was utterly painful. I had to been allergic to the buffers but as I was not getting any significant results with the it.  Then  I went to Tremfya and oh my goodness it works. I look great I feel great I can go to the beach now without looking at people staring at me!",Back to the bea

6,Tremfya,Plaque Psoriasis,10.0,,"August 3, 2021",7,As a type 1 diabetic that has 15 years of experience with different types of daily injections/pump sites/etc I can say the Tremfya auto injector is the worst injector system I have ever encountered. There’s no needle control and it personally takes a lot of muscle for me to use and it hurts more when you push down enough to inject because the needle digs in. Overall very bad design. However if you dislike seeing needles then it’s good for you because you never see the needle. By the second injection I noticed a big difference in my psoriasis. I’ve had severe plaque psoriasis for years and I just completed my 3rd injection and currently there are no noticeable plaques on my body. I’ve been amazed by the results but I dread each injection. Since being diagnosed with diabetes (at the age of 10) the Tremfya injector is the only needle to ever make me cry and for that I’m pretty frustrated. But for the results I’m getting I’ll absolutely deal with it.,Deb
7,Tremfya,Plaque Psoriasis,10.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"April 11, 2021",7,"It has been brilliant. After almost 50 years with severe psoriasis, I have two small spots, both about the size of a fingernail. AND, best of all, I don't have that incessant itching any more.",Aussie
8,Tremfya,Plaque Psoriasis,8.0,,"January 21, 2021",15,Been on Tremfya for 2 years now. Completely got rid of my psoriasis. I get fever blisters every shot though. Recently had flare up of HPV that I haven’t had in. 23yrs.... same partner nothing new. Thinking Tremfya may have caused this since it can cause herpes simplex to flare up it’s a possibility.,M
9,Tremfya,Plaque Psoriasis,10.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"January 11, 2021",33,"After 2 years of light treatments for my psoriasis that did very little, 1 year of costentyx that got rid of about 30% of plaque psoriasis, that seemed to be coming back at the end. I tried Tremfya and it cleared up all patches of psoriasis on my head, back, knees, thighs, arms and even the redness is gone. I have been using tremfya for one year now and with no noticeable side effects.  I'm completely happy with it.",Rick
10,Tremfya,Plaque Psoriasis,10.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"January 7, 2021",36,"It worked so good it cleared me up 100%. I saved my life and I'm not kidding. I had it so bad I didn't want to live and nothing was helping.  This drug worked like no other. I have tried them all. The best part is that it worked in weeks, not months",dukkie
11,Tremfya,Plaque Psoriasis,9.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"December 24, 2020",22,"My scalp use to be cover with flakes, rough red skin patches on my scalp, behind ears, very itching and embarrassing all the time for 20 years. Try all medical treatments and including sulfate tree shampoo, conditioner. Started using Tremfya in February 2020 saw results within a month. Now I am clear 98% I love it. I hate syringes, but this treatment has clear psoriasis.",Redapplescalp
12,Tremfya,Plaque Psoriasis,10.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"December 24, 2020",12,Amazing results.  100% clear for nearly 2 years now.  Humira did ok-about 70% clearing.  Tremfya has been perfection without side effects.,BC
13,Tremfya,Plaque Psoriasis,10.0,,"October 5, 2020",31,I have been on Humira and Stelera and now Tremfya for a year and a half and it has been the best medication for my plaque Psoriasis! I’m 98% clear from psoriasis for the first time in 37 years!!! I worry in 5 years when I have Medicare and a supplemental it will not be covered! But it’s been amazing for me,Rere
14,Tremfya,Plaque Psoriasis,10.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"August 6, 2020",23,"I had plaque psoriasis for three years after getting a strep throat infection from my daughter. After ointments creams, steroid packs etc (UVB narrow band treatments as well) nothing worked. By the time I had my third Tremfya injection my red patches and scaly skin were gone. It was amazing for me and I was very very frustrated.",KMC
15,Tremfya,Plaque Psoriasis,10.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"August 1, 2020",57,I have used every topical ointment steroid cream and anything over the counter for my plaque psoriasis. I have also been on methotrexate for years no results at all. I switched to Humira for a year. Again no results. I was considered 90% covered in lesions all over my body.  In my dealing with psoriasis it has effected every aspect of my life. I started tremfya and two shots in I’m 100% clear for the first time in 25 years. My whole life has changed. I have not had any side effects at all. Thank You Tremfa!!,Auntjuju
16,Tremfya,Plaque Psoriasis,9.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"April 28, 2020",19,"I have been on Tremfya for four months now with excellent results. Yes I have a few light outbreaks but 90 plus percent better.  Don't give up too quick!  Excellent medication, give it time.",MA
17,Tremfya,Plaque Psoriasis,2.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"April 27, 2020",14,I have been on Tremfya for 8 months now. It cleared me up quite a lot within the first 3 months but sadly I saw no more progress since then. I have never been completely clear within the entire time I've been on it. I've also experienced multiple BAD flare ups while taking it. Sadly.. it just didn't work for me. I was hoping to be fully clear by 6 months but that just wasn't the case. I'm seeing my Dermatologist this week to hopefully swap to something else.,Keziah
18,Tremfya,Plaque Psoriasis,2.0,,"February 21, 2020",19,"I've been on many bios over the last decade.  They switched me to tremfya about a year ago from stelara, and I really wish they hadn't.Tremfya works somewhat for the first and second dose.  After that it goes to 8 weeks and you suffer for at least half of those.  I find it to barely keep psoriasis at bay for the first 3 weeks, then after that you are inflamed and get new spots.Tremfya is absolutely the LEAST effective bio I have used.",Canadianguy
19,Tremfya,Plaque Psoriasis,,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"August 15, 2019",57,"After second shot of Tremfya, both shoulder joints and wrists hurt. Shoulders are worse than wrists. These  pains were not there before. But psoriasis is almost gone with 99 percent clearance. Hopefully, the joint pains will go away. Tremfya research staff could make a real difference by collating information from side-effects database filed both with Tremfya itself, doctors around the country, and the FDA. How long do the joint pains last? What percentage of patients gave up on Tremfya because the pains will not go away? After how long did they give up? For those that stayed with Tremfya, how long do pains typically last? All these important information is hidden in the data. Instead, we have almost zero information with the Tremfya nurses and the dermatologists also have no clue. Patients are literally on their own. Would the responsible party, in this case Tremfya and the FDA please step up to the plate and do their job? Please ask your doctor is not an answer.",GK
20,Tremfya,Plaque Psoriasis,9.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"August 1, 2019",25,"I had incredible, real results within 4 days of my 1st injection. I went from nearly 80% lesion coverage to no lesions at all. I am 3 months in with no side effects. I am so incredibly grateful. I realize this won't be everyone's outcome. For me the risk was well worth it.",Kari
21,Tremfya,Plaque Psoriasis,1.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"December 19, 2018",15,I've been taking Tremfya for just over 6 months now and I haven't seen any improvement. I was really hoping to get the results others were getting because I've heard 90% of users are clear within 90 days. I haven't experienced any side effects really except I've notice recently I've had to urinate a little more often.,Bryan
