0,Meclizine,Motion Sickness,3.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"August 9, 2021",0,I took it 3 hours before bed. I slept for 10 hours which is way longer than normal and I felt exhausted when I woke up. I also had mental fog when for the next 4 hours after I woke up. I then went back to bed for 3 hours. I woke up exhausted again and with mental fog. I literally just spaced out/ nodded off for 3 min while writing this. So hazy. Other people made similar comments. It seems to hit a certain group of people like this. It seems to have dried out my inner ear like the doctor wanted though.,Meclizine can be scary

This worked so well for me. Even during turbulence, I felt great. An added bonus was it seemed to reduce the intensity and frequency of hot flashes that I've been dealing with for the past year!",Vs
5,Meclizine,Motion Sickness,3.0,,"November 12, 2019",10,"Bonine (meclizine):I took Bonine on recommendation before going to Universal Studios as some of the motion simulated rides there make me feel nauseous.  It’s been 2.5 days and I am still so incredibly drowsy.  I’ve been drinking lots of water each day to try and flush it out if my system, but it seems to be taking an incredibly long time to wear off completely.  I won’t be taking this again.

6,Meclizine,Motion Sickness,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"October 15, 2019",5,"I used meclizine for a 10 day boat trip around Kodiak Island AK which has major waves. I definitely get seasick easily, and I wasn’t seasick once! Took 1 pill every eve.  I don’t feel like I had too many side effects-slept heavy, sometimes tired but not bad compared to the regular Dramamine (diphenhydramine). I definitely had  super vivid dreams every night. Others on the boat taking it  shared that same experience. Some of my dreams were kind of obsessive and annoying but still slept good.",Alaska girl

To cut the story short, I faced a miserable 3hrs on the boat, and threw up countless times. Worst antiemetic I've ever used and certainly won't use it again.",Ellejae

OBTW - I have a USCG (US coast guard) license and it specifically prohibits taking Bonine within 24 hours of operating a vessel for hire.  Kinda stupid rule if you ask me.

But I get terrible sea sickness! Even if it's less than a foot! Tried Dramamine and it never worked I would be green in less than an hour!! But then I discovered Bonine ""God Sent"" took 1 pill! The chewable & lasted all day fishing! Not too mention it was rough seas about 2 1/2 to 3 feet!! It was amazing!! So I'm sold definitely a Bonine fan.  It was a game changer for me!

This summer we took a trip to Jordan, Israel, Greece and Italy where we traveled on planes, buses, trains and ferries and rode in taxis, rented cars and jeeps--and camels and donkeys in the desert!--without any trouble at all, as long as we took our Bonine every morning.

12,Meclizine,Motion Sickness,10.0,,"August 21, 2017",11,"Bonine (meclizine):I have been on both a 5 day cruise and just returned from a 7 day cruise. Was introduced to Bonine on first cruise by a friend, also on the cruise, who provided the Bonine for all 4 ""cruisers""; not one got seasick. This last 7 day cruise, I took my 14 yr old daughter who also did not get sick. It did make me a little drowsy so I skipped it one morning we were in port for the day. I forgot to take it when I re-boarded the boat and was feeling woozy and remembered I hadn't taken it that morning. I popped the Bonine and immediately felt fine. Have not heard of any friends being successful with prescribed seasick meds, and not one complaint taking the Bonine. Thank you Bonine for a fabulous 7 days!",VickieJ.
13,Meclizine,Motion Sickness,2.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"July 26, 2017",3,"Been dealing with motion sick type issues for years. Meclizine does not work, regardless of the dosage- even if taken at the first onset of symptoms. It has been totally useless for me. In fact, the only thing that does work is Diphenhydramine.  Dramamine is NOT the same. It may have Diphenhydramine in it but they combine it with chlorotheophylline to reduce the sedative effects. It must alter the entire chemistry of it or something. They rename the active ingredient Dimenhydrinate, much less effective than Diphenhydramine or Benedryl... Anyways, I gave the Meclizine two stars because I never notice any adverse effects from it despite being very sensitive to medications...  I know some people it works for, just not me.",Anonymous

The first time out was a complete failure with severe nausea and vomiting accompanied by diarrhea. The second time was a little better, no diarrhea and limited vomiting but quite acute nausea.

23,Meclizine,Motion Sickness,9.0,,"March 3, 2015",36,"Bonine (meclizine):I learned to sail keelboats 8 years ago.  I love it, but am prone to seasickness. I tried ginger initially but that was ineffective.  Then a friend suggested Bonine and I have used it ever since.  I don't feel drowsy while sailing, but on the drive home after sailing and all the next day I can be very drowsy.  To combat the drowsiness I tried reducing my dose, I now take 1/3-1/2 a tablet each time I go out (once or twice a week), increasing the dose up to 1-1/2 tablets if I expect rough seas.  Over the 7 years of twice a week use, I have only had trouble twice in stormy 6 ft seas.  Highly recommend, but figure out your best dose.   I have taken it for up to 10 days continuously without ill effects.",dlb333

I've been taking it for about 2 years now for car rides longer than an hour and plane rides.  For me, it only works if I take it at least an hour before travel.  If I take it when I'm already sick, it only works about 50% for me.  This wonderful medicine has allowed me to travel.  Before, I used to dread going any distance.  I do get a little bit drowsy, but not to the point where I cannot function.  I can still work, sight see, etc.  I sleep wonderfully when I'm on it!",Karen3339

The doctor gave me meclizine which really helped, still had some turbulence in the stomach so I purchased ""Motion Ease"" oils (a drop behind each ear) when the seas were really rough!

Although it makes me a little sleepy, it's not so bad that it affects what I do.  It just makes it a little hard to get up in the morning- takes me a little longer to feel ""awake"".  Otherwise, I usually feel very good with no nausea.  I used it on a *very* rough boat ride once and although I never threw up, I was nauseous for the last half of the trip.

Within hours I felt great and now I start taking meclizine the day before we sail until the day after we get home.
