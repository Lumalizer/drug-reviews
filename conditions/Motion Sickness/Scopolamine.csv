1,Scopolamine,Motion Sickness,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"February 15, 2022",0,"Went on a cruise years ago, very calm seas, got extreme motion sickness for two days until someone gave me a patch. Got total relief within one hour! Have been on numerous cruises since including one that was in violent seas and never got sick while wearing the patch. Causes a little dry mouth and slight blurred vision. Recently the patch has been causing the skin under it to become extremely itchy and burny feeling and it gets raised. I will try cortisone cream on it. Not sure if I get an after effect when removing it or I just have jet lag! It has saved me from sleeping through my cruises due to the vertigo feeling I get without the patch! Hoping I can get the itching under control!",On board
2,Scopolamine,Motion Sickness,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"February 12, 2022",0,I was given this drug for abdominal surgery. As a patch. Within 6 hours I couldn’t see texts on my phone. Took the patch off 24 hours ago and still can’t see close letters. The blurry vision is terrible. Avoid at all costs.,Maggie

4,Scopolamine,Motion Sickness,10.0,Taken for 5 to 10 years,"December 19, 2021",0,"I have experience really bad motion sickness on planes. My blood pressure dips, I start perspiring, I get nausea and finally throw up. My physician recommended scolpolamine patch. I tried it and thank goodness all symptoms gone. I will not fly without it, won’t cruise will put it. I couldn’t even stand up on the plane with panic that the symptoms would start because even the second time without the patch I had very similar symptoms and it is horrible. I rather have some dry mouth then the other feelings. After I arrive I wait about 4-8 hrs and I remove the patch and hydrate a lot.  It may not be for everyone but like others Bonnie and Dramamine does not do anything.",A must
5,Scopolamine,Motion Sickness,5.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"August 27, 2021",0,"I used two Scopolamine patches over the course of eight days and avoided motion sickness during my vacation. After taking the patch off- I have become miserably sick.  Vomiting, nausea, dizziness, and headaches. I can't even get out of bed and its been three days!  I have used this medication before for single day events - a fishing trip, snorkeling and long bus rides successfully with no side effects- but only left the patch on for the duration of the event- less than 12  hours.  I will never leave a patch on for more than a day again. I have never felt so sick in my life!! This medication does what it is supposed to but the withdrawals are worse than any motion sickness one could possibly have.",Danielle
6,Scopolamine,Motion Sickness,1.0,,"June 10, 2021",0,"Transderm-Scop (scopolamine):I used the patch for 5 days before taking it off because it didn’t help nausea and I was starting to get blurry vision. 2 days later, I was dealing w/ significantly worse nausea than I had when I was prescribed the drug, my vision was blurrier, had a strong, painful sensitivity to light, felt like my eyes were burning. My dr failed to disclose withdrawal & adverse side effects of the medication. I feared I was going blind and I began forgetting things & feeling disoriented & dizzy. Now it’s been a week since I stopped and I haven’t been able to keep food down in 6 days. This may be a safe drug for most people—my reaction to this medication isn't common, but it’s an intense drug & can cause debilitating symptoms for weeks after using the patch for only days. Be sure you trust your prescribing doc and that he or she discloses possible side effects and risk factors because I assure you that you will prefer motion sickness over the withdrawal symptoms of this medication",Shtiknit

As directed, I placed the patch behind my right ear hours before departure. I ended up not going due to my 2nd Moderna vaccine I received on Thursday was acting up Friday morning. I took the patch off and didn’t feel any negative effects. On Saturday night I went out with friends and had a few cocktails. I put the patch on what a mistake. I took it off last night cause I forgot it was on and now I’m going through a bunch of withdrawals symptoms such as dizziness, confusion, dry mouth. My cousin who is a doctor said it shouldn’t last too much longer. I should be better by the morning or later afternoon. Regardless, never taking this patch again.",Timmy

Don’t know what they have changed with ingredients/dosage but the last ones I had made me feel really ill whilst using and I had terrible balance, motion sickness after I came off the ship & no longer had the patch on which lasted for a week.

10,Scopolamine,Motion Sickness,9.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"December 29, 2020",0,I suffer from motion sickness since I was a child. Especially when I am at sea on a boat I can not last more than 30 minutes without getting sick and vomit. These patches are great. It was the only thing that worked for me. I was really surprised to be honest that it worked so well. About the side effects I only notice some dizziness but that is it. I would use it again in the future,Leni
11,Scopolamine,Motion Sickness,1.0,,"December 18, 2020",9,"I would give scopolamine a zero if it was an option and I definitely think this drug should be banned. I was prescribed this medication for motion sickness and advised to keep the patch on for 72 hours. The side effects I experienced were dizziness, fatigue, cognitive issues and it didn’t even stop the motion sickness. The worst side effect I experienced was blurred vision that never went away even after I removed the patch. I ended up having to get glasses and now even 11 months later my vision is still deteriorating so much that I will be having to have another exam soon to increase my prescription. DO NOT RECOMMEND.",Kinnon
12,Scopolamine,Motion Sickness,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"November 13, 2020",6,I’m so glad I got worried and decided to always look up whatever is being put into my body. I had the patch on for a couple of hours before took it off and then tried it on again 1 hour after taking it off. I called my pharmacy and complained of racing heart and not really being able to see. So they advised that I take it off and keep it off. I took it off and my memory went to crap a couple of hours later with some dizziness and difficulties reading. I don’t know what’s going to happen to me now but I hope my withdrawals will be nonexistent or only a week at the most. This is why I just never trust anyone automatically and you shouldn’t either. Reading all these stories makes me feel VERY lucky that I took it off after about 4 hours of having it on.,Nate Grey
13,Scopolamine,Motion Sickness,3.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"September 7, 2020",9,"I used this drug for the first time almost a year ago while traveling from the US to Spain, and back again. It was wonderful and I had no vertigo or motion sickness. No side effects. I used it again (2 patches) within the last week and have had severe blurry vision for things close up, to where I can’t see what’s on my phone screen or read off of paper. I have also had really bad dry mouth. While it works well for me for the intended use, the blurred vision is very bad and I will not use the patch again.",Itzme
14,Scopolamine,Motion Sickness,4.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"April 5, 2020",6,I have severe vertigo and meclizine and physical therapy weren't doing the trick so my doctor prescribed me the patches... (please now i'm still being sent to different specialists to treat this). I only lasted 2 days with the patch. My mouth and throat were EXTREMELY dry. To the point where it would bother me when I breathed and my teeth were starting to hurt from how dry my mouth was. I even bought dry mouth candies to suck on and it didn't do the trick. I was so fed up I took off the patch. Will be calling my doctor soon to see if there is something else I can get because I just felt terrible. My body was also feeling weak. Maybe i'll try to tough it out another day but first I would like my saliva back. My vertigo wasn't as bad but I would still get it.,Kitten
15,Scopolamine,Motion Sickness,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"March 28, 2020",4,"Took these scopolamine patches on a cruise.  After about 6 hours of applying the patch I had a dry cough, dry mouth.  After day 1 the cough worsened, also had body aches, confusion and nothing tasted good. By day 2 all of the above symptoms worsened. Day 3 took it off and continues to feel badly until I arrived home 5 days later.  I do not recommend this patch particularly if you are older, they are quite scary.",gigi

Took for a 7 day cruise first couple days were ok, 3rd day started hallucinating, dry mouth, dialated pupils. Was also taking anti histamines for allergies, the side effects are far worse than actual motion sick. by day 5 couldn't swallow, was dehydrated, went to cruise doctor, and had to get epi-pen'd. ($3900 visit) This was an extreme reaction, but please beware and don't give to children. Took a couple weeks to get over the symptoms, by far the worst drug I've ever taken.",sbeaches
17,Scopolamine,Motion Sickness,3.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"February 11, 2020",5,"My husband and I used these scopolamine patches for a 6 day cruise. They worked great for him (and he usually gets terrible motion sickness), but I experienced awful side effects. I was dizzy all the time (I almost fell down the stairs it was so bad), had cotton mouth really bad, and my pupils were extremely dilated. As a result, I was super light sensitive and couldn't read anything. I took the patch off after 24 hours, and it took another 12-16 hours for the blurred vision to subside. I still felt dizzy for another 24 hours or so. Fortunately, I didn't get seasick on the cruise, and neither did my husband, so I guess they work. I just don't think I'll try them again. The side effects were not worth it to me!",Swedgehammer
18,Scopolamine,Motion Sickness,7.0,,"February 3, 2020",3,"Used the patch for a 2 week trip to Thailand including bumpy car/bus/ferry rides. I had no side effects at all for the first 6 days and it worked wonders! I applied the patches in the evening before going to bed, but on the 3rd patch (day 6) I applied it in the morning. I felt tired and dizzy with some strange eye dilations. realized it was probably the patch making me feel strange I removed it as the bumpiest parts of my trip were over. For a little less than 24 hours the dizziness and anxiety (likely from reading all these reviews) continued, and I wasn’t hungry but no vomiting or anything close to what I’ve read in other reviews. After 24 hours from removing the patch I felt completely normal. Drank LOTS of fluids throughout the day and keeping moving although I would have preferred to stay lying down. It was our last day of the trip so we continued our plans of sightseeing which helped take my mind off the side effects and I felt normal much quicker than I expected.",Chlo

I didn't get sick but had extreme blurred vision, dry mouth and felt like I didn't have ""higher brain function"".  I ""couldn't think"".  I was like a zombie.  I felt like I couldn't plan simple chains of thoughts, low motivation and just did not feel like myself.  Upon taking it off I got nausea, my mind felt numb, fatigue and I'm on day four of not feeling normal.  It's sorta scary.  I'm glad I didn't have to immediately go back to work because I seriously could not think straight.  I think the cons outweigh the pros and maybe next time I'll try a different product.",Frip
24,Scopolamine,Motion Sickness,6.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"August 26, 2019",5,"I was going on a trip to France and was proscribed the scopolamine patch for motion sickness. I have Meniere's disease that makes any travel difficult. When traveling I usually take large doses of meclizine, which controls the nausea but I end up either sleeping or barely functioning.  The patch was a miracle! I was not only able to take several flights but also fully enjoy riding in a car in France, Italy and Switzerland through the Alps! The only thing I wish I had known about is the debilitating withdrawal that I discovered when I attempted to go back to work the day after removing the patch.  I am on day 4 of only being able to stand for minutes at a time before feeling like I am going to either throw up or pass out. I am on meclizine and hoping it passes soon. I wouldn't change using the patch knowing what I do now but I would have managed my schedule to allow some recovery time.  It was the trip of a lifetime.",Mel

The cruise down and back up the Sound was fine, and I probably didn't need any kind of motion sickness medication for that.  But they went out into the Tasman Sea for about 1/2 hour.  It was a beautiful, sunny autumn day, but it became clear within 3-4 minutes that the Transderm-Scop was not working at all in open ocean waters...which is where I really needed this to work.

30,Scopolamine,Motion Sickness,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"May 27, 2019",4,"Transderm-Scop (scopolamine):This drug completely changed my experience of deep sea fishing trips and being on the boat in general. I applied the patch before bed so that it would be in full effect by the next morning. Only side effects upon waking were mild imbalance and incoordination, but this went away after eating a breakfast sandwich and coffee. I only began to feel a little sleepy/drowsy on the way home, which I believe is pretty normal for anyone exposed to that much motion at one time (the sunburn, heat, and humidity I’m sure exacerbated it). Through all of this, the patch stayed on great but I did not swim. I’m 5’1 123 lb 22 year old female and the dosing was fine for me.  Do not cut the patch in half if you feel this to be necessary (which it may be if you are below 100 lbs like my friend who did experience side effects). Please just keep half of the backing on the patch to seal the other side, then use surgical tape from your first aide kit to make sure that it doesn't flop around.",Ann
31,Scopolamine,Motion Sickness,8.0,,"April 18, 2019",2,"I went offshore fishing recently and am terribly prone to motion sickness, so I asked my doc to prescribe the scopolamine patch and tried it for the first time.  Overall the experience was great and worked well but I should have adjusted my timing a little better.  I put the patch on that morning when I woke up at 6am and my fishing charter started at 8am.  The medication states it needs up to four hrs to start really working and I could tell, definitely got a little sick in the morning, but that was my fault, though luckily I didn’t throw up.  By the afternoon fishing was amazing, no motion sickness at all.  I was really impressed and will use again!!!",Veezy

It did help with the motion sickness but I had such a dry mouth I couldn't enjoy the food and it affected my vision so I couldn't see to read anything. I ended up going without my glasses and contacts which meant I could see up close but not far away.  After taking the patch off I had severe nausea and dizziness, all I could do for 2 days was sleep. I lost 10lbs in 3 days and still feel nauseous.  This patch needs to come with more information on the withdrawal symptoms.

I tried the Transderm-Scop patch to help with motion sickness on thrill rides.  First patch fell off that night, so I placed a new patch on the following morning and wore it for 1 1/2 days.  I took it off mid-day as it was irritating my skin.  Up to that point I was very pleased to be nausea free.  Things changed about 8 hours after taking off the patch.  Stationary objects in my house began to twist and turn very slowly.  For example, my computer monitor appeared to turn my direction, and my ceiling fan blades moved like octopus tentacles. I looked up side effects and read that it can cause hallucinations. Unfortunately, it is still happening 12 hrs later.  Now my pupils are slightly dilated, and I'm seeing double, along with slight nausea and a headache. The effectiveness of the medication during use does not outweigh these side effects.

45,Scopolamine,Motion Sickness,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"March 23, 2018",8,"Did it work for motion sickness? Yes. Did it rob me of my far-sighted vision? Yes. Was it worth it? No! I used to have perfect far-sighted vision, but as soon as an anaesthesiologist put on a Scop patch before my foot surgery, I lost my close-up vision that very same day. But here's the strange thing: my close-up vision only goes blurry when I wear my glasses or contact lenses for nearsightedness. When I take off my glasses, my farsighted vision is okay.
