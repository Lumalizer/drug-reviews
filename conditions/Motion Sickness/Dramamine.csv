0,Dramamine,Motion Sickness,10,Taken for less than 1 month,"August 25, 2021",0,"This is AMAZING.  My 4 year old son started to get car sick as he got older, when we would have to drive any distance longer than 20 minutes he would get nauseous and throw up.  After one particularly bad road trip where we had to stop on four separate occasions due to him throwing up, I finally did some research into some sort of medicine that would help.  I tried the chewable kid's dramamine and although he still complained a few times about his stomach hurting, he never threw up and was quickly back to his usual self.",Anonymous

2,Dramamine,Motion Sickness,10,,"December 1, 2020",31,"I've had moderate motion sickness for almost my entire life, and it's only gotten worse into adulthood. I have Generalized Anxiety and Panic disorders on top of being extremely emetophobic (fear of nausea/vomiting), so you can imagine how those play into the motion sickness and snowball it from there. When my Panic Disorder was at its worst, I would have to take two dramamine and two .5mg xanax just to get through a 2-hour car ride without vomiting. I'd literally have to sedate myself to go anywhere that wasn't less than 15 minutes from where I lived.Nowadays, any time I go out or feel nauseous, I pop 1-2 dramamine depending on the severity. It does away with the nausea in roughly a half hour and calms me down too.Honestly don't know where I'd be without dramamine (original formula). It allows me to visit my family, and allows me to actually enjoy car rides rather than sit hyperventilating or hanging my head out of the window like a sick dog. Thank you dramamine!",JessW
3,Dramamine,Motion Sickness,7,,"October 21, 2019",5,I’ll be going on a 1 hour drive with my best friend to Great Wolf Lodge and I’m afraid of getting carsick!! So I texted my mom about this and she’s buying me the medicine. Though I hate being in cars with too much motion it makes me feel sick a lot. But I’m pretty sure I’ll forget all about the sickness once I go on slides and go swimming:),Anonymous
4,Dramamine,Motion Sickness,3,Taken for less than 1 month,"August 7, 2019",15,"I took a full pill for a precaution  for sea sickness before going on whale watch.  I don't usually get sea sick but said what the heck since the Dramamine box said non drowsy.It is now 24 hours later and i am still completely out of it.  I had to have someone drive my car home and I fell asleep in the car.  I came home and slept 3 hours, then went to dinner and went to bed after and slept for about 10 hrs.  Still do not feel like me.  So bummed! At least sea sickness is short term.",whalewatcher
5,Dramamine,Motion Sickness,10,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"June 11, 2018",13,"I have always been a roller coaster junkie, but as I've grown up, my equilibrium isn't the same.  I'm almost 51, but can take one of these and go on all the rides with my kids that I used to, and I feel great.  It also doesn't make me as tired as the other stuff.  I can't wait to try it on a plane.  Great product!",Manicgrey
6,Dramamine,Motion Sickness,10,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"April 17, 2018",27,"I have been seriously dizzy since Jan 2018. Dramamine restores me,  so I can work and live  the only problem is I take quite a few tabs a day. But for 3 and a half months I can't handle the dizziness!!  Dramamine took away my dizzy spells,  nausea and vomiting!   I feel human again.",Mm
7,Dramamine,Motion Sickness,10,,"December 31, 2016",15,I recently bought the PS4 VR helmet. Almost every game made me motion sick. I tried Dramamine by taking it one hour before playing. Not one game bothered me at all. I played four straight hours and had a blast. I have only tried this once and had 100% success. Today I am giving it a go again!,Ljcowned
8,Dramamine,Motion Sickness,1,Taken for less than 1 month,"November 28, 2016",14,"I've taking dramamine a couple of times with good results however the other day I took it and it was a disaster.  I usually experience agitation and dizziness while being a passenger in a car and it usually dulls it but, this time... it made my symptoms substantially worst I developed sensitivity to light , sound , and even temperature felt more intense and that was in addition to the agitation and dizziness.  Please use with caution.",Concernedgal
9,Dramamine,Motion Sickness,10,,"August 28, 2016",26,Works excellent. Went on. Whale watch with family. Took it 1 hour before boat trip and it worked awesome. I Even was able to have food on the boat with no nausea.,KF2214
10,Dramamine,Motion Sickness,10,,"August 26, 2016",16,"I take this for motion sickness, as well as occasional nausea. It works beautifully. I'm able to go on longer road trips and boats without being bothered by motion. And not only do I feel well physically, but my mind is at ease knowing that I don't really have to worry about it. I also appreciate the fact that it's widely available and relatively inexpensive. I usually buy the generic version, but I find that it works just as well.",Annie Rose
11,Dramamine,Motion Sickness,10,,"August 22, 2016",10,I have taken Dramamine every day of my adultLife. I have suffered from motion sickness my entire life and it is not unusual for me to become motion sick from working on the computer if I haven't taken a Dramamine yet. I recently noticed yellowing of my skin and eyes. My doctor Ordered blood work and I was diagnosed with Hepatitis A. there is no reason I would have contracted hepatitis. Is there a correlation with Dramamine?,Anonymous
12,Dramamine,Motion Sickness,9,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"August 17, 2016",11,I enjoy sport fishing. most of the time about 3 to 4 days out at sea on a 30footer boat which could rocks severally during storms. to help myself from being seasick/motion-sickness I frequently take 1 NOVOMIT pill every 8-9 hourly. I am in my mid 40s and I felt the pills do really help. it would cost abt USD$4 per box/8pills from pharmacy. hope these information is useful.,LouisKeiv
13,Dramamine,Motion Sickness,10,,"February 23, 2016",48,We use Dramamine prior to fishing trips.  However an old sea captain told me to take one pill the night before and then another the morning of the trip.  This way it really gets in your system.  It works!,Tom M.
14,Dramamine,Motion Sickness,10,,"October 5, 2015",32,I am so glad I found this! I've been dealing with motion sickness for years. It was almost impossible for me to ride in the backseat of a car before this medication. I first used Dramamine for a 4 hour road trip in a large van. I was so nervous about getting motion sickness I almost did go. I took 2 pills about 30 minutes before and it completely kept the sickness away! It did make me tired and I ended up taking a little nap but thats better than nausea. I can do everything I couldn't do before in a car from reading to having a normal conversation.,Marilynalexa
15,Dramamine,Motion Sickness,10,,"July 30, 2015",42,"This is amazing! I've been struggling with motion sickness, and its gotten worse as I got older. I took this on a 3 hour drive to San Diego and 3 hour drive back, and I was feeling better than ever! It seems to help with anxiety as well, I forgot how it felt to just be normal. I'm always nauseous, so its a refreshing feeling to not feel anything on the drive. I don't get sleepy that easily so the drowsiness doesn't kick in til later, but this is amazing I recommend. Its good to have trust with a medication because it'll ease your mind on the trip you're going to take, and thats what I have with dramamine.",aliengirlkaren

Not only did I not experience any nausea, but it knocked me out for my two hour flight! I fell asleep while people were still boarding and woke up when the plane hit the ground again. Amazing!",Big Rojo
18,Dramamine,Motion Sickness,10,,"February 17, 2015",34,Amazing. Helps with my serve nausea and helps me sleep. It's better if you take it 30 minutes before the trip. And also helps with anxiety it relaxes you.,Anonymous
19,Dramamine,Motion Sickness,9,,"December 24, 2014",30,"I use this for both motion sickness and severe migraines, I'm 25 years old and this actually takes away the hurt from noise, light, touch and yes dizziness and vomiting. I can actually move and participate with my family this Christmas. Rarely do I mix it, if anything I just take max dosage recommended.",NMama25

23,Dramamine,Motion Sickness,10,,"March 7, 2011",46,"I have such a hard time with motion sickness, so I am always sure to bring Dramamine along with me for flights, cruises, etc. I do not recommend the non-drowsy formula, however because it does not work for me. I will take drowsiness over nausea any day!",Christine P.
24,Dramamine,Motion Sickness,9,,"August 22, 2010",33,"I've taken this for motion sickness and it absolutely does help with preventing the nausea. When on Dramamine, I will occasionally get a hint of it - or maybe it's just the recognition that certain conditions should be making me sick. Either way, nothing close to what I would experience when I not medicating. The only critique I have to offer is the drowsiness. Desperately wishing to lay down and close my eyes, which can happen on Dramamine, is inconvenient if it's not the type of trip I want to sleep through.",Anonymous
25,Dramamine,Motion Sickness,8,,"March 17, 2010",44,"I have been taking dramamine for years (since I was a child) to prevent my terrible motion sickness. It works incredibly well at keeping me from getting nauseated. My only problem with it is that it makes me so drowsy! If it is a shortish flight or bus ride, I still get nauseous but don't always want to take a dramamine because I'll be so drowsy once arriving at my destination. A 4+ hour flight/bus/boat though, and dramamine is for sure the way to go, particularly if it is overnight travel and you will be wanting to sleep anyway.",kayling05
26,Dramamine,Motion Sickness,10,,"July 8, 2009",64,"I had a 5 hour flight trip, I got Dramamine and it made me so relaxed, I fell asleep. When I woke up we were about to land. It helped me with anxiety too.",YuyiBoo
27,Dramamine,Motion Sickness,10,,"April 24, 2009",35,This is the only one that works for me and it really does work half an hour after taking it.  This is important for me as our trips out in our boat are very spur of the moment.  Sadly I can no longer get this is the UK.,Jackanory
