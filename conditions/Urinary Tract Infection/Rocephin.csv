1,Rocephin,Urinary Tract Infection,10.0,,"December 1, 2020",5,"I had a UTI come back 3 weeks after taking Bactrim Sulphate for 3 days and I woke in the middle of the night with sweats and the painful urgency to go pee.  It was so bad that I couldn't wait to see my doctor the next day.  I went to the E.R. at midnight and after receiving treatment I was given an injectio  of Rocephin 1 MG, with a written prescription for a 7 day antibiotic.  LISTEN to me when I tell you this injection was like Satan slapping me on my rear and saying enjoy the next 10 minutes of fire.   It hurt going in and hurt so bad like my skin was melting for 10 minutes afterwards.  But IT WORKED, when I got up the next morning at 6 am, the urgency to pee was gone and I had no pain. The injection site was very tender.",AngelGirl308

Unfortunately I cannot take oral medication due to my stomach  sensitivity, oral medication produce acid reflex on me extremely bad. Then I went to the ER last October I was admitted at hospital.   I was giving Rocephin IV  only 1 does it worked and I was sent home. I was suppose to get five days oral treatment but that did not happen.

3,Rocephin,Urinary Tract Infection,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"August 3, 2020",10,"This is my 3rd UTI in an annual year. One in Oct of 2019, May 2020 and Aug 2020. I woke up at 2 am 2 days ago feeling that all so familiar feeling. By 1pm Sunday I headed to the ER. I started urinating blood, passing clots and my pelvic area was killing me! A UTI causes INTENSE pain, I would birth my 4 children all over again! Doc did a phone call appt (due to covid) today and he said I am perimenopausal(sp) at 38 years old :/. My estrogen is funky so that could def be a culprit. I did have the rocephin shot last night, but it's taking a bit longer to COMPLETELY go away vs the last 2x. I am TERRIFIED of getting another UTI. My doc suggested a natural supplement call de mannose. Anyone taking this? I have to order it, drug store was out. Apparently it's a preventative supplement for UTI's. All I know is that the pain of a UTI is forever traumatizing! The shot hurts, yes, but SO worth the relief. I would recommend it to anyone.",Skky

After 2 days of back pain and abdominal pain I finally went to my Dr.  They wrote a prescription for Ciprofloxacin and also gave me 2 Rocephin injections in my butt.  Having been diagnosed with Spina Bifida while still in my Mother's womb in 1984, I've had many Urinary Tract Infections.

10,Rocephin,Urinary Tract Infection,9.0,,"September 30, 2019",23,Second time posting hoping it might help someone.  Had symptoms of UTI on Friday.  Not happy all weekend.  Got into doctor this morning and had shot. I still hate getting two shots in my bottom but my doctor also insists on giving me a B12 shot when I see him because I am slightly anemic.  I am not sure if it is because I am skinny but Rocephin burns like heck and I am almost in tears getting it.  Maybe I am just a wimp but I don’t like needles getting stuck in me and Rocephin is the worst!   It it is now around 3:00 and I have no symptoms.  It works and even though I dreaded the shot all weekend  I am glad I got it.,Amy

My back was hurting so bad I couldn't hardly walk along with running a fever and feeling nauseous. Ended up going to the ER they gave me the Rocephin shot and within an hour I promise I could pee without it burning and the blood clots I was passing had stopped, so this was a miracle medicine to me.

Had such a bad one, plus pain in my back and I felt like the Bactrim was making me feel awful too. I ended up going to ER because I have only 1 kidney and can’t allow a kidney infection to set it. I got a  Rocephin IV and it is now 9 hrs later and I feel so much better! It's still soon to say it completely cured it, but I am actually having real relief for the first time in 5 days.

14,Rocephin,Urinary Tract Infection,10.0,,"July 3, 2018",18,"Had UTI diagnosed over a month ago, given cipro. Never felt quite over the UTI. Ended up getting bactrim, UTI started raging again. Went back to doc  and requested rocephin. Received shot and was 99% better within hours. Seeing my own PCP in 2 days, may get another shot.  I'm working away from home and I found out I’m resistant to many antibiotics now so rocephin saved me from permanent kidney damage :)",Sherry

16,Rocephin,Urinary Tract Infection,5.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"May 31, 2018",11,"I was given the shot today, after having finished a 7 day antibiotic which did not help my UTI at all. After reading the reviews I see most peoples symptoms cleared within 4-6hrs however I cannot say the same. I hope by the time I wake up I notice a difference.

17,Rocephin,Urinary Tract Infection,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"May 19, 2018",15,"I went to Convenient Care late this morning. I have been having problems with urinating all week. I was running to the bathroom with extreme urgency to pee every 15 minutes or so only to urinate a small amount. My back had started hurting in a different area than usual a few days ago and yesterday my legs ached so bad I could barely stand it. I was nauseated also. Anyways, at the Convenient Care they checked me in and I had a temperature they asked for a urine sample so I gave them one. All morning I have been passing small clot like mucous pieces of blood while urinating. I have never had an injection before for my bladder infections but this morning I received  my first  Rocephin. I had it around noon and by 4:30 I was already starting to feel better!  They also gave Cipro for 10 days so I  hope that doesn’t make me feel too sick because I’m feeling a lot better right now. Still achy but not burning when I urinate.",Buttons
18,Rocephin,Urinary Tract Infection,9.0,,"March 4, 2018",16,"Tried posting this on my iPad yesterday and the day before but it did not seem to post. I have been getting Rocephin injections for UTIs for about 10 years.  Initially after trying pill antibiotics over a over with little success, my OB recommended the shot.  I am extremely needle phobic and was very reluctant to agree to a shot in my butt, but convinced myself to suck it up.   First it is a little embarrassing to be bent over a table with a bare butt , next the shot really hurts and burns. Your butt is sore or about 1 hour afterward. But it works. A few days ago I had symptoms of a UTI and ignored them.  My husband convinced me to stop being a baby and go get the shot! I finally gave in and saw my doctor. I received one rocephin injection in my right cheek and a B12 shot in my other butt cheek.  5-6 hours later I felt fine although my bottom is still a little sore.  I need to get over this fear of needles!  Don't watch when they prepare it.  But I would recommend this shot.",Amy

I was seen 4 days ago for which I thought was a UTI. It was extremely painful and they prescribed be Bactrim, a 3 day supply. After taking 3 pills I was getting worse. My doctor finally called me back and wanted me in right away. I had literally no control over my bladder. I was in excruciating pain, and couldn't help but cry. The doctor told me I had tested positive for an STD as well as a UTI and I was on the wrong medication. I was given the Rocephin shot and prescribed another antiobiotic. It is now day 2 since the shot and I feel much better. I'm still in some pain but I'm hoping it goes away soon!",Li ko

Azo doesn't even take a little of the pain away...mine are always terrible! Uti hit me hard yesterday and I went to the clinic I asked for this shot based on people on the Internet saying it helped so fast. It's true.

Doctor first prescribed Macro. Those were the worst 3 days ever. I could not stop throwing up. The smell of food made me nauseous. I was weak and did not move from the bed for 3 day which is not like me at all. I am a very active person. I called the on-call doctor on Sunday night and she told me to stop taking Macro and to come in tomorrow to get the Rocephin shot. I have to say just from one day of being off Macro I already feel better but not 100%. I took the Rocephin shot and started to feel better little by little after 3 hours.

The injection itself was not any worse than any other I've received, but as the medicine starts making its way into the body it becomes very uncomfortable. It feels very bruised and knotty at the injection site. However, I know this medicine works very well for this condition as I've had this twice previously, otherwise I would not put myself through the discomfort. It is only painful from about 2-3 minutes following the injection up to about 30 minutes following when the pain wears down to barely noticeable except when the area is touched.  Its highly worth the brief pain and discomfort.  I always feel much better within 24 hours following the shot.",Anonymous
