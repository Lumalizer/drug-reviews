0,Levaquin,Urinary Tract Infection,7.0,,"January 15, 2021",2,"I only took one pill.Within minutes I had a reaction.One dose was enough to make my face red as a tomato, sore all over, and light hallucinations. Doctor said 95% have no problem. But, I notice in these reviews 41% were negative. It did clear up my infection though!  Surprised it’s still on the market.",Beafraid

2,Levaquin,Urinary Tract Infection,1.0,,"November 16, 2019",19,"2015, 2x/day for 10 days for first ever UTI.Day 3, woke up very sore all over,got worse each day.Days 6&7, misery. Every single joint and tendon in my entire body felt like it had been put through a paper shredder. I couldn't even walk. It wasn't until that day that I read that it was black boxed (had never even heard of that before). I also read that if you experience any of these side effects, to stop taking it immediately. So I should've stopped on day 3 when I already felt hit by a truck. 0 warning from doctor or pharmacy. 6 months before I could lift my left arm due to the pain in my shoulder. 5 years later, and I still have severe joint pain in my knees, hips, and back. The worst is my hands, which ache so bad, which is devastating as an artist. I'm 35, yet I feel 90. This poison needs to be taken off the market, and doctors and pharmacists need to be more responsible if they do prescribe it, and at the very least, warn patients of the risks. I should've had the choice.",Regret
3,Levaquin,Urinary Tract Infection,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"October 24, 2019",21,Less than a year ago I was a healthy athletic person had a full-time physical job. After 4 days on this medication I began to suffer side effects and quit taking it. Now my life is ruined. I can't walk I'm going blind and deaf and I live in constant pain as if somebody took a sledgehammer and pounded my whole lower body and my condition is worsening everyday . The side effects of fluoroquinolone poisoning are horrible way of slowly dying. By the way it didn't do anything for my supposed UTI. Couple days of drinking cranberry juice did the trick. Art,Art

The side effects are permanent and debilitating.",Sophie
5,Levaquin,Urinary Tract Infection,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"May 25, 2019",24,"Am allergic to Penicillin.  Am disabled & had multiple UTI’s. Levaquin saved my life.  I’ve also been an RN for 44 years. If you need a drug like Levaquin, be sure to listen to your Doctor & take it as prescribed with plenty of water & the probiotics.  If you’re not advised about this, ASK QUESTIONS.  Remember, your Doctor actually works for YOU!  Don’t just ask about this, ask about everything.  Perhaps make a list before you see the doctor & even jot down notes while with the Dr. &/or bring someone with you. How many times have you walked out of a Doc’s office & thought What did they say?.  Many things can cause allergic reactions.  Ask your Doc & perhaps keep Benadryl in your home.  P.S.: The original clear capsules have been known to dissolve quicker & get into your system faster, especially when put under your tongue.  This is in no manner meant to be medical advice.  Always ask your Doctor.  Yours, in good health.",Anonymous
6,Levaquin,Urinary Tract Infection,7.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"January 31, 2019",13,"I was prescribed this for a 7 day course. 750mg, never had a UTI in my life, so I didn't really know what to expect. Day 1, was iffy. An hour after taking it, I did get slightly dizzy, rather tired. But the next day, I felt fine. Day 2 is where I'm at, and as far as the UTI? Gone. However, it may just be sinuses, but anytime I cough, I get a dull throb in my right temporal lobe, sometimes sharp. And I've noticed the end of my tongue is kind of numb, like if you sipped too much hot coffee at once.  27, I smoke, and so far this is the only things I'm experiencing. Sleep is a little difficult, even with OTC sleep meds, but overall, it seems to be manageable.",Smorg
7,Levaquin,Urinary Tract Infection,8.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"January 5, 2019",27,"Hello I was diagnosed on Tuesday January 2, 2019 with a UTI. Never had anything like this before.  I urinated on myself at least 4 times on my way to work. Two days before I was urinating every 16 minutes for two nights in a row before that. Severe pain in my lower back and cramps in my left kidney and stomach.  I thought I was gonna die. I couldn't really stand or sit . I took the train to hospital and I  was embarrassed cuz I soiled (wee) myself but I didn't care. I needed to know what was wrong.  After seeing the doctor  they prescribed me a 7 day (750 mg) pill called LEVOFLOXACIN.  After taking a pill when I got home. I felt immediate relief in my back. I'm not at work for the next 7 days. I took my third tablet today. I do have constipation and I had stomach pain yesterday but I feel it's going to work. I'm still alive, worried because this has never happen to me. I'm 56  I'm healthy.  I work out daily. I eat only fruits,  veggies. Fish. Chicken. I pray for healing. You all deserve to feel better.",Smiley
8,Levaquin,Urinary Tract Infection,1.0,,"November 11, 2018",16,"I was prescribed 500mg Levaquin to be taken for 7 days for a UTI I developed while on a cruise. I was given this drug because I’m allergic to PCN and Cephalosporins. I read all the bad reviews but the discomfort from my UTI made me desperate for relief. About 6 hours after taking this drug I had severe pain in my lower legs. I contacted my physician at home and was told to discontinue the antibiotic immediately, that I was at serious risk of rupturing my Achilles’ tendon. I only took one pill. Unfortunately, I was on a European vacation that required a lot of walking. I am 27 years old and felt like I was 80, I could barely get around. Completely ruined my vacation. I was terrified I had permanently damaged my muscles or could injure myself and deal with a lifetime of pain. Luckily, the muscle pain went away after 4-5 days. It did take out my UTI, but I would NEVER take this again knowing the risks and side effects. There’s a reason it has a black box warning.",Heather
9,Levaquin,Urinary Tract Infection,8.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"May 2, 2018",14,I was scared to death prior to taking this medicine due to the reviews I read. I’ve been on this medicine for 5 days now and I’ve been drinking plenty of water and taking probiotics along with the antibiotic. I haven’t been able to eat much due to having no appetite and it gives me frequent headaches but other than that I haven’t had any other major issues.,Sickgirl2220
10,Levaquin,Urinary Tract Infection,2.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"April 26, 2018",15,"Taking levaquin was absolutely horrible for me. I took 750mg per day for ten days. I was prescribed it for a UTI and kidney infection and my symptoms not only got three times worse but I developed a pink rash on my face, and my bones and muscles felt horrible like I was being stabbed with ice picks everywhere. I also had zero appetite and a hard time swallowing when forcing myself to eat. I think it's safe to say I'm having those side effects. Hopefully you all have better luck with it!",Dee
11,Levaquin,Urinary Tract Infection,,,"February 17, 2018",12,I have taken this medication twice for a UTI.  The first time I had no side effects and it got rid of the UTI as well as a very mild sinus infection I didn't realize I had.  The second time I went on it I only took one dose.  About a half hour after taking the dose I was really jittery and hyper and hadn't consumed any caffeine but I didn't really think much of it.   The restlessness got worse and at around 8 I started having olfactory hallucinations.  I also started thinking my husband was plotting against me and I had insomnia.  It was a miserable night.  At around 1 in the morning it started to wear off and I realized I was having some sort if psychiatric side effect and then read that was a possible side effect.  I stopped taking it and it completely wore off within a couple days.  I called and left a message for the Dr and also sent a detailed email to her and she never followed up with me....oh well.,JLWdbry
12,Levaquin,Urinary Tract Infection,,,"September 24, 2017",13,"I took one dose of levaquin and had an immediate anaphylactic response - within minutes my eyes were swollen shut and I was gasping for breath...had a rescue squad not been close to me I would have died. This epic side effect left me with a permanent numb area on the left side of my face and dropping  eyelid. From talking to a dr who was gathering information about quinolone reactions, the numbness on the left side of my face is from damage to the central nervous system. This class of drugs has been wisely banned in many countries.",Mrs Zefo
13,Levaquin,Urinary Tract Infection,10.0,,"September 21, 2017",16,"My infections have not been simple cases of uncomplicated UTI, they progressed rapidly into Pyelonephritis. Levaquin should not be the 1st med prescribed for various UNcomplicated infections (think ""Resistance"") nor should providers refuse to prescribe it. I understand the FDA black box warning, I accept that risk. Problem is, we can literally ""google"" any drug and find every possible side effect to convince ourselves that the medication is to blame. Yes, Levaquin can be riskier (elderly, drug interactions, etc.) I've fortunately only had diarrhea (most antibiotics cause this-Google that) as a side effect. My doctor recommended taking probiotics along with an antibiotic, and it helps. Google that, too. Levaquin isn't evil.",Twynlyn
14,Levaquin,Urinary Tract Infection,10.0,,"January 10, 2017",15,"Am allergic to penicillin & more recently Keflex -a not uncommon occurrence in those with penicillin allergy. Prior to allergy, Keflex was  slow to work & caused nausea whether taken mid meal or on an empty stomach. I've used Levaquin for stubborn sinus infections & more recently my first UTI. The first time I took it, I experienced muscle soreness. With each subsequent prescription the side effects have vanished & it's efficaciousness has not diminished .Of note for those who give up on it due to nausea & muscle aches: hydration  helps reduce the symptoms. This med is not for those with certain heart issues or on some meds for mental health diagnosis.",Mimi01

My nightmare start in day 3 when I couldn't even get up from my bed.. I was sore all over my body.. I couldn't even walk..

After 2 doses, she became so confused she didn't know where she was or who I was.  Her muscles were so weak she could not move or stand.  She was paranoid and manic at times.  Her potassium dropped very low.  She was in the hospital 4 days.  They immediately took her of it, gave her IV's and potassium.  Tested her for stroke and dementia, which were negative.  She is home and better but it took several weeks.  Not a good drug, especially for elderly.  She now takes D-Mannose 1000mg/day, 2000mg for any UTI symptoms.",Sueshine

20,Levaquin,Urinary Tract Infection,,Taken for less than 1 month,"April 5, 2015",58,"I suffer from recurring UTI's. My doctor prescribed Levoquin. After a few days, my UTI symptoms went away. I suffer from bipolar disorder, so I can't make the direct link of the mood-related side effects to the Levoquin. The only side effects that I can link to the use of Levoquin are as follows: tiredness, exacerbation of sciatica, joint pain, feeling unsteady while walking, nausea, stomach pain, agitation, insomnia, minor depression, foggy headed, and confusion. I did not suffer the four most common side effects. All of the symptoms I experienced were tolerable. The Levoquin worked on my UTI within 3 days, and I continued the medication as prescribed. While others have suffered from worse side effects, that was not my experience.",LaylaDusty
21,Levaquin,Urinary Tract Infection,9.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"August 5, 2014",66,I am allergic to a lot of antibiotics (and always get side effects!) and get sick a lot. I used to take Z-Packs almost once a month and now I wonder why I hadn't tried Levaquin sooner! This is my 3rd time on Levaquin this year. I took it twice for my chronic ear infection with success. The first time my joints felt like I was an arthritic old lady! The 2nd time I had only some ankle and finger pain. I'm on day 1 today for a urinary tract infection and ear infection from a water park. I can feel it working and I have no joint pain.,Breee
22,Levaquin,Urinary Tract Infection,10.0,,"July 2, 2014",46,"I swear by Levaquin! It's what works for me. I spent so much money on Amoxicillen, Z-Pack etc... and it doesn't help. I have used it from a sinus infection, UTI, and pulmonary illnesses. It's the medicine of choice for me. I have never experienced any side effects or adverse reactions. I'm very compliant with taking it daily, there have been times I missed doses because they're prescribed 3-4x a day. It's fast acting and does the trick, love it.  I do think about becoming resistant to Levaquin, down the road, but by that time hopefully there will be another medicine of choice that is equally as effective! Thanks.",LFrancine
23,Levaquin,Urinary Tract Infection,8.0,,"May 28, 2013",41,A few hours after the first dose my arm muscles started burning like I just lifted a bunch of weights and my neck was hurting on one side but I think it was because I was so tense and worried about taking it. These symptoms lasted for about two or three more doses than went away. Took my last pill today and the only other side effects I had were headache and lightheadedness and my heart would beat faster every now and then.,Anonymous

I was really worried to use Levaquin because I read alot of bad reviews for it.  However, the only effect I had was that I felt speedy the first day I took it.  Subsequent days, I did not have this problem and I made sure to take it in the morning so it wouldn't affect my sleep.  It cured my infection wonderfully, and I had no upset stomach or yeast infection after effects.  Three months later, I got another urinary tract infection, and Levaquin again did the trick.
