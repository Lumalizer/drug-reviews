0,Macrobid,Urinary Tract Infection,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"March 30, 2022",0,"Absolutely horrible. I also as someone here mentioned never experienced any side effects from drugs until I took this one. First dose was ok. Second dose I started feeling very nauseous to the point I was very sick, I haven’t even been this sick when pregnant! Bad diarrhoea and feeling weak. I started thinking what it was as the symptoms of the UTI come on suddenly and I was perfect prior to it. I stopped immediately and today feeling much better but still weak as after having flu. Bad stuff, DON'T TAKE IT!!!!!",Aneta

3,Macrobid,Urinary Tract Infection,8.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"March 11, 2022",0,"So after reading  all of these reviews I was terrified to take this medicine. However I did take it and on day one I felt lightheaded dizzy and a little nauseous when reading the reviews some said to eat with it a lot. Make sure you eat first then take it and eat some sort of bread items. Once I did that symptoms cleared up. Made sure I ate 3 good sized meals a day. However day 4 I started getting back and muscle pain. But, when compared to a UTI I would take that any day. So word of the wise EAT good meals and you should be okay. I kept waiting for the fever and headaches but didn't happen.",Hagrid

Last time had pain and burning on the soles of feet.  Dr. thought I was nuts and told me take a Covid test which was negative.  I have never been allergic to anything before.  Weird.  It is now marked on my chart to steer clear of this drug for me.  Giving a 2 because it DID help my UTI.  Now on Cipro, we'll see.....",Macrobid flu

6,Macrobid,Urinary Tract Infection,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"February 26, 2022",1,"I’m 62, post-menopausal, and have suffered with recurrent UTIs for over 16 months. After getting recent in-depth DNA testing from MicrogenDX which showed E. coli, E. faecalis, and Klebsiella, the only 2 antibiotics that treated all 3 bacteria were Macrobid and Fosfomycin. My PCP decided to try Macrobid and prescribed 3 weeks of it at 2 per day. After only 4 capsules, I was far sicker than I’d been with the UTI. Drug sensitivity runs in my family on the women’s side but occasionally there are drugs we can tolerate. This wasn’t one of them. I felt as if I’d been poisoned - severe nausea, chills, diarrhea, weakness to the point of being unable to walk, racing heart, and what can only be described as not even being aware of my surroundings. As soon as I discontinued the Macrobid, the side effects began to slowly dissipate. Now all I have left to try is Fosfomycin and I’m hoping against hope that I’ll be able to tolerate it.",Nana B

8,Macrobid,Urinary Tract Infection,1.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"February 22, 2022",1,"Blurred vision, dilated pupils, red irritated eyes, headache, sore/dry throat, pain in right side. I'm hoping my vision returns to normal this is day 3 now of blurred vision feels like when you have your eyes dilated only much longer and more frightening wondering what effects and how long. I am feeling anxious the vision problems are not helping with this. I'm concerned and thinking this is a dangerous drug and maybe the dosage too is too high or just simply a dangerous drug. Oh, I still feel the UTI symptoms too. I was in the first half of my prescription when this started, I've called the doctor and have not heard back I plan to call or go tomorrow.  Please use caution if you are prescribed please use care if you are prescribing it and pharmacist please go over that this does indeed have dangerous side effects.",Puggles

I am 31 now and the first couple of day's I was fine as usual but on the 5th day so much diarrhea, nausea and I'm so tired. This is the worst reaction I have ever had to this. IDK why my body is reacting this way after so many times being ok with this drug.  Just be cautious this can happen. I'm done.

12,Macrobid,Urinary Tract Infection,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"February 4, 2022",0,"I was having severe pain in my upper right abdomen and in the back. Went to the ER they sent me home, ended up getting worse, I went back 5 days later dr prescribed me this. 100mg of it and I was told to take it twice a day and eat before taking it. First day I was sicker than ever in pain, came home after 5 hours in the ER and the pain did not go away (suspected maybe I had an STD like chlamydia/gonorrhea or trich) but the doctors said everything was negative so they said it was just a bad UTI. I told them I was allergic to sulfa meds and they reassured me I would be fine on this. 2nd day I am fine with the first dose and 2nd dose I begin to feel numb, my belly still hurts, my back too. I began to have this confusion that will not go away!!!! Dizzy,Nauseated, my thoughts are not making sense, I'm sweating, I begin to hallucinate and I am not doing good.

I get severe body aches, 101 fever, vomiting. I have been through this twice now, not believing my own truth the first time because it is so very odd! It’s definitely the drug. You’re not crazy. I was bed ridden with fever and sweating it out with doses of Advil… my bed was soaking wet.  I treated the symptoms and after 48 hours after dose three (I stopped after that) I’m left with a headache but much better. It’s a side effect, I believe. The antihistamine I took didn’t seem to help… and none of this makes sense as an allergic response. I’m still shocked as I feel I’m immune to this type of thing. Haha. But my UTI seems to be gone! A lot of suffering for this one.",Mjs
14,Macrobid,Urinary Tract Infection,8.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"January 22, 2022",7,"When I had my first UTI I was prescribed with Bactrim. Later found out that I was allergic to it, developed some hives and rashes. Then my Dr switched it to Microbid. It was great, did not develop any side effects. UTI was gone. 3 years later, I develop another Uti, I told my doctor that I prefer to be prescribed with Microbid since I responded very well the last time I took  it. But this time is different, I started to develop almost all of the side effects. I feel so weak, nauseated and dizzy all the time.  Lost of appetite and my vision turned out a little funny. But my UTI was  better except that the side effects just got me this time. I would say that Microbid is a good drug for UTI. As we age our body reacts differently to drugs, and indeed medications/vaccines are not a one size fits all.",Miss M

23,Macrobid,Urinary Tract Infection,,Taken for less than 1 month,"October 29, 2021",0,"Well I must say this antibiotic has been effective in treating my UTI. After two doses my symptoms were gone. That being said the side effects have been rough. I’ve experienced headaches, fatigue, slight fever and chills and gastric distress. I actually feel worse than I did with just the UTI but suppose it is worth not  getting a full blown kidney infection and all that goes with that. I’ve taken Tylenol and rested. Rested a lot!

24,Macrobid,Urinary Tract Infection,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"October 29, 2021",1,"I don't usually comment on Internet threads but I have to say, if you have been prescribed this drug, see if it works for you before being scared away. There are reviews saying to avoid at all costs and reviews claiming zero side effects. All well and good but the only way to know which way it will work for you is to try it. I was prescribed it this week and have taken two pills so far. I won't be taking the rest. I've spent the night feeling nauseous and have woken up this morning with stomach cramps, a bad headache, weak arms, hot flushes and fatigue. I feel weepy and sick and I just want to go back to bed...which is kind of impossible because I have an 18 month old. Incidentally, her night was disturbed (we're still breastfeeding) and I can only assume it's something to do with the antibiotic because the crying and screaming was very out of character her. I'd say try the drug and if you get side effects, jack it in and ask for something else. I won't take this again.",Mags41
25,Macrobid,Urinary Tract Infection,2.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"October 27, 2021",0,"Don't take it. I see comments below recommending it because they were also afraid - but I say don't. I've had UTI's often growing up from being in the pool long periods of time. There are other medications that help. I had side effects which are the worst abdominal pains, nauseousness, headaches, blurred vision - basically everything that the negative comments are stating below - but the worst part was the back and abdominal pain. It felt like a skin burn, someone squeezing your organs and somehow pinching them at the same time. I took 2 days off work literally bed ridden, messaged my doctor and she advised I go to the hospital. I hate hospitals bc I'm afraid they'll run up a bill with tests just to tell me to stop the medication. So I tried that and didn't take another dose after the 2nd dose on the 3rd day, it wasn't until 20-24hrs after that I felt like myself. I decided to try another dose and within the hr I felt all the symptoms again. I messaged my doctor all of this and she was able to prescribe me something else.",Caroline

My side effects: nausea and total fatigue, stuck in bed, no energy, a bit depressed. It is definitely the macrobid because I wake up feeling fine and then take the pill with yogurt/breakfast and then I feel horrible. But when I have a UTI I am stuck on the toilet which is much worse than being stuck in bed. The only thing annoying to me is that after the UTI goes away I'm still slightly sick from the macrobid for days.",Laura

HORRIBLE five days. I don’t usually have side effects-at least nothing too bad, but these made me feel weak, and nauseated. I had to work to catch my breath. My chest seemed heavier.

Cold sweats and dizziness comes and goes just before the evening dose is due then cycle begins again.

Eat a lot with the pill, like pasta/bread/cheese and drink a tonne of water. I drank 4L Per day while taking this. I also took a probiotic which helped with the heartburn.

I have been prescribed a combination of antibiotics over the years including macrobid, cipro, Bactrim, etc. The doctor rotates them. Never had severe reactions to any of them, aside from waves of nausea here and there and headaches. Was just prescribed macrobid this last time and had the worst reaction ever. Thought I was crazy until I read the other reviews. ANXIETY, heart racing, nausea, diarrhea. I stopped taking it immediately. I have never felt this way before. They changed me to cipro but I have so much anxiety from that last script I’m terrified to start the next. Anyways my point is we can take an antiobiotic for years and be fine, and then our bodies can change and have a reaction. Don’t immediately assume you will have a bad reaction but be very aware of how you are feeling and stop if you experience any severe symptoms.",Rachelle

I felt VERY sick from the UTI anyway, so feeling off from the macrobid made no difference. Be happy it isn't ciprofloxacin, or any other fluoroquinolones you were prescribed, which is what these doctors try to push now when patients want a switch from the med that seems would work best after a culture test.

At first I tried Cipro, it didn't work. I had kidney stones for 8 months, I finally got my second lithotripsy in June for an 8x9mm stone and then my kidney got infected. This is my fourth day on Macrobid and I have had no serious side effects except 1 bout of diarrhea on day 1, which was welcomed compared to the nausea and pain from the infection. Macrobid actually got rid of my nausea!",Chevol

I was put on Bactrim for a previous urinary tract infection and it was horrible. Nausea, felt like I had a fever, increased my heart rate etc. I'm glad I found this and hope I can take it again if I get another urinary tract infection. The only thing I noticed was that it brought back a weird cough I usually only get after a bad cold. My doctor calls it a bronchial spasm. It hasn't gone away after having been off the medicine for 3 weeks, but it was so mild compared to when I get it with a cold that I can easily deal with it. ",Anonymous

I would feel faint, overheated, extremely tired; I slept with the windows open and the heat off (it's winter). 4 days of taking Macrobid, I begin to have loose stools & severe muscles aches & neck stiffness. I began to have a sore throat & a dry cough on day 2. After stopping, within 24 hours I begin to itch severely. I've been off of it for 48 hours & I still have a headache & I use Benadryl for the itching. I was given Levaquin in 1 dose, then Macrobid 100 mg 2X a day for 10 days by the ER doctor.

I am allergic to all other medications and therefore this is all I have to work with. It works well, doesn't always work for me. Sometimes I have to take a second week of it. I often feel the same way as others. Headache if I haven't drank enough water, upset stomach if I hadn't ate enough food when taking the pill. It does make me tired as well. I try to eat well when I am on this medication to help with the energy level since I am allergic to caffeine and can't take that path. I think that if you make sure to take the pill with lots of food like they recommend, the nausea isn't that bad.
