I was prescribed it for a UTI, and since becoming an adult I’ve developed a phobia for medication due to previous bad experiences. I will say I’ve had panic attacks after taking it as well as horrible palpitations, but I feel that is my anxiety rather than the medication itself. Cleared up my infection within 3 days. I had no side effects other than the ones mentioned above. I ate before taking it, drank plenty of water, and also ate yogurt with live cultures.

I was prescribed 875mg 2x daily for 5 days. I was first prescribed Macrobid, but that made me sick on the first dose so my doctor switched to Augmentin. Some of these reviews unfortunate, BUT REMEMBER. Antibiotics work differently for everyone. Drugs like Flagyl and Macrobid make me violently ill, but Augmentin/Amoxicillin drugs have been incredibly helpful. I did have a headache and on and off nausea throughout the week, but it is very tolerable. Take it with food, plenty of water, and a daily probiotic. Also, try to avoid coffee, as it intensified my nausea. There is no way to know how your body will react unless you try it, so don't be scared like I was. If you do get sick, there are always other options. I should also mention that it cleared up my UTI symptoms after about 48 hours.",Anonymous

Before I started I read all the reviews which completely freaked me out and I was terrified to take them but had no choice in the end as my UTI was progressing and getting worse after a week with bad kidney pain. I started them last night with absolutely no side effects yet and already feeling better. I slept all night last night without the need to go to the toilet as previously.

52,Amoxicillin and Clavulanate,Urinary Tract Infection,9.0,,"August 9, 2010",59,"I have been put on Augmentin 875mg-125mg twice a day for a urinary tract/kidney infection (E.coli strain). I have taken this medication before and so I wasn't concerned about any serious side effects. This medication works well for me, which says a lot considering I do have serious side effects to many things (compazine, droperidol, erythromycin). I felt better within 1 day of taking my dose and the only problem I am experiencing is a strange rattle/""percolating"" feeling in my chest when I breathe. It's annoying but not preventing me from breathing, walking around or even going to work. I have taken a daily probiotic pill (Natures Way Primadophilus refrigerated) for years and I believe this is what prevents any upset stomach or yeast issues.",lyddy
