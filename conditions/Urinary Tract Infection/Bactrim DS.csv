0,Bactrim DS,Urinary Tract Infection,7.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"March 19, 2022",0,"So this for all the people with terrible anxiety like me. Don't read the reviews to freak out. If you NEED to read them to prepare yourself do it. So I got prescribed these for a UTI, 2 tablets a day/7 days. Perfect, fine. Took about 3 days to start working and now I feel generally okay, sorta burns in the morning but its whatever. Well the only side effects that is noticeable are terrible indigestion that tums don’t help, some light nausea (subsided with a probiotic) and anxiety. I generally have situational anxiety so I was shocked as to why I was having daily panic attacks and overwhelming anxiety almost all day long until I realized it was certainly Bactrim. Macrobid gave me awful migraines so this is a step in the better direction. Take it, some side effects are better than a kidney infection! Just make sure your dr does a culture & a drug resistance test on your urine so it works!",burnsandturns
1,Bactrim DS,Urinary Tract Infection,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"March 4, 2022",0,i started taking bactrim for my uti last week. It has made everything worse. I literally feel like I'm dying and I'm puking every morning. The side effects are worse so that I would much rather sit through the pain of a UTI then deal with this.,do not use
2,Bactrim DS,Urinary Tract Infection,9.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"January 9, 2022",2,"Please remember when reading reviews, people seldom come back to review if their experience was good. I would like to ease some peoples minds. Of course everyone’s body is different but Bactrim DS 800/160 is my favorite UTI medication. I have minimal side effects. I take each pill with food and a full bottle of water. I experience headaches & that’s about it. Occasionally I will feel kinda just off. But nothing crazy. I'd take the side effects vs. a UTI any day. Please at least give it a try and remember that anxiety can cause side effects itself. I also get nervous when trying a medication. However, a UTI can’t go untreated. Wishing you all the best.",Alexandra
3,Bactrim DS,Urinary Tract Infection,8.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"January 6, 2022",0,"Remember, you are taking this medicine to heal, to protect yourself from any worse infection. This is my second time on bactrim, I took two doses (160/80 mg)  for each day for a week. I had no side effects besides a bit of photosensitivity and a little upset stomach. Towards the end I started to get a big headache and a little pressure, but it went away. Like most people, the other reviews made me very scared, however, everyone’s experience is different, don’t let that discourage you! Unless you’re allergic to sulfa drugs, this won’t hurt you, it will help you! I hope this helps anyone who is a bit hesitant about taking this, I totally understand what you’re going through, just have the courage to push through and take care of your body!",You got this!!

5,Bactrim DS,Urinary Tract Infection,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"December 12, 2021",0,"This stuff is nightmare fuel. I’m on the third day, my UTI is still lingering and I feel worse than I’ve felt in a long time. Constant headache, weak, shaky, anxious, DIZZY, itchy??? And the diarrhea is just a fun little bonus. I would say if you’re highly sensitive to medications like I am, and you’re taking this stuff for a UTI, go and get a urine test to make sure Bactrim is the right stuff for you. Do not take this unless it’s your only option. I’m sure for those with sturdier constitutions this stuff is fine, but I’m not one of those people and I feel horrible.",Batwings
6,Bactrim DS,Urinary Tract Infection,8.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"October 29, 2021",0,"UTI came back after taking Macrobid, which was somehow more gentle to me. Started this about a week and a half later. Cleared it up again, but the only problem is I'm having is constipation and these are horse pills. YOU NEED TO EAT WITH ANTIBIOTICS!!! And drink plenty of water to flush your infection out. Not soda, not coffee, WATER. But from my experience, the harshest antibiotic was Cipro. Macrobid the gentlest, but didn't work. And I guess Bactrim is in the middle. Just my input.",rvlry

I just found out it was to help me from getting UTI’s but it didn’t work at all. This whole year I have had them every other month.

10,Bactrim DS,Urinary Tract Infection,3.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"August 2, 2021",0,"it worked and did its job in stopping my UTI pretty quickly but at the same time I was subjected to some of the worst side effects I've ever had. I was having terrible constipation and bloating and I couldn't sleep some nights from the pounding headaches and nausea. To add insult to injury, on the last day of taking it, I had a delayed allergic reaction to sulfa. This stuff was worse than my actual UTI.  Please ask for any other antibiotic.",realness
11,Bactrim DS,Urinary Tract Infection,9.0,,"July 31, 2021",0,"I was prescribed this for my UTI which was moderate (>100,000 CFU/ML R. Coli. I have had mild to moderate generalized anxiety disorder since I was 19 years old and have kept it pretty controlled and then I took this medication. I agree, my anxiety was very heightened, jittery, heart pounding, hot even though I had my air conditioner on high and did not feel like this prior to being on the medication.  I’m on day three of seven, and according to the literature three days should be sufficient so guess what, this is my last day. My infection is much much better so I know the drug is doing its job very well.  If you have any type of generalized anxiety disorder even if it is managed, I would not recommend Bactrim. Being a nurse, I am not one to start medication’s at all but this one is just too much. I get in front of people and get presentations on a daily basis and there is no way I’m going to be able to get up and do my job without having a panic attack while on this med.",Nurse Cate

The first day didn't feel great but I didn't attribute that to the medication. I took med with food, before and after and felt key was to drink a lot of water to flush system.  I cut back on coffee intake as well. Completed all meds with no side effects. It cleared the UTI up quickly.",TJ

Just thought I was lethargic the first day, but later that night my hands were shaking, heart beating fast, which induced a full anxiety attack. Kept taking the pills. Fast forward to day 4 and my head was so foggy I felt like I was a walking zombie and the shakes got so bad I had to go to urgent care. No appetite what-so-ever.

I've had many UTIs in the last year and one earlier this year. I've taken Bactrim for them before with no issue. Took a home UTI test to confirm suspicions of infection. Consulted a virtual doctor (can't get to an office because exposure to covid). And they prescribed Bactrim twice a day for 3 days. Took all the pills but symptoms came back at 5 am on the last day. (Took last dose of initial round at 11pm) Took another home test and showed trace of infection remained.  Didn't know what to do, so I got ahold of the doctor again and requested an extension of the medication. 1 dose in and waiting to see if things improve.",Anon

This by far has been the worst side effects I’ve ever experienced while taking antibiotics. I did eat right before taking the pills and I got terrible nausea, light headed spells and muscle cramps.

17,Bactrim DS,Urinary Tract Infection,1.0,,"September 6, 2020",25,"Took sulfamethoxazole with trimethoprim for a minor testicular infection. I got very sick. It caused chest pain, shortness of breath, severe headache and sharp pains all over my body. The doctor told me it was in my head and I kept taking it. I eventually ended up in hospital and was so sick I could barely sleep. It’s been a month since I took this drug and while some of the problems are gone, I still have very bad muscle weakness, cramping in my legs, and sharp pains that feel like nerve damage, I’ve seen many doctors all agree that bactrim did something to my system. I urge you do not take this drug, I haven’t had any response from my doctor since I called with all my symptoms. It has gotten so severe I’m starting to think my life might never be the same and I was completely health, 21 year old before this. DO NOT TAKE THIS.",Cam

I was prescribed 6 pills, 2 per day for 3 days.  By pill #2, I lost my appetite, and felt very weak and tired.  Went to bed very early.  As I continued the medication, I developed many flu-like symptoms, and spent the next 4 days in bed.  Chills, achiness, lethargy, listlessness, extreme tiredness, brain fog, inability to stand up for very long without feeling woozy, not even able to sit up and do light work indoors.  This medication had me flat in bed for 4 days straight.  Two days after finishing the medication, I have still not regained my strength completely, although I am starting to normalize.  I am typically a very active person, who works outdoors every day.  This one threw me for a loop - never again! I will ask for something else for a UTI.",hortlady
