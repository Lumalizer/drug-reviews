The symptoms went away pretty quickly after taking the first pill but came back after I stopped to take the medicine two days later. From what I remember I got really sick: chills, high fever, nausea, complete loss of appetite, extreme fatigue, and red patches all over my body but especially on my arms/ legs and chest. I had swollen lips for first indication but as I was young I didn’t understand it at first. When I went back to the doctor, he said it was a pretty powerful medicine and that he knew beforehand that a risk of allergy was higher than other medicines. I don’t hold it against him though, it was very frustrating not to find anything that would work to cure this UTI.",Lolo

2,Sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim,Urinary Tract Infection,7.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"March 19, 2022",0,"Bactrim DS (sulfamethoxazole / trimethoprim):So this for all the people with terrible anxiety like me. Don't read the reviews to freak out. If you NEED to read them to prepare yourself do it. So I got prescribed these for a UTI, 2 tablets a day/7 days. Perfect, fine. Took about 3 days to start working and now I feel generally okay, sorta burns in the morning but its whatever. Well the only side effects that is noticeable are terrible indigestion that tums don’t help, some light nausea (subsided with a probiotic) and anxiety. I generally have situational anxiety so I was shocked as to why I was having daily panic attacks and overwhelming anxiety almost all day long until I realized it was certainly Bactrim. Macrobid gave me awful migraines so this is a step in the better direction. Take it, some side effects are better than a kidney infection! Just make sure your dr does a culture & a drug resistance test on your urine so it works!",burnsandturns

After 2 days of being on the drug I started to develop hives all over my body. Even on the soles of feet and palms of my hands. The itching is so horrible. I went to urgent care and they prescribed a steroid and hydroxyzine for the itching. Prior to this I had no allergies whatsoever not even seasonal allergies. I would ask for an antibiotic that does not contain sulfacetamide.  I also read the reviews here and wasn't worried because I never had any problems,Maire

So far, no noticeable side effects. I am on day 2. I am generally medication compliant and have never experienced any serious reactions from taking medication. I think doing your part and taking care of your body by eating healthy and exercising is helpful while taking any antibiotic, including getting enough sleep. The pill itself is a medium size. Not the smallest but also not big to the point where it is difficult to swallow. I no longer have the urge to pee not do I feel any burning sensation when peeing, so the meds started working quickly!

I had no serious side effects. I only experienced migraines during the first 2 days and some leg pain/body aches that I took ibuprofen for in the following days (i took it twice daily for 7 days). I took this because the previous antibiotic did not work on me and my infection came back the next day. But this antibiotic works, although it’s very strong. I felt relief in merely a few hours. A lot of other people write about fainting when they’re outside, but the medication specifically says to stay out of the sun. Others also write about vomiting when they didn’t eat anything with the meds. These side effects are often easily prevented, so don’t stress when you read about them. But seriously, be careful reading these, you’ll give yourself a panic attack like I did.

Before I took the medication, I only had slight burning with urination. The next day I pushed water like crazy and thought I was getting better. The meds made me speedy. I was in a fog, but was getting things done. I felt very sickly. I thought, again, that it was a good thing I got the antibiotics because my infection must be super severe to make me this ill. That night I got very short of breath and my heart was pounding. I thought I may have caught covid. I tried to sleep. Through the night I was awake with awful thoughts of death and severe anxiety.

It’s hard to think clearly or assess the situation when you’re under the effects of a drug that’s messing with your head, but after reading about it I thought it was Bactrim-related.  I did not take it this morning, and I made an appointment for tomorrow to re-assess the UTI. While I was at work today, I got super hot, sweaty, and dizzy. I’ve never felt like that before. I believe I ended up having a panic attack/migraine reaction. I was short of breath, had tightness in my chest, lightheaded, etc. After I went to the clinic at work and lay down for about an hour, I felt good enough to go home but still shaky and weak, which are symptoms with my chronic migraines. Bactrim is definitely going on my list of drug allergies!  It took several days for the symptoms to show up. I guess it’s because the levels of the drug had risen.",Kat C

The side effects can be rough, but it works for me. I took it for 4 days, twice a day. I had slightly more side effects this time than the first time I took this. Red eyes, fatigue, and headaches on day one. On day 3 I started to get itchy skin with no redness. It also felt painful at times, especially on day 4. Also had back pain, which I did get last time. UTI felt all but gone on day 1 though. This stuff is powerful, but it works. I think shorter durations for this drug are better, cause it works fast and the side effects can get worse the longer you're on them. I've tried Macrobid, and it did nothing, so this will always be my preferred antibiotic, despite the side effects. It's worth it to get rid of the UTI.",TL

You NEED TO EAT SOMETHING with most meds, and drinking lots of water (way more than normal) is important too. I don't eat/drink water enough on a regular basis, and I love alcohol but, if I'm on a med, I alter my lifestyle to relieve symptoms of an infection I felt were bothersome enough to go to the drs in the first place. I've had no issues with bactrim/sulfa thankfully, and those who have might want to find out if they are allergic to it prior to writing a bad review.
