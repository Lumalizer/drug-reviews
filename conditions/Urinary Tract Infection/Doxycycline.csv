1,Doxycycline,Urinary Tract Infection,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"October 19, 2021",0,"Took Doxycycline the last time I had UTI(Male) and it didn't work.  Thought I would give it another try and it didn't work this time. I am going to call the doctor and tell him to give me another  antibiotic. A lot of people said this drug was great. Everybody's system is different,  what works for one person may not work for another.",TXGUY
2,Doxycycline,Urinary Tract Infection,2.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"September 27, 2021",0,"I took as prescribed, and about two days in I noted nausea, and my heart beating so hard/fast. Because of the heavy nausea, eating has become a struggle, and I already stopped taking it over 24 hours ago. Also, I have Acid Reflux I take medication for, and the Doxycycline Mono (100mgs) has aggravated my stomach and lower esophagus to the point where I feel they are on a low constant simmer; not good when Acid Reflux can cause cancer. I personally will never take it again; the side effects were horrendous for the short period of time (7 days twice daily for me) I was supposed to take it, and not being able to eat is never good. I honestly cannot say if it helped in any way because of how absolutely rotten it has made me feel.",Katt
3,Doxycycline,Urinary Tract Infection,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"June 28, 2021",10,At 47 I started having to get up every night while sleeping to pee and was told by pcp that I was just getting older.  Then I  was prescribed Doxycycline 2 1/2 years later for bronchitis  and almost immediately the nightly ritual of peeing 1 or 2 times has stopped completely and getting full nights of sleep once again......,sctywrnr
4,Doxycycline,Urinary Tract Infection,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"January 31, 2021",9,"Scariest experience in my life and I've been septic twice before so that says a lot! After finishing a week of doxy I had trouble with wheezing, then diarrhea, then massive attacks of high blood pressure and heart rate. Felt like a heroin overdose...two trips to ER with zero help. Day 10 of bad reaction, I’m still scared to be home alone with my kids. Allergist thinks it was a drug induced Vaso-vagal response....BEWARE!!!!! NEVER again!",Tam
5,Doxycycline,Urinary Tract Infection,9.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"January 19, 2021",74,"The two side effects that always got me while taking doxy were the feeling of nausea and having diarrhea shortly after taking the medicine. For the nausea, I would just eat and it would pretty much immediately go away. Anyways...I did a 10 day course because I noticed burning in my urethra while peeing and the need to go to the restroom very often, and after about the 3rd or 4th day, the burning was gone but it took until about the 7th or 8th day for the urgency to pee to go away. I’m an adult male 6’1, 230lbish, and I took a 100mg dose twice a day, usually 12 hours apart. Hope this helps!",Reinhardt
6,Doxycycline,Urinary Tract Infection,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"November 3, 2020",22,I read the reviews on this particular drug and was very worried about it making me sicker than I was.  After 1 day I was so much better!!  No side effects and I am so pleased.,jam
7,Doxycycline,Urinary Tract Infection,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"August 27, 2020",23,Can I just say if you experience a reaction to doxycycline you do not continue taking a medication you speak to your GP. All drugs have side effects these negative comments might dissuade someone from taking this medication. In 9/10 people it is perfectly safe.,Chris
8,Doxycycline,Urinary Tract Infection,1.0,,"May 3, 2020",22,"I took a two week course of doxycycline because I had pain in my testicles, the doctor assumed it was a uti or kidney infection. Within a couple days of taking the drug I noticed I was having some serious mood swings (would only notice upon reflection of what I had said to people)Then came extreme sun sensitivity (ended up with pretty bad sun burn and eczema, mostly on my fingers and hands) and fairly regular tingling in my hands and joint pain in my knees and elbows, I also have serious sensitivity and pain in my fingertips (especially if i tried to squeeze something to pick it up).INow about a month and a half after finishing the course  have noticed pain in my joints again and the most strange thing for me in that my thumb nails are falling off and some fingernails connection to my fingers are starting to recede. On the other hand I basically had no problem with testicular pain straight from the first dose of the drug.",Ryan
9,Doxycycline,Urinary Tract Infection,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"February 18, 2020",65,"I took doxycycline with food and a large glass of water both morning and night. I had no side effects whatsoever- no nausea, vomiting, headache, etc. I felt symptom relief after just 1 day.

10,Doxycycline,Urinary Tract Infection,8.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"January 10, 2020",25,"Prescribed for urerithitis (an inflammation of the urethra gland).  Medicine generally works well; I did have some issues with my blood pressure increasing (normal for me is about 128/85, the doxycycline caused it to go up to about 145/90, but this appears to be temporary). Don't have any pain in my urethra as of now; still have 7 days left on the medication!",jackx1974
11,Doxycycline,Urinary Tract Infection,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"December 17, 2019",15,"This was my second time on the med. The first time I had no issues at all. Prescribed 100mg twice a day. This time I had nausea, dizziness, severe headaches and worst of all, non-stop panic attacks. I do have anxiety issues but rarely ever have panic attacks so this scared me big time. My doctor pulled me off after Day 3 and said my infection was likely gone since the side effects went away and a week later I have an infection again.",mishni
12,Doxycycline,Urinary Tract Infection,1.0,,"August 16, 2019",19,"I was given Macrobid first for the presence of strep B in a urine culture.  On the third pill I felt flu like so I stopped. I was then prescribed a single dose Monurol (focfomycin) but the flu symptoms and pain in my back/ kidney area continued.  Then I was given doxycycline.  Things just went down hill.  I thought I was experiencing a kidney infection, a gallbladder problem infection or even hepatitis A!  I experienced a throbbing headache.  All over body flu symptoms, numbness and weakness in hand, pain in ankles, hamstring.  Went to ER; organs fine; blood fine; urine not readable after taking too many antibiotics.  Stopped the drug after this.  I am incapacitated in bed with total weakness, shaking, abdominal pain.  I have to fly tomorrow.  Praying I can make it.  Antibiotics either kill you or the infection.  It’s a gamble every time.",None

I googled ""why does my urine smell so pungent"". The response was possible UTI (Urinary Tract Infection). I purchased AZO urinary tract infection home self testing Test Strips at my local pharmacy and the results were positive. My doctor prescribed Doxycycline Hyclate 100mg. Within 3 days, the color and odor of my urine returned to normal. I continued to take my RX as prescribed for the next 7 days, took another AZO self test, and the results were negative. This drug worked for me; no side effects.",Eric
15,Doxycycline,Urinary Tract Infection,9.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"September 1, 2018",237,"I was prescribed this medicine for UTI. So far (day 3) my UTI pain has gone down a lot. If you’re like me and you research every detail of a medicine before you take it, please listen to me. I have extremely bad anxiety and I’ll think I have tons of symptoms after I take my medicine but it’s just my anxiety. Take a deep breath. Take some probiotics, eat (if it is with food) and then take your antibiotics and you’ll be fine. Get some rest and drink water. This medicine gave me no symptoms. Stop researching!

17,Doxycycline,Urinary Tract Infection,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"February 24, 2018",22,"My dose was 100mg every 12 hours for 4 days. Full recovery. Marked changes beginning within 5 hours of first dose. Nervous that readers here are making decisions on self-medication (which is not uncommon in a poorly insured by educated US). This is the oral drug of choice for Borellia (Lyme) infection; a stealth bacteria in the circulatory system;  those that are unknowingly Lyme infected may react quickly and badly to this drug, as it turns loose antigens (from dying Borellia) that suddenly may be dealt with by an already heightened immune system. Review 'Herxheimer' (Herx), which is DIAGNOSTIC for Lyme IMHO. Treatment must continue unabated every 12 hours for at least 3-weeks for late stage patients, and be followed by daily IV- Ceftrioxone for another 5-weeks with consult of a Lyme Literate Physician.",Tatter

I used to take it with yogurt. I learned to avoid dairy with, +/- 2 hrs before and after the med and I don't have problems anymore. Hope this helps. There is another trick. I have taken Doxy made in Europe and I never had any side effects - even when taken with yogurt. I have no explanation for this.",anonymia
19,Doxycycline,Urinary Tract Infection,5.0,,"November 2, 2017",14,This is the 4th time taking this in two years and it does make me sick (it's for acne and UTI). Upset stomach etc.. But I can’t really take the other antibiotics they give me hives and fast heart rates. The most disturbing thing I’ve noticed the last 2 times using doxycycline I’ve had breakthrough vaginal bleeding and NO I’m not on birth control and have very regular periods when I’m not taking doxycycline.. It normally takes a while for my period to go back to normal after I take them. Anyone else had this issue?,Justme76

26,Doxycycline,Urinary Tract Infection,10.0,,"March 28, 2016",75,"I suffer from an eye inflamation disorder, and am on doxy for life, so when i had a UTI recently I just upped the dosage - Thought I would share a few of the more common side effects with you. 1st is Nausea - if you shock your system with it (Doxy is a VERY powerful broad spectrum antibiotic) by taking too much too quickly you are likely to get lightheaded and nauseous about an hour after taking it - symptoms persist for another hour or so, and then goes away - best bet is spread it out but with a lower dose - 50mg 4 x a day is just as effective as 100mg twice a day, but causes MUCH fewer symptoms. Secondly - this WILL destroy your natural gastrointestinal flaura and after 3 days or so you will get looser stools and your gas will be BAD",svensoni

It worked, but a couple of days later the UTI returned. The doctor prescribed a second week of 100mg/2x a day for an additional week, during that week, I experienced fever, chills, severe headache, confusion, major nausea and vomited twice.  I went to Urgent Care tonight, because it feels like a pill has been stuck burning my throat for 3 days.  The Urgent Care doctor acknowledged swollen glands, and raw, bright-red throat, and tested for mono and strep-both tests came back negative.

It is the worst medicine to ever have to take, but I have to say it is probably doing its job! I still have 4 days of it left, wish me luck, but I would recommend this to anyone who has a serious infection.
