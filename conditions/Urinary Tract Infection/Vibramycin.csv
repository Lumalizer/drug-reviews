0,Vibramycin,Urinary Tract Infection,,Taken for less than 1 month,"May 5, 2013",71,"Prescribed for both my urinary tract infection and sinus infection, at the same time. I am a vegan and am finding a bit difficult to time my dosage (2 a day) around other medicines and meals.  I believe it is causing headaches and nausea.  I have not vomited, but feel as if I could.  In the middle of cycle of prescription- hope I can tolerate the remainder.  ",db
