0,Trimethoprim,Urinary Tract Infection,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"March 21, 2022",0,"This antibiotic has left me really unwell, I was prescribed 200mg 2x daily for 3 days, I only took 3 tablets ( 1 a day)..firstly felt like my kidneys had been battered, followed by severe stomach pain, extreme shivers and anxiety, also bad insomnia !! Getting sharp shooting pains ( like an electric shock all through my body !! Bad muscle aches as well.. warning !! If you suffer mental illness please avoid, as these pills really heighten everything.  No more for me, it is an awful drugs. Not forgetting head aches, facial pain and horrendous nausea. I feel for all the patients experiencing these unwanted side effects, it's been 1 and a 1/2 days since stopping them, praying this will all pass real soon. In my opinion, they should be taken off the market pronto hope doctors realise what toxicity they cause. I never will I take these again, not worth the suffering.",Female 45 - 55

2,Trimethoprim,Urinary Tract Infection,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"March 4, 2022",5,"Was prescribed 200mg twice a day for uti & possible kidney infection for 5 days. Not even an hour after the 1st pill hit my system I was throwing up, shaking, agitated, having horrific thoughts, anxiety,  couldn't stand and had such bad fatigue I could hardly lift my head off the pillow. Also had facial bone pain along my jaw and cheekbones. After my 3rd day (today 4th March 22) my doctor advised to stop & switch to a different antibiotic as I am just not coping on these. I'd rather sit in the bath for hours on end drinking cranberry juice and water to flush out the uti than ever take these again!",123

It took a single dose to realize that this type of antibiotics wasn’t for me. I broke out in hives with a swollen face the next morning. I had never had an allergic reaction to drugs before. My arms and legs are extremely itchy. The only plus side is that despite having a sensitive stomach, it didn’t make me nauseous nor did it give me bad stomach cramps.",Sarah

7,Trimethoprim,Urinary Tract Infection,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"December 27, 2021",4,"Prescribed a three day course (one twice a day) for UTI over the phone. First day gave me a raging head and dizziness. The second day (Xmas eve) I felt nauseous all day. Decided to take my second dose with food. An hour later I started vomiting and violently shaking. This lasted a few hours when it seemed to subside (I'm 2 weeks post COVID so it's easy to blame COVID for everything, but this felt different). Xmas day morning the vomiting returned along with the violent shaking - no fever. Also, mind full of paranoid thoughts. I have never been so scared in my life. Rang 111, the doctor said it was a reaction to the trimethoprim and to stop taking them (I had). Prescribed anti-sickness tablets and advised to call back if symptoms worsened. Thankfully by boxing day I had recovered. I just can't believe these side effects aren't made common knowledge.",Chummy

Night one I started to vomit and zero energy with an indescribable migraine, I put it down to the UTI making me poorly. Over the next few days I started my muscles to cramp up massively my arms and legs would not move and the energy to move them was too much.

I have never felt like this before in my life and I have never experienced this after taking any other antibiotic. I told the pharmacist about the symptoms/side effects and she told me to notify my doctor/GP, which I did, and she said that when I complete the course (I was on day 6 of a 7 day course) that after a few days I should feel better.

All the symptoms I had along with the UTI were awful exactly as others have described ie couldn’t sleep, felt very sick, was sick as just had no appetite for 5 days whilst in them. These tablets should make you feel better not suicidal. Had a terrible headache and felt weird and anxiety thoughts went through the roof ended up in A&E on the second day.

It was completely ineffective and I needed up at a different doctor 40 hours later with not only my down there burning and inflamed but now severe pain in my back which I can only infer was due to my kidneys now also becoming infected. You want to know what that feels like, get into a resting state and ask someone to smash hammer into your mid back just below the waist on either side of the spine as hard as they can.

Was prescribed trimethoprim for 5 days. 300mg, one per day.I have never had such a horrible reaction to an antibiotic. I did think it was odd that the dose was so low and only 1 per day, and now I know why. Any higher and I probably would have been hospitalised! I had the worst, worst stomach cramps, nausea, wobbly legs, zero energy, couldn’t sleep at night, sweating on and off, horrible jaw clenching, tense body muscles (especially in the back of my neck) and very, very anxious. It’s easy to second guess yourself and think that these side affects are just in conjunction with the UTI but me, personally, know my body very, very well and these tablets just made me so sick and in my opinion the UTI was easier than taking these.  Now that I’m 2 days off these pills I am creeping back to normality. My advice is don’t take them unless you want to risk the side affects.",S

This is the 3rd time I’ve taken it, belatedly remember that last time didn’t work too & I went back to a female dr who prescribed another round BUT ALSO wrote a penicillin script in case it still doesn’t clear up, which all UTI prone females know does the job. I ended up ditching the trimethprim & took the penicillin instead, which worked. My opinion as a 37 yr old female: refuse trimethoprim If you’re not allergic to penicillin. It doesn’t seem to be effective in the one 300mg/day dose against UTIs, & the side effects alone on that amount are crappy.
