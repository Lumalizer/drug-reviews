On ninth day, yeast infection continued in spite of treatment but no UTI symptoms.",Lindsay
1,Cefuroxime,Urinary Tract Infection,,Taken for less than 1 month,"November 2, 2020",6,"I have taken  Cefuroxime axetil 500 mg twice times daily for 7 days. It's works well and no side effects. After I took pills in just few days and the pain disappeared and the infection comes out clean. It's significantly helpful and no symptoms though. I recommend.  After that, I took other antibiotic medication named nitrofurantoin MCR 100 mg, take twice daily for three days and then take  1 pill for 3 days. It's seldom doesn't work sometimes, while I drank lot of water, but the infection get back after took all medicine next few days later, probably 5-6 days.",pattihurst
2,Cefuroxime,Urinary Tract Infection,9.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"September 9, 2020",5,"I have taken Ceftin several times for sinus infections and it has worked well with minimal side effects. I went to urgent care with a UTI and she put me on Macrobid which I had never take before (first UTI) and it seemed to help alleviate symptoms pretty quickly but I felt worse physically. My PCP switched me to Ceftin 250 mg 2x a day for 10 days. It didn’t seem to work as quickly but it did work and I had no side effects, but I know I tolerate this drug very well. All antibiotics cause stomach upset so take a good quality probiotic, solaray urgent care probiotic and florastor keep my stomach pretty normal while on antibiotics.",Lys
3,Cefuroxime,Urinary Tract Infection,3.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"August 27, 2020",2,"Age 27 Female. Had UTI for a long time, had no symptoms though. Cloudy smelly urine a day before I felt pain. All of a sudden, left side and groin started aching. Could hear and feel stuff on left side. VERY uncomfortable. Tele Doc suspected Pyelonephritis. Put me on Augmentin 875-125 mg twice a day for 10 days. Did not work. Went to urgent care 2 days later, put me on cefuroxime axetil 500 mg twice daily for 14 days.  Pain subsided for 4 days, fifth day pain returned. Thought it was because I was drinking a lot of coffee. (It wasnt!) Doc put me on Ciprofloxacin 500 mg twice a day for 7 days.

4,Cefuroxime,Urinary Tract Infection,10.0,,"April 29, 2020",16,"Had a UTI 2 wks ago. Was Rx'd Nitrofurantoin 2x daily. Then on the 25th, started having symptoms of UTI again. Went back to urgent care yesterday. Doc did another UA, and the results even specified which antibiotic would work the best, which was this med. Took first dose last night with zofran because antibiotics make me sick and went to bed. Took two doses today and feel TONS better! So far I've had no side effects but I take a probiotic so I think it's helped.A note to those who suffer from joint pain and swelling on ANY antibiotic; there's the risk of tendon rupture so if you experience pain and swelling of any extremity, see your doctor ASAP to rule it out.Hoping y'all are doing ok during the COVID19 pandemic. Please stay safe!!",JediMaster

11,Cefuroxime,Urinary Tract Infection,9.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"August 29, 2017",34,"Ceftin (cefuroxime):When I read all of the reviews I was kind of terrified to start Ceftin, but I had no reason to be! The only side effect I found for the first day was gas and bloating, but it definitely could've been unrelated. As long as you take this antibiotic with a meal (nothing crazy, doesn't have to be huge) and take probiotics daily, you should be totally fine! I've been on it for 4 days and I feel great with no side effects. Tomorrow is my last day, so I'm hoping my UTI will be cleared out! My only complaint is that because I took the liquid, it definitely was not pleasant to swallow and I found the easiest way to make it tolerable was to mix it with a sweeter flavored drink, as the antibiotic is a bit gritty and bitter.",Anonymous
12,Cefuroxime,Urinary Tract Infection,3.0,,"April 10, 2017",16,I came down with a UTI on 4/1/17. My Primary Care Provider couldn't get me in so I ended up going to Urgent Care on 4/6/17 as I couldn't stand to suffer any longer. (I have compromised kidneys so nearly every time I get a UTI it develops into a kidney infection) The Urgent Care doctor prescribed me Cefuroxime. I was surprised when I picked it up from the pharmacy because it wasn't the same anti-biotic that I normally get prescribed for my UTI/kidney infections. Today is 4/10/17 and I still feel absolutely awful. It seems to be having no effect. I'm used to feeling better relatively quickly with the other antibiotic that I'm normally prescribed. I guess I'll be heading back to the doctor this week!,RizzoDizzo

18,Cefuroxime,Urinary Tract Infection,9.0,,"September 5, 2008",94,"10 days ago, I was diagnosed with urinary tract infection and was prescribed cefuroxime axetil 500 mg 2 x a day. After the first capsule, the severe symptoms of infection were gone. Although I've experienced light headedness and some anxiety after the morning dose, I think, it's worth it compared to the pain and anxiety experienced during the infection.",Bobbie B.
19,Cefuroxime,Urinary Tract Infection,9.0,,"July 1, 2008",94,"I'm in the last couple of days of a 10-day prescription for cefuroxime (Ceftin) to treat acute prostatitis and mild bladder infection.  The pain and discomfort subsided 3-4 days after beginning treatment.  I've been managing the loose stool problem with multiple small portions of yogurt during the day.  I'm also experiencing mild irritability and anxiety while taking the drug, a fair trade-off compared to my symptoms before starting treatment.",Andrew P.
