The doctor nor the pharmacy counseled me about damage to tendons, ligaments, muscles, and joints or the affects to my Central Nervous System.  I was ill and did not see the warning papers in the pharmacy bag.  These types of antibiotics Fluroquinolones are dangerous and should not be prescribed so carelessly.  Thousands of people have been injured from Fluroquinolones.  Big Pharma strikes again and now I am facing a lifetime of pain and suffering.

I never write reviews but  I felt like it was necessary for people like me who google everything. Before taking levofloxacin antibiotic I did my research and looked up all the symptoms, side effects, and reviews. Unfortunately, they were all horrific! It took me a few days to get started on levofloxacin medication because  I was so afraid of the dangerous side affects that we listed on the warning  label. I called the doctor and the pharmacist regarding my concern and to ease my worries they told me I’ll be fine they prescribe it to children and young adults all the time  .. there is really only one way to find out and THANKFULLY I had no side effect.

If you’re not advised about this, ASK QUESTIONS.  Remember, your Doctor actually works for YOU!  Don’t just ask about this, ask about everything.  Perhaps make a list before you see the doctor & even jot down notes while with the Dr. &/or bring someone with you. How many times have you walked out of a Doc’s office & thought What did they say?.

About 6 hours after taking this drug I had severe pain in my lower legs. I contacted my physician at home and was told to discontinue the antibiotic immediately, that I was at serious risk of rupturing my Achilles’ tendon. I only took one pill. Unfortunately, I was on a European vacation that required a lot of walking. I am 27 years old and felt like I was 80, I could barely get around. Completely ruined my vacation. I was terrified I had permanently damaged my muscles or could injure myself and deal with a lifetime of pain. Luckily, the muscle pain went away after 4-5 days. It did take out my UTI, but I would NEVER take this again knowing the risks and side effects. There’s a reason it has a black box warning.",Heather

About a half hour after taking the dose I was really jittery and hyper and hadn't consumed any caffeine but I didn't really think much of it.   The restlessness got worse and at around 8 I started having olfactory hallucinations.  I also started thinking my husband was plotting against me and I had insomnia.  It was a miserable night.  At around 1 in the morning it started to wear off and I realized I was having some sort if psychiatric side effect and then read that was a possible side effect.

Yes, Levaquin can be riskier (elderly, drug interactions, etc.) I've fortunately only had diarrhea (most antibiotics cause this-Google that) as a side effect.

I did not suffer the four most common side effects. All of the symptoms I experienced were tolerable. The Levoquin worked on my UTI within 3 days, and I continued the medication as prescribed. While others have suffered from worse side effects, that was not my experience.",LaylaDusty
49,Levofloxacin,Urinary Tract Infection,9.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"August 5, 2014",66,Levaquin (levofloxacin):I am allergic to a lot of antibiotics (and always get side effects!) and get sick a lot. I used to take Z-Packs almost once a month and now I wonder why I hadn't tried Levaquin sooner! This is my 3rd time on Levaquin this year. I took it twice for my chronic ear infection with success. The first time my joints felt like I was an arthritic old lady! The 2nd time I had only some ankle and finger pain. I'm on day 1 today for a urinary tract infection and ear infection from a water park. I can feel it working and I have no joint pain.,Breee
50,Levofloxacin,Urinary Tract Infection,10.0,,"July 2, 2014",46,"Levaquin (levofloxacin):I swear by Levaquin! It's what works for me. I spent so much money on Amoxicillen, Z-Pack etc... and it doesn't help. I have used it from a sinus infection, UTI, and pulmonary illnesses. It's the medicine of choice for me. I have never experienced any side effects or adverse reactions. I'm very compliant with taking it daily, there have been times I missed doses because they're prescribed 3-4x a day. It's fast acting and does the trick, love it.  I do think about becoming resistant to Levaquin, down the road, but by that time hopefully there will be another medicine of choice that is equally as effective! Thanks.",LFrancine

This time however after my 5th does out of 7 I developed severe tendonitis in my hands, feet and knees. The first morning I woke up with this pain I could only close my hands about half way. I discontinued the medicine and thankfully the pain went away after a few days.",cishaw82

These symptoms lasted for about two or three more doses than went away. Took my last pill today and the only other side effects I had were headache and lightheadedness and my heart would beat faster every now and then.,Anonymous
53,Levofloxacin,Urinary Tract Infection,9.0,,"February 22, 2013",106,"Levaquin (levofloxacin):I was given Levaquin for a urinary tract infection after first trying Bactrim, which didn't work.  I was really worried to use Levaquin because I read alot of bad reviews for it.  However, the only effect I had was that I felt speedy the first day I took it.  Subsequent days, I did not have this problem and I made sure to take it in the morning so it wouldn't affect my sleep.  It cured my infection wonderfully, and I had no upset stomach or yeast infection after effects.  Three months later, I got another urinary tract infection, and Levaquin again did the trick.  I really like this antibiotic!",scholastic1500
