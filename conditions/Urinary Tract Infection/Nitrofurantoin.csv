Gave me a headache, nausea, felt disoriented, brain fog, heart palpations, fatigue, and feelings of sadness. Went to ER. Doc prescribed me a different antibiotic.

1,Nitrofurantoin,Urinary Tract Infection,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"March 30, 2022",0,"Macrobid (nitrofurantoin):Absolutely horrible. I also as someone here mentioned never experienced any side effects from drugs until I took this one. First dose was ok. Second dose I started feeling very nauseous to the point I was very sick, I haven’t even been this sick when pregnant! Bad diarrhoea and feeling weak. I started thinking what it was as the symptoms of the UTI come on suddenly and I was perfect prior to it. I stopped immediately and today feeling much better but still weak as after having flu. Bad stuff, DON'T TAKE IT!!!!!",Aneta
2,Nitrofurantoin,Urinary Tract Infection,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"March 28, 2022",0,"I’ll try to make a long story..short. I had a CT scan in December 2021 for kidney stones. My lungs were normal at that time. This month, I was prescribed Nitrofurantoin for an UTI. On the 3rd morning, I developed flu-like symptoms. Nothing leading up to it, no scratchy throat, etc. Just suddenly, I was very ill. I could have left the UTI untreated and still would have felt better than I did on this prescription! I was out of work for 4 days. Also, I took a Covid test AND a flu test..both were negative. I had another CT scan scheduled ( for the kidney stones again) on the last day of dosage. (Btw- I informed my urologist and he told me to immediately stop taking it) My test result came back with Pleural Effusion unilateral/left lung only. Today, I had a follow up X ray for THAT scary issue. No pleural effusion..gone. Yes, my UTI is gone too. Was all this all worth it? NO! I will never, ever again take this medication.

I took one pill at noon yesterday and the side effects were immediate. Nausea, chills, vomiting, tiredness, and stomach cramping. I called the pharmacist and they said those are normal. At this point I’m in tears from the pain and nausea so I go the emergency room. It was so bad I thought maybe I had a kidney infection. My heart rate at the ER was through the roof.  They took me off the nitrofurantion right away and prescribed something else. I only took one pill at noon yesterday  , it’s been almost 24 hours and still feel just as bad.

However I did take it and on day one I felt lightheaded dizzy and a little nauseous when reading the reviews some said to eat with it a lot. Make sure you eat first then take it and eat some sort of bread items. Once I did that symptoms cleared up. Made sure I ate 3 good sized meals a day. However day 4 I started getting back and muscle pain. But, when compared to a UTI I would take that any day. So word of the wise EAT good meals and you should be okay.

8,Nitrofurantoin,Urinary Tract Infection,3.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"March 4, 2022",0,"I have taken this medicine in the past.  And it has worked very quickly.  Only side effect that I ever had was nausea, so taking it with food is a must if you have a sensitive stomach.  But this time was totally different.  A little after four hours of taking my first pill, I noticed that my palms started to itch.  Then my heels started to itch.  Thirty minutes after that I started to itch all over and started to develop hives everywhere on my body.  So strange how a medicine that you never really had problems with before, can turn on you.  Do not be afraid to take the medicine.  Just keep some benadryl on hand incase it is ever needed.  I learned the hard way.",Sam

I had urinary discomfort after having sex but decided to just keep an eye on it, take vitamin c and cranberry pills and drank a lot of water to see if I felt better. A week later after having sex, I woke up peeing blood. I immediately went to urgent care where they prescribed med for 7 days twice a day. Even though it got rid of my UTI.   I was experiencing really bad anxiety, racing thoughts and I just overall felt unsteady 3-4 days while on it. Which I never experienced before taking this med. But I continued to take the med because my UTI was feeling better. It’s been four days since I finished the medication and I am still experiencing dizziness, I feel dazed all the time, extremely fatigued, blurred vision, I just feel zoned out. I’m hoping that this med did not cause any permanent damage I’m hoping that within a few days I will feel back to myself. I do not recommend this med at all.",Anonymous

After getting recent in-depth DNA testing from MicrogenDX which showed E. coli, E. faecalis, and Klebsiella, the only 2 antibiotics that treated all 3 bacteria were Macrobid and Fosfomycin. My PCP decided to try Macrobid and prescribed 3 weeks of it at 2 per day. After only 4 capsules, I was far sicker than I’d been with the UTI. Drug sensitivity runs in my family on the women’s side but occasionally there are drugs we can tolerate. This wasn’t one of them. I felt as if I’d been poisoned - severe nausea, chills, diarrhea, weakness to the point of being unable to walk, racing heart, and what can only be described as not even being aware of my surroundings. As soon as I discontinued the Macrobid, the side effects began to slowly dissipate. Now all I have left to try is Fosfomycin and I’m hoping against hope that I’ll be able to tolerate it.",Nana B

14,Nitrofurantoin,Urinary Tract Infection,3.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"February 24, 2022",0,"I was prescribed this for a UTI, 2x daily for 3 days (6 total pills). A few hours after taking my 5th pill, I experienced the most severe stomach pain and bloating I've ever felt. More concerningly, my arms and legs started to tingle and eventually my lower arms seized up entirely and went numb. I could not move my hands or fingers for at least five minutes, and I also struggled to speak. I am a 23 year old female with no previous history of anything like this occurring. I ended up calling the ambulance because it was so scary -- thought I was having a stroke. Ended up being completely cleared; nothing was 'wrong' and the medics diagnosed it as an anxiety attack (I have never had an anxiety attack or clinical anxiety of any sort). After reading other reviews where something similar happened to other people, I am certain this antibiotic had something to do with what I experienced. I have been completely fine in the week since I finished the pills. It did cure my UTI though.",Kat

I am feeling anxious the vision problems are not helping with this. I'm concerned and thinking this is a dangerous drug and maybe the dosage too is too high or just simply a dangerous drug. Oh, I still feel the UTI symptoms too. I was in the first half of my prescription when this started, I've called the doctor and have not heard back I plan to call or go tomorrow.

I had no idea this drug could affect lungs, if I'd known I would never have taken it as I have had breathing problems in the past. I had a mild UTI, and was prescribed 3 day course (2 tablets per day). Shortness of breath and discomfort in lungs happened almost immediately, and was very distressing. My ventolin inhaler made almost no difference - I almost went to A and E. I was also extremely lethargic, palpitations, and tingling/numb hands. Then mood swings, weird angry outbursts followed by nearly a whole day of crying!! Absolutely horrible, but so glad I looked up this drug and realised what was happening.

On day one I didn’t really think much of the medicine because I took it a little bit before eating some food so I figured that the nausea was coming from not taking it immediately with food. Day two I took the medication with food but I had nausea and just feeling of unwellness and was a little spacey. On day three that’s when I got a rash right after I took it my arms were itchy my face was hot and itchy. I started to have a heart palpitations so I took a nap but the headache was so intense I wasn’t able to go to sleep. The nausea was horrible and I just had a knot in my throat like I felt like I was gonna throw up. This is when I realize that this medication was really making me feel incredibly horrible.

I treated the symptoms and after 48 hours after dose three (I stopped after that) I’m left with a headache but much better. It’s a side effect, I believe.

After several years at the age of approximately 67 she noticed that she was having problems with taking a deep breath and she could no longer yawn!  She made an appointment with her primary care doctor and he took a chest x-ray.  Unfortunately the x-ray showed massive scarring in her lungs and she was diagnosed with Macrodantin poisoning.  She  immediately stopped the Macrodantin and was put on oxygen 24 hrs/day.  A  week later she collapsed and was rushed to the hospital.

I did read up on this medication before taking it. I have to admit I was a little leary of how I would react.

It comes from poop, is what my doctor said. I thought I was wiping right, but must not have been. Anyway, the first dose took the smell of ammonia away. I am very happy with this antibiotic.

I was prescribed it this week and have taken two pills so far. I won't be taking the rest. I've spent the night feeling nauseous and have woken up this morning with stomach cramps, a bad headache, weak arms, hot flushes and fatigue. I feel weepy and sick and I just want to go back to bed...which is kind of impossible because I have an 18 month old. Incidentally, her night was disturbed (we're still breastfeeding) and I can only assume it's something to do with the antibiotic because the crying and screaming was very out of character her.

The morning of day three is when I had to pull over my car because I thought I was having a stroke and my friend rushed me to the ER. The day before I had weird arm cramps, abdominal cramps and headache but thought it was due to a possible UTI - then while driving my head felt extreme pressure, my vision blurred, my jaw started chattering, both my arms had numbness down through my hands and my speech was slurred. I am an extremely healthy and athletic 31 year old with no pre existing conditions. When I went to the ER all of my tests came back normal and they sent me home. I immediately stopped taking the medication and continued to have these random episodes over the next few days that were less extreme. A week later I am still weak and tired, my primary doctor told me it could be a week to two weeks to work it way out of my system. I’m worried it did permanent damage!",Moe

But here’s what I did. My UTI was definitely full on, but I caught it early so decided to just take 1 pill per day instead of two. The first pill made all the burning go away thank goodness. But I took it at night with minimal food. BIG mistake. I suffered headaches, nausea and fatigue all the next day. Sucked. But then I started doing this and it made all the difference: eat a full meal, take the pill  with 1,000mg of vitamin C and a glass of water, then eat some bread and drink more water. Take several vitamin C pills throughout the day too. If you have a UTI, supplement all this with d-mannose, horsetail capsules, and straight cranberry juice. Everyone is different but I got the bad symptoms until I did this, so it’s worth a go. I felt zero nausea and zero headaches today.",Bree

Took the next dose in the morning and then it all hit me. Extreme dizziness, tiredness, the most intense headache, horrible lower abdomen cramps and a general feeling of out of it. By day three the cramps got so much worse, thought I had bowel cancer or appendicitis! Went back to the clinic and all of the touch tests didn’t indicate anything. I finally realized it was the Nitro so I stopped taking them and the cramps eased slightly, no more headache and dizziness after 24 hours.

Went to emergency department by ambulance.The antibiotic had caused acute liver failure. I had been on day 5 of a 7 day course. Lucky enough the doctor in the hospital put the connection together and medication was stopped. It took a few months to recover from the fatigue especially but I'm lucky to be alive also.

141,Nitrofurantoin,Urinary Tract Infection,9.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"March 15, 2021",2,I've taken nitrofurantoin about 3 or 4 times in the past 2 years. First time was for a very bad UTI and it made me feel better instantly after the first dose. I was only prescribed 3 days worth and the infection had not totally cleared so had to go back for some more but after that it went. The second time I had a UTI I didn't get seen to soon enough and I was feverish - they prescribed nitrofurantoin but at that point it had spread so it wasn't strong enough so was put on cipro. The latest UTI I got seen to straight away and the tablets are making me feel nauseous for about 1hr after taking my dose and generally queasy/stomach and bowel upsets. My advice is to take it with BIG meals that line your stomach to avoid the nausea. I'd recommend the drug and remember you will always see more negative press than positive!,Utisufferer

It has also spread to my bottom, causing THE most painful rash. Using the restroom burns and hurts so bad I get nauseated from the pain. I suffered with a UTI for 2 weeks and this medication helps well with that, so I'm coping with the side effects and praying for all around relief.",butterflyangelwings

Doc thought it was  lung inflammation due to drug.  She changed nitrofurantoin to another med, but two weeks later am still having these side effects.  She said all antibiotics are pesticides for killing germs, ie bacteria, that can get into places in the body where they don’t belong.

Side effects were: nausea & a low-grade fever. I also experienced tiredness, dizziness & certain smells were weird.What helped: prebiotics like pickles, sauerkraut, etc for the nausea, eating simple foods & avoiding alcohol, spicy food & caffeine & avoiding sugar because that feeds the bacteria you’re trying to kill. Keeping well hydrated, using a hot water bottle/heated pad for comfort & sleeping.Overall: I mean, it works, so 7/10.

I'm not exactly sure of the cause but it came on after overdoing it working in the garden in hot weather. I went to the doctor after 2 days and she put me on a 10-day course of nitrofurotoin. The side effect I feel is that I have very low energy and I need to go and lie down from time to time; but if the body is fighting an infection I am not surprised by this. I walk the dog each day (at a slower tempo than normal) and continue with some basic yoga. The symptoms of the UTI are much better but I have a few days of the course of tablets.,Kipper

At first my nitrofurantoin side effects were not too bad, although early on it gave me cold hands and a tight chest and a strange cold unwell feeling. Initially these passed off quite quickly but the longer I took it, the longer and worse the side effects became and lasted.  By the end I was feeling very ill and I  still felt very ill for a week afterwards. It is ten days now and I still feel poorly. I managed to feel a bit better by having an antihistamine each morning to counteract it. I would never take it again. My UTI meant I was peeing out red-brown urine and as that is also a side effect of taking nitrofurantoin, so I did not know if I was cured or not. But a week after stopping it, I am back to peeing red urine again. So not cured. I am about to try co-amoxiclav . (I was taking 100mg nitrofurantoin twice a day for 7 days.

I think it irritates your bladder as do all antibiotics so during the course of your treatment, drink lots of water, not cranberry juice, if your bladder still hurts.  It can take a few days for your bladder to feel better.  It is probably red and sore inside.  So go when you have to go and drink lots of fluids (water) and flush that bacteria out of you.  If you get the side effects I've seen in a lot of posts, you're probably allergic.  I've had two reactions to different antibiotics and ended up in the emergency room.  Allergies isn't the fault of the medication.  Just be careful and pay attention and don't take chances.  You can become allergic to anything at any time.  I did.  The best thing to take when you're taking an antibiotic is a 90 billion probiotic and the refrigerated kind.

In fact, I was given 2 glasses of water to drink. The doctor didn't give me any more drugs but told me to wait for 7 days to elapse and get back for testing and we start afresh. Luckily, I healed when I went back, but to be honest, I can't recommend this drug to any patient. The drug is not humans who have daily errands.",Mike

Too many people claim to have bad experiences, bad side effects from this medicine because they have read others negative reviews, and the power of suggestion causes too many people to manifest every bad reaction instantly. The claims that this medication made sicker within a such a short time after first dose is ridiculous.The only reaction anyone would have to a medication that fast is an allergic reaction, allergic reactions are serious and should not be ignored. It's quite possible that the UTI may get worse until medication starts working.

Most of these are preventable/treatable with headache pills, taking it with lots of food, and probiotics. If you are allergic, that is not the fault of the medicine, nor is it yours. That's just the way the cards were dealt.Macrobid, or nitrofurantoin, is very good for UTI treatment and the methods it does so makes bacteria unlikely to build resistance to it. Macrobid should be the first option before general antibiotics for this reason.Macrobid works very well and usually is taken twice daily (breakfast, dinner).

After having my youngest child I came down with a UTI which stemmed from the birthing  unit nurse  improperly inserting a catheter prior to my cesarean section delivery. Within about a week I began noticing some tenderness in my lower pelvic area but thought perhaps it was because I had a tubal ligation and c- section and returned to work upon my discharge from the hospital (yeah not the most health wise move but childbirth doesn't stop the bills from flowing in). I was put on antibiotics that didn't work ended up admitted with severly infected kidneys and macrobid was the only thing that cured me and to this day is the only antibiotic that works for my UTI's,AP42

I am considering coming off these pills only 2 days in to a 7 day cycle as for me the side effects are almost worse than the UTI.",Anonymous

I was struggling with UTI long time. I tried Cefalexin and it didn't work for me. I did try Augmentin as I never had problem with this one and it's really strong but I started to vomit after 2 hours of taking the pill. Macrodantin can be good choice for people with sensitive stomach. I had no side effects.,Monihrin

I am allergic to all other medications and therefore this is all I have to work with. It works well, doesn't always work for me. Sometimes I have to take a second week of it. I often feel the same way as others. Headache if I haven't drank enough water, upset stomach if I hadn't ate enough food when taking the pill. It does make me tired as well. I try to eat well when I am on this medication to help with the energy level since I am allergic to caffeine and can't take that path. I think that if you make sure to take the pill with lots of food like they recommend, the nausea isn't that bad. Also, drinking more water then your ever use to, will help with the headaches.",Sebbietash
