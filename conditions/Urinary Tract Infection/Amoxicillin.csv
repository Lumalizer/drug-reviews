0,Amoxicillin,Urinary Tract Infection,3.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"September 25, 2021",1,"I had a minor UTI and was prescribed a 5 day course of 500mg 3x a day. Originally my doctor wanted to give me macrobid but that always gives me nausea so I asked for something different. I think it was a mistake since the amoxicillin didn't seem to help much. To start with, my symptoms were extremely mild, mostly it was urgency to go when I was trying to sleep and a bit of ache down below. Amoxicillin help a bit with the symptoms but after my 5 day course I could still feel the infection lingering. I gave it a few days to see if it was just my body recovering but within 3 days of finishing I was getting up every 10 min before bed again. I scheduled a urine culture and in the meantime took Azo Defense (which actually reduced symptoms FASTER). I suppose if I had a 7 or 10 day course it might have cleared the infection but I also didn't like the side effects. I felt like I had a rapid heart rate all the time and kept debating if I should go to the ER.",H.W.
1,Amoxicillin,Urinary Tract Infection,3.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"August 28, 2020",11,"I thought Amoxicillin was pretty mild. I asked for it when my Urologist prescribed a Cipro-family antibiotic (I think those are REALLY dangerous!)...WRONG.  I took the Amoxicillin 500mg 2X/day for 8 days and had to stop. It seemed to stop my UTI (first one ever and I have been on catheters for 2 years) but I didn't expect the side effects of  rapid heart rate all the time, anxiety from low grade to intense most of the time, it made me feel weak and nauseous, guts in turmoil, eating anything made it worse, so I  had to stop.  I had no idea this drug had those side effects for many!  AVOID!",AZ JJ
2,Amoxicillin,Urinary Tract Infection,7.0,,"May 27, 2020",28,"I’ve taken Amoxicillin many times for a UTI. It gives me a good amount of relief within 6-8 hours. The burning sensation and the bladder spasms usually subside within that time frame. I don’t experience many side effects except for occasional mild nausea and an annoying yeast infection. Those side effects are very common. I’ve also taken this for tonsil issues and it helps tremendously. There’s not many antibiotics I can take, but this is one of my favorites for my lupus induced UTIs.",Amb

4,Amoxicillin,Urinary Tract Infection,,Taken for 10 years or more,"January 10, 2020",82,"I have had frequent UTIs since I was a kid and I still get them every couple of months. Amoxicillin has always worked for me. My doctor tried to change it up this time around and give me Bactrim. It was awful. It did nothing for my UTI, and just made me feel super dizzy and tired all day. So I went back and she gave me Macrobid. I told her that amoxicillin has always worked for me but she insisted I try the Macrobid. Still in constant pain, the frequency, all of it is still there. Amoxicillin is THE ONLY one that works for me. I am going back tomorrow and insisting on the amoxicillin. I KNOW MY BODY.",Chica95
5,Amoxicillin,Urinary Tract Infection,10.0,Taken for 10 years or more,"December 6, 2019",11,"I am paraplegic since an accident in 2002, and you know, para- and quadriplecics are collectors of bacteria in the bladder. As long as the human immune system is able to hold a balance, these bacteria are quiet, but after one is changing the daily routine, get fever, don't drink enough or what else, they begin immediately to reproduce them and a new UTI is born again....Well, you should never take an antibiotic without to do a urine culture first at a lab, to choose the right medicine afterwards and to be sure it will work, otherwise the chance is real you chose the wrong one one and it doesn't help you. That doesn't mean this antibiotic is of a poor quality, but it will not help just because the bacteria that caused the UTI is resistant against this kind of antibiotic. In that case you threatened your health for nothing, because all this kind of medicine is damaging your liver, and a damaged liver may be the death penalty!",Rudy
6,Amoxicillin,Urinary Tract Infection,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"December 1, 2019",20,I am 87 and was one of the first to use penicillin for strep throat.

7,Amoxicillin,Urinary Tract Infection,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"November 27, 2019",7,"I had more sex than usual this month. I seem to be more active in November ;p. I suspect that it was the cause. So, this is also a potential cause as well. And finally, I noticed that with the summers heat and humidity setting in, it is potentially a cause that would aggravate the condition.Penicillin(500mg)  twice daily has stopped the ""labor pains"" for me twice so far after getting fed up of hospital visits and pethidine(poppy extract). I respect the advice about taking probiotics in conjunction. Would certainly not harm to replace any good that was removed with the antibiotic.P.S. Washing the hands is about the most important thing to do before commencing ANY new activity.",hornyman

I had sweating, anxiety, panic attacks, had to stop, given I am not the coolest of people and this tipped me over the edge.  But in amoxycillin's defence it did in the short space stop the burning wee, as for whether its totally cured the UTI I do not know, I need a break before trying the Nitrofurantoin they now have prescribed.",carlton1

I took it a lot for strep throat, as well as before dental procedures. I recently took it for a UTI and it worked within a day. No side effects at all. All medication comes with risks, but this is a better choice than Fluroquinolones or some of the other types of antibiotics on the market.

21,Amoxicillin,Urinary Tract Infection,10.0,,"January 10, 2017",134,"I was born with 4 kidneys, and it seems some of the other reviewers ""side effects"" were actually kidney/bladder infection symptoms. These infections spread fast, and can be lethal. Amoxacillin is a gentle savior for me, I still have 3 of 4 kidneys, after surgery and countless urinary tract infections, I trust it very much. It can take as little as 2 days to go from UTI to bladder, and a day or so more to kidneys, nip it in the bud, at first stinging. Because if you start to feel constipated,  it's probably not, that is a kidney infection symptom. These infections scare the daylights out of me, it has been quite a while since I was hospitalized, amoxacillin is safe and much easier on the body than cipro.",lilyjulia1
22,Amoxicillin,Urinary Tract Infection,9.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"December 17, 2016",115,"I've had many bladder infections over the years, to varying degrees-- and Amoxicillin has always worked for me, personally, when it comes to the worst of them.  But everyone is different, so if it doesn't help your infection go away, switch to another antibiotic, but be warned that the current push is to prescribe a powerful class of antibiotics called fluoroquinolone, that have a rare, but potentially permanent side effect of nerve damage (and warning states that the effect can happen AFTER you've taken the medication).  So, given the choice of antibiotics, I'd take Amoxicillin first.  Yes, there are side effects, but minor and temporary.  Just take probiotics, eat well, hydrate.",Frequent UTIs

I got extreme exhaustion and muscle weakness. I couldn't even lift my arms without feeling exhausted. I got really irritable and extreme mood swings (yelling, crying). I got heart palipitations and extreme anxiety/paranoia. Strange rubber feeling in mouth, weird thoughts. On day 4 I started hallucinating a bit (nothing extreme but it was terrifying). Every muscle in my body aches. Oh and I checked to see if my infection improved with an at home test and it's still there!

27,Amoxicillin,Urinary Tract Infection,7.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"March 21, 2016",126,So. Amoxicillin works fantastic for a UTI BUT I'd never ever take it w/out a probiotic. I get a bottle of acidophilus (maybe a few billion cultures)  at a big box store for under $6.  Reason being is antibiotics kill bacteria both good and bad. My daughter gets thrush and Ive NEVER had a yeast infection until on amoxicillin for over 3 days. These Are side effects of good bacteria being killed off.

30,Amoxicillin,Urinary Tract Infection,10.0,,"October 12, 2015",221,I had been having abdominal and pelvic pain for over three weeks thinking that it was menstrual related.  Once my cycle was over I noticed that there was blood in my urine and immediately knew that it was a urinary tract and or bladder infection.  I got a prescription for amoxicillin and within an hour of taking the first dose which was two pills my pain had subsided from an 8 to a 5 on a scale of 1 to 10.  Several hours later I was immediately feeling back to myself and ready to get out and start living again. The pain of the bladder infection or urinary tract infection had literally kept me in the house with a heating pad on for three weeks almost a month.
