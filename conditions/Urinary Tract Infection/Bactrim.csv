0,Bactrim,Urinary Tract Infection,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"March 29, 2022",0,"I was prescribed Bactrim after two other antibiotics failed to cure my UTI, and let me tell you, not only it did not work, but I also had a violent allergic reaction to it.I was suffering from my first UTI (first from many to come sadly). The symptoms went away pretty quickly after taking the first pill but came back after I stopped to take the medicine two days later. From what I remember I got really sick: chills, high fever, nausea, complete loss of appetite, extreme fatigue, and red patches all over my body but especially on my arms/ legs and chest. I had swollen lips for first indication but as I was young I didn’t understand it at first. When I went back to the doctor, he said it was a pretty powerful medicine and that he knew beforehand that a risk of allergy was higher than other medicines. I don’t hold it against him though, it was very frustrating not to find anything that would work to cure this UTI.",Lolo

2,Bactrim,Urinary Tract Infection,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"March 17, 2022",1,I was given Bactrim to treat a urinary tract infection. After 2 days of being on the drug I started to develop hives all over my body. Even on the soles of feet and palms of my hands. The itching is so horrible. I went to urgent care and they prescribed a steroid and hydroxyzine for the itching. Prior to this I had no allergies whatsoever not even seasonal allergies. I would ask for an antibiotic that does not contain sulfacetamide.  I also read the reviews here and wasn't worried because I never had any problems,Maire

4,Bactrim,Urinary Tract Infection,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"February 27, 2022",3,I've been taking bactrim since Friday it's now Sunday. My doctor told me it's a urinary tract infection but only symptoms I'm having is the urge to pee with little urine. Vaginal itching that comes and go with discharge. I'm ready to stop the medicine but I know I can't. I've missed two doses because the side effects are me feeling dizzy feeling nausea a bad headache and lost of appetite.  I don't know what to do I feel like if I stop taking it for a possible UTI it won't go away . But I don't feel it's a UTI cuz I'm not having burning when I pee only after I pee I have itchy feeling that I want to scratch with tissue but I know I can't do that either. I really need help and I hope someone see this that can give me honest answers .. I've been to the health unit and two hospitals they've all gave different results ..,LouisianaMyStat

The first time I took it was so weak, dizzy, confused and my heart rate was through the roof. Even going up the stairs or getting up out of bed winded me and I’m completely healthy. It was so bad I’d sleep all day just hoping the symptoms would go away but I can’t take the side effects the rapid heart beat and feeling of constant anxiety. I have never felt this weak from medication. Also it has given me a pounding aura headache that just makes me extremely dizzy and exhausted I’m stopping this medication immediately and contacting my doctor this is horrible.

8,Bactrim,Urinary Tract Infection,,Taken for less than 1 month,"January 28, 2022",0,"While I understand that people who do not have many side effects from meds may think it's a mind over matter thing... some people do experience adverse effects that are seemingly unbearable. I am now myself on Bactrim.  Fatigued, depressed, irritable and having nightmares.  These side effects haven't gone away even with the best probiotics.  I still have another week to go and so I basically have to just suck it up and do the best I can.  However, to those of you who can't relate to those of us who have side effects that aren't related to the infection ... please try to be more understanding!  Thank you.",Renee F

As soon I took the drug my vagina started to itch so bad, I thought it was a yeast infection or something, then my vagina got so swollen I couldn't explain. I took only two doses and stopped, next day I was in horrible pain went to three drs to finally get a gyno to checked me he was horrified said I had a wound in my vulva, gave me some stuff that is finally giving me relief, also got my tongue so sore I can't barely eat, and the Drs doesn't care, my scalp is so sensitive I was about to call an ambulance when I got out of the shower my head felt on fire. I'm beyond traumatized after this experience and praying to God I don't have any other problems with this drug.  Could this be a Fixed drug eruption?",Sofía

I experienced dizziness, weakness and muscle cramps, especially in my hands and feet. The worst of it was a cluster headache episode that was debilitating. I just finished up the three days of Bactrim so I’m hoping these side effects wear off. UTI is cleared. Wouldn’t recommend for a mild UTI.",Faith0908

Do not take on empty stomach or just a glass of water.  I should see results in two days.  I had burning when I pee, and that's a sure sign of start of UTI infection or kidney infection on it's way.   After the first pill, I felt hot, but that's easily doable and just wear cotton clothes.   He also said to keep drinking lots of water when taking this medicine or a kidney stone could develop.  So I  kept drinking lots of water.  It's been two days and I feel a lot better. My PCP prescribed a prescription for 7 days and said to finish it out and I will.",Anna

I recommend this medication. Note that everyone is different and not cookie cutter. Not every med is for every body. The only side effects I've had is slight pressure in lower throat, very slight increase in anxiety (but I'm medicated for that), and being overly tired. IDK what's up with the fatigue of it all, but it's a bad fatigue. Unnatural body weakness and feeling of lethargy. I would rate it 10/10 if it weren't for the sleepiness alone. It works though. It works so good!",Brenna
13,Bactrim,Urinary Tract Infection,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"January 6, 2022",0,"I have a fairly mild UTI and it has been many years since I last had one. I decided to go on antibiotics to ensure the UTI wouldn’t turn into anything more severe. I have been prescribed Bactrim for 3 days, and instructed to take 1 tablet every 12 hours (total of 6 pills). So far, no noticeable side effects. I am on day 2. I am generally medication compliant and have never experienced any serious reactions from taking medication. I think doing your part and taking care of your body by eating healthy and exercising is helpful while taking any antibiotic, including getting enough sleep. The pill itself is a medium size. Not the smallest but also not big to the point where it is difficult to swallow. I no longer have the urge to pee not do I feel any burning sensation when peeing, so the meds started working quickly! So far so good!",Anonymous

15,Bactrim,Urinary Tract Infection,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"December 6, 2021",0,I took Bactrim for a bad UTI. I could notice a difference in 3 hours on my symptoms. Clear in two days. No side effects at all. Took with water and sometimes food. I was scared after reading the reviews and don’t like to take new medications. I would take again if I had to.

16,Bactrim,Urinary Tract Infection,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"November 27, 2021",0,"TLDR; This drug CAN be a nightmare. I finally went to the doctor for my mild UTI. Water just wouldn't kick it. After my first dose, I was immediately thankful that I had gotten it. To my surprise, after taking the first dose, it seemed my infection had spread to my bladder. That night was awful bladder spasms and private area burning like fire. Before I took the medication, I only had slight burning with urination. The next day I pushed water like crazy and thought I was getting better. The meds made me speedy. I was in a fog, but was getting things done. I felt very sickly. I thought, again, that it was a good thing I got the antibiotics because my infection must be super severe to make me this ill. That night I got very short of breath and my heart was pounding. I thought I may have caught covid. I tried to sleep. Through the night I was awake with awful thoughts of death and severe anxiety. The next morning woke with my heart pounding and severe anxiety. I felt like death still.",Meg

I became horrendously ill after the 2nd pill, muscle aches, muscle weakness, dizziness, rapid heart rate, feeling faint, and feeling like I couldn’t concentrate. Tried calling my dr to ask if I could go down to one pill a day as 2 felt too much, they didn’t call me back until 3 days later because of the weekend. By then I took it upon myself to only take one pill a day and my dr said that was a good decision. With one pill a day the most I felt was a slight headache and slight loss of appetite, but my UTI symptoms continued to get worse so I was put on cipro. Praying the cipro works for me now.",JenaLee

19,Bactrim,Urinary Tract Infection,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"October 28, 2021",0,"This stuff should be taken off the market! I took this for a UTI. As soon as it got in my system good, I began to feel fatigued and nauseated. Stomach cramps got worse and I just generally did not feel well. Actually I felt worse than I did with the UTI! After 4 days on it, I developed achy joints (particularly my knees), and the nausea was unbearable. My eyes felt completely dilated and I just felt like I was overdosing on this stuff. My kidney's even started hurting! And yes, I know to take antibiotics with food ( I made the mistake of not doing so once, never again!). I stopped taking it and went back to the doctor who also recommended me to stop taking Bactrim. The dosage was the generic 800/160 2X a day. I think this is WAY too strong a dosage for some people and doctors need to stop just prescribing this stuff without taking into account what each individual person's body may be able to handle.",Ren India
20,Bactrim,Urinary Tract Infection,8.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"October 27, 2021",0,"Started taking Bactrim for a severe UTI. I try to heal my body naturally, in this case I tried 100% cranberry juice along with D mannatose and a probiotic before seeing a dr. Sometimes medicine is just necessary. But with that being said my body is not used to meds at all. To my surprise, the side effects have been bearable. It took about 2 doses (1 full day) to feel relief. Pretty quick in my opinion. I will say I’m extremely fatigued. I’ve been taking naps daily that’s how tired I feel. I’ve also become extremely constipated. That’s probably the worst side effect I’m dealing with but I’m hoping it subsides as I just finished my last dose this morning. Otherwise, not too bad!",Cece

Previously a 5 day course of amoxicillin failed to rid my UTI. I don't think I started to feel better until day 7 but even though I'm now done with the course I still have slight UTI symptoms and test strips still show slight traces. I'm guessing I have a resistant strain of bacteria so I'm going to call my doctor for yet a 3rd antibiotic (I'm guessing Cipro will be next). Overall I did not have any scary symptoms. No upset stomach, no rashes or hives, no headaches. I usually ate a small snack beforehand but always drank a full glass of water with each dose (and tried to drink more through the day as well as recommended). I did my best to stay indoor and wear sunscreen too. I will say on the 7th day I did feel like the skin on my arms were a little sensitive and itchy. Like maybe the start of a rash but it's possible my seasonal allergies were kicking in (I avoided taking Claritin since I didn't know if I could).",H.W.

25,Bactrim,Urinary Tract Infection,,Taken for less than 1 month,"August 24, 2021",1,"Several years ago I was prescribed a twice a day for seven days dose for UTI. After 3 days, I was in ICU fighting for my life due to severe reaction to Bactrim. Started as severe body aches and vomiting, by day 3 was admitted to ICU for anaphylactic shock. Recently, I was prescribed a different antibiotic(unfortunately can't recall name) for a tooth infection. After 3 days I was so very sick, I thought I was dying. I literally thought I had Covid. A voice whispered ""antibiotic"", I looked up ingredients and it too was a sulfa based drug. Stopped taking medication and within a day, I was much better, thank God! So, based on my experience with Bactrim and other sulfa based drugs, I would rate it 1 due to my severe allergy. But it did do a fantastic job of clearing up the UTI!

Weak feeling all over body and loss of strength after doing something simple such as throwing out the trash. Bactrim MAY give you brain fog and feelings of depersonalization-it may also affect your electrolyte levels. Be prepared for possible psychotic effects on your brain and not knowing why you are losing yourself/mind. More importantly, watch for the development of pernicious anemia. Again, this may not happen to EVERYONE but watch yourself carefully while on this drug. This won't cure EVERY UTI. Before you take this, BEG your doctor to CULTURE your urine so that you will be put on the ""right"" antibiotics. This interferes with your body's ability to breakdown Folate into a useable form and can interfere with your bone marrow WHICH produces red blood cells.",Mabel

Panic attack where I could barely even talk, eyes were bugging out. I am not a mentally ill person in any way and I have never felt this way before in my life the way this pill made me feel. I almost didn’t know it was the drug until I checked this website and read that everyone and their mothers have experienced severe anxiety caused by this pill. Doctor told me it doesn’t cause anxiety to continue taking it today so it looks like I won’t be listening to them after reading a web page full of people with complaints of severe anxiety and panic. I also definitely felt like I was losing myself/my mind without knowing why as someone has mentioned on here before.

Day 2 UTI slight urgency but manageable- that night had anxiety attack and heart palpitations. By day 4 exhausted, hardly able to do my daily work. I called my dr on day 5 and she said this is normal - to just power through and since I’m allergic to penicillin I’m likely not allergic to Sulfa. That night had chills and a 100 degree fever. Day 6 I felt even worse (chills and fever) and developed hives. Was told I have a Sulfa allergy and to stop with the meds and start Macrobid. The next day with Bactrim leaving my system I developed a full body rash that made me look sunburned and had a 103 degree fever. The rash subsided 6 days after it started and my other symptoms ended 3 days after I stopped the pills. Overall, one of the worst medical experiences of my adult life.

I had debilitating kidney pain and lower back pain, severe gas, foamy explosive diarrhea, bloating, racing heart rate, severe anxiety (almost to the point of paranoia), and brain fog. I could not even hold a simple conversation. I felt like I was dying. After reading many reviews online, I discovered these same side effects have affected so many others while taking Bactrim.

Know that you’re taking this because you have an infection, and that in itself can make you feel miserable. A lot of these side effects mentioned are parallel with symptoms of a significant infection. So there’s that. Take AFTER you eat. Not a bite of banana. Eat a good meal- Take with a full bottle of water- I took mine with benedryl due to the fact my skin gets itchy ( not a rash) I also took a GOOD probiotic to counter any gut microbiome disruption. Eat bananas- simple foods- not greasy meals. Avoid extra sun exposure or anything that will zap you.
