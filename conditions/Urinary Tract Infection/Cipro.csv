0,Cipro,Urinary Tract Infection,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"December 4, 2021",0,"Took this drug two times. One time I ended up puking non stop and the doctor felt it was a fluke but prescribed me something else. Second time when I got a bladder infection and was prescribed Cipro, I had extreme leg pain. Barely could walk so the doctor sent me to the ER thinking it was a blood clot. Nope. Stopped Cipro and I got better. Apparently this is not unusual with Cipro. Not comfortable at all using this drug and do not recommend it. It was a nightmare. I believe this drug is a black box drug if I remember correctly",Dog lover
1,Cipro,Urinary Tract Infection,7.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"June 24, 2021",4,"For the last 10 years, I have suffered from regular bladder infections. Last week I ended up in hospital with a serious bladder. I was weeing blood and the pain of weeing was the worst pain I had ever experienced. It was so painful that I nearly fainted a couple of times.After taking my first tablet of Cipro, the pain had decreased by about half. I took Cipro for 5 days (2 tablets a day). I have given it a 7/10 as even though it works very quickly, and for me didn’t get any symptoms, I don’t feel like my infection has totally disappeared. I am worried that it’s going to come back. My stomach is still bloated and I need to go to the toilet nonstop. Really not sure what to do…",Rosie646

Was prescribed 500 mg ciproflaxen 2X a day for 7 days.  Within 4 hours I started to feel better.  Pain and urgency to urinate decreased dramatically.

6,Cipro,Urinary Tract Infection,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"January 31, 2020",87,"Prescribed Cipro every 12 hours for a urinary infection, but only took 3 doses as my side effect felt terrible. I had the worse headache I’ve ever felt. IT felt like there was so much pressure in my head that it could explode. My muscles started to ache and my body would tingle. I had absolutely no energy, and felt like my brain wasn’t even working, and like I was in a different body. Complete disconnect from reality. Troubles staying asleep at night, and just laid awake in pain. Back pain, neck stiffness, and my vision blurred. Worst thing I have ever experienced. Called my doctor before I was suppose to take next dose to get something new and instantly felt better. Praying to God this new one works without the side effect as I’m terrified to feel that way ever again.",HL33
7,Cipro,Urinary Tract Infection,8.0,,"January 25, 2020",37,"I unfortunately got a UTI during a trip in Bali and was prescribed cipro 500 for a 10 day course from a clinic here. My dr back home said try it for 3 days and if I still have problems push it to 5 days. I HATE taking meds, so after reading a ton of reviews and side effects for this drug I was very hesitant to take it. I waited 3 days until I couldn’t take it anymore and was in unbearable pain to finally start the course. I felt so much better day 1 and fortunately day 3 I’m feeling back to normal and luckily no major side effects except slight itchiness all over within the first few hours and a little bit of chest pressure (probably anxiety from taking this!) I actually felt more alert than normal. I’m going to stop today and hopefully will remain feeling good. I am rating this an 8 because it’s a heavy duty antibiotic and I think there are other choices I could’ve taken that aren’t as strong, for an uncomplicated uti- but that’s all they had available here.",C

I have been in 8 rounds of antibiotics and nothing is completely ridding me of my UTI I did a CT scan and MRI and blood work and all is clear.

I can’t take cephalosporins because of allergies or macrobid because it caused gastric bleeding (talk about making things worse...). Cipro has worked like a charm for me every time, with no side effects. For some reason doctors always say Cipro isn’t their first choice for UTIs, but since I’m allergic to the usual go-to’s, this works for me. I’ve had some doctors provide a 3-day course, others 7-day. I would ask about dosage. Seems to me there are some doctors who overmedicate, particularly urgent care. My doc always prescribes 3-day. Urgent care has always given 7. Worth asking, is all I’m saying. As someone who got allergic to some antibiotics by taking them too much (for UTIs), I’m always nervous about taking extra antibiotics than needed, but be careful to get a drs opinion - don’t stop early or you can end up with bigger problems (like a recurring infection that’s now immune to that antibiotic)",Relief Please

I’m 19 from the UK and was getting recurrent UTIs no matter what I did to prevent them. 2 rounds of nitrofurnantion & trimethoprim didn’t do the trick and symptoms were awful and in a lot of pain/discomfort.

Don’t let the side effects scare you, and to be honest, even if I did happen to get side effects, it is a balancing act of relief or side effects anytime you take meds.
