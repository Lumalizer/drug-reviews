0,Ciprofloxacin,Urinary Tract Infection,3.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"February 23, 2022",0,"I was prescribed it for a kidney infection that I may or may not have had. They did no further testing besides a urinalysis to see if I had an STI. I took it from Wed to Sun and stopped taking it Sunday due to nausea. Now it is Tuesday evening and I am still nauseous, feel dissociated and weak. This drug is the only antibiotic with a BLACK BOX WARNING it should not be prescribed unless very serious. Try bactrim for that. The adverse reactions are muscle pains, tendon rupture, GI upset, nausea, vomiting, low blood sugar, and mental health effects. I have been struggling with my mental health and now this is added on top of it. I should have known better than to take this med.",Olivia
1,Ciprofloxacin,Urinary Tract Infection,9.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"February 11, 2022",0,"I woke up one morning with sharp UTI pain out of nowhere. I was prescribed Cipro and because am phobic to drugs side effects I came here to read Cipro reviews and was stunned at the negative experience that I decided not to take it. But after comparing it to other antibiotics I thought it Cipro might be  less harmful so I decided to give it a try. My Dr said I should take 2 tablets one in the morning, one at night. The first pill caused some bloating but nothing major. The second one was tolerable too. I am now on day 4 and Zero side effects. I should stop on day 5 as per my Dr but I will go for two more days to avoid recurrence. To sum it up, everyone reacts differently to a certain drug, so you have to tread carefully.I am on Cipro for 4 days now and all pain has gone. It works so far. Will update this post in a month from now to give you long term results. Be safe you all.",Meema2007

I went back to the dr who retested for the UTI and also did a CBC and said everything was normal and to finish out the antibiotic. Even though I was still having the burning sensation from the UTI, and the high fever and migraines I was told everything was normal from their tests. Later that day I was in the ER from my temp being almost 103. They did every test under the sun including more blood work, CT scan of my stomach plus several other tests. They ended up telling me it was a fever of unknown origin and back spasms but couldn't explain the rest of my symptoms. I was sent home and told to continue the cipro and tylenol for the fever. After 2 more days of this fever and pain I was in, I decided to stop the cipro myself. Almost immediately started feeling better. This med is dangerous!",Tngirl

You need to eat a big meal 30min before you take the meds, & you’ll be GOOD! I’m 27, 93lbs female. This medicine took care of my symptoms with one pill, but I finished all 6 days. Like many have said, urgent care tends to over-medicate, so I felt that 6 days was more than enough since I caught the UTI super early. So far I have had no other side effects, beside a minor case of itchy vagina, which is common because this medication gets rid of both bad and good bacteria. 2.5L of water a day should care of any potential yeast overgrowth.

I followed instructions, taking one every 12 hours. Cut dairy out of my diet. Bottom line is that it did not work at all. There was a marginal improvement after a couple of days. Then things stayed the same for days. By day 9 and 10, my UTI felt a bit worse, and more worrying, was that now my prostate was beginning to feel inflamed as the infection was backing up and spreading. This drug did not work for me. I researched and found out that Cipro is no longer considered a ""front line"" drug for UTIs, and there is quite a lot of bacteria that is simply immune to this drug. I did not have some of the terrible symptoms other people had, apart from some morning headaches. I did generally feel a bit icky, and it's clearly a heavy duty drug.
