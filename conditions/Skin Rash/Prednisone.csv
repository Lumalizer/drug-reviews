0,Prednisone,Skin Rash,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"February 10, 2022",0,"I had surgery and as soon as I got to the 5th day of my 6-day tapered pack I started to see a rash develop. I thought it was from the adhesives used on the bandages and tape.  Well by day 7 I was popping Benadryl  and it was really doing nothing for the insane itching and rash that was growing everywhere.  I had my husband pull back the sheets because I thought a spider was in the bed biting me or something.  The rash was becoming lumpy and nodular to the touch. It looked as if I had mosquito bites and skin burns. My surgeon's asst. told me to go to urgent care. The urgent care doctor said yikes that's angry you need steroids. I was put on 60mg x4 days, 40mg x3 days, 20mg x3 days.  I took my first dose the next day as my prescription wasn't available that evening after leaving urgent care by nightfall I wasn't trying to scratch as much. The next morning 24 hours later the rash wasn't as raised as it was initially.  Day 2 I could still see red areas. Day 3 it's kinda gone.",MsZee
1,Prednisone,Skin Rash,7.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"December 26, 2021",0,"I get poison ivy rash about once every year or two. This year it was in two places on my body. Went to clinic in a drug store and was prescribed prednisone (10mg tablets) and Triamcinolone cream. Instruction were to take 40mg days 1&2, 30mg days 3, 20mg days 4, and 10mg days 5&6. I took as directed and used the cream 2-5 times a day. By the third day it was on 4 places on my body, day 4, five places and it continues to itch uncontrollably. This is day 6 and it still itches and is in at least 7 places. Like many others, I feel like the dosages were too low for me personally.  I'm 6'3"" and 185 pounds, which might have something to do with it. I have 20 more mg to take but I'm afraid its not going to do it. I'm still itching. Side affects included sleeplessness.",Itchy
2,Prednisone,Skin Rash,9.0,,"October 16, 2021",2,"I don’t even know what caused my rash. My doctor thinks I had an allergic reaction to some lotion or food but it seemed to be symmetrical on my underarm area, upper back and butt, outer thighs and calves. It felt so good to scratch but the itch at night was horrible I used ice bottles to rub. The prednisone worked quick and I also was prescribed an itch cream and antibiotics just in case. I also took Benadryl as needed. After completing meds I was a little itchy on lower back around spine and stomach, maybe now it’s just dry skin. Hopefully my body will take over and complete the healing. I give prednisone a 9 out of 10. Moderate side affects a small amount of head pressure and I ate a little more than normal.",Anonymous

4,Prednisone,Skin Rash,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"August 30, 2021",0,"Dermatologist put me on 50 mg prednisone to taper off in 20 days for Poison Ivy rash. My body reacted terribly to the pred….urination irregular; lots of abdominal distress; fatigue. After 4 days on the drug, covering doc got me down to 10 mg in just 4 days timing instead of 20 days. Terrible drug to take especially since poison ivy goes away on its own. PCP diagnosed me with stomach ulcer as a result of what he called a helluva high dose of prednisone .  So then I had to go on  meds for stomach. I don’t ever want to take this awful drug again nor will I ever return to that dermatologist.",Unhappy prednis
5,Prednisone,Skin Rash,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"August 20, 2021",0,"I had poison ivy and it was bad...I started with 40 mg for 2 days, 30 mg for 3 days, 20 mg for 2 days 10 mg for 1 day..after 2 hours of first dose itch was relieved,  blisters starting breaking after day 2 rash was getting better and it was pure relief after last dose. This is the only thing that has ever helped me....wish I could keep it on hand rather than running to  dr all the time. I had no side effects.",Squirrel
6,Prednisone,Skin Rash,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"August 11, 2021",2,"Poison ivy caused my skin rash so I went to Urgent Care.  The nurse practitioner prescribed a 14 day regimen.  4 days 60mg, 5 days 40mg, 5 days 20mg.  My blood pressure went up to 190/124 with a pulse rate of 150!!!  I just stopped after 2 days.  Blood pressure back to normal.  And poison ivy rash is much improved after only 2 days of taking.  Problems:  I told the nurse practitioner that I had blood pressure and an over large prostate, that I was taking medication for both issues.  Losartan for blood pressure.  Finasteride for prostate.  She told me no problem.  I found out later that prednisone decreases the efficiency of both Losartan and Finasteride.  Prednisone worked fast and great for the poison ivy.  BUT the side effects, for me, were LIFE THREATENING.  Not for me.  And be careful if you have high blood pressure, diabetes or prostate problems.  I thank God that I stopped the medication after only 2 days.",apalebluecow
7,Prednisone,Skin Rash,9.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"July 23, 2021",0,"I took it for about a week and it worked much better than cetirizine, acetaminophen, ibuprophen, which didn't seem to work on this in particular (I've had cetirizine work great for other stuff). IIRC oral steroid side effects are mostly long-term, but it worked great for 5 days for me. The pink round TL / 175 tablets are WAY too bitter and don't give any delay for the bitterness, and the bitter flavor sticks to the roof of my mouth. I think this is just the pill manufacturer's fault though and not the drug so I'm not taking off any points.",jasonofspoons
8,Prednisone,Skin Rash,10.0,,"June 27, 2021",6,I get bad poison ivy most summers. I generally try to just use homeopathy remedies like special soaps and salves like Green Goo. But I just got over a 3 week rash and managed to get it again all over my face and I woke up this morning to very angry skin. So I started prednisone… took first dose of 40mg at 3:30 by 8:30 the sunburn like pain on my face (especially eyelids) has almost gone away. I can’t wait to see the progress of healing after the next few doses! So happy it worked. If you get it bad try it. I feel like the few times I’ve used prednisone in the past I waited too long (ie day 5 or beyond) to call doc you get script. Lesson learned - call day one!,VaHsing
9,Prednisone,Skin Rash,2.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"May 7, 2021",20,"I’ve taken one 25mg tablet and it’s taken the redness away but insane itching and burning my feet have swollen and doubled in size and I can’t sleep and my mood has been very affected  within 24hrs of taking this tablet.I will be consulting my doctor this morning about it everything is SO ITCHY and everything’s burning.

10,Prednisone,Skin Rash,4.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"April 21, 2021",10,"I was prescribed prednisone for contact dermatitis for 6 days on a 60mg/day 1 - 10mg/day taper. It took care of the dermatitis issue while on the medication but 2-3 days after finishing the medication I developed a severe itching burning rash all over my hands, arms, chest, neck and legs. I couldn't stand it and I went to an urgent care unit and was told I was having a rebound dermatitis flare because I should have been on prednisone for 14 days. Okay.. fair.. so I take the prednisone starting at 60mg and tapering slowly for 14 days. rash comes back on my chest/neck and arms/hands after finishing the medication again but is less severe. It has been about a week and a half off prednisone and my skin is still pretty itchy but starting to clear up. Never again will I take sterioids unless I have no other option.",Ali
11,Prednisone,Skin Rash,4.0,,"November 3, 2020",19,You're all being under prescribed. I was treated by an urgent care doctor and put on a 2 week plan at 20mg a day and it did nothing. A second visit i was told to apply over the counter creams (like hydrocortisone) and take antihistamines (like benadryl). 6 months of small lingering patches later and i know have full blown severe rashes and open sores across over 50% of my body. My dermatologist laughed at my original treatment plan. I'm two days into a 60mg a day 3 week plan and it's already greatly improved. However i do have heart burn as a side affect but it's doing its job.,Focused926
12,Prednisone,Skin Rash,8.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"August 4, 2020",15,At 36 I got my first experience with poison ivy. In 2 days it went from 3-4 small patches on my arm to my entire neck then covering my entire face. The doctor gave me Prednisone oral for 3 weeks and it has given me mood swings and extreme irritability. My poison ivy is about 70% gone after 3 days of prednisone but I am mad all the time. It is worth the trade off because poison ivy is worse than my extreme case of chicken pox.,Rosie
13,Prednisone,Skin Rash,2.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"July 21, 2020",5,"I get poison ivy rash every year, go to Urgent Care. Usually from my dog as I know what it is. This year, I pulled the ivy from an area at my new house. Bathed immediately in Tecnu, tried to alleviate itching with cortizone cream and anti-itch spray. Went to urgent care after 3 days with rash, 5 days after exposure. It did not look as bad as other years, doctor gave me 16 day prednisone prescription, filled immediately. Usually I get a shot of prednisone to get me started on recovery, but not this year, it did not look very bad, but it is uncontrollable to me. Now, 3 days of 40mg, and this morning first day of 30mg dose. It is not working well! Now, 10 hours after taking the 3 pills, it is driving me crazy! Why does this not work as in the past?",Sara
14,Prednisone,Skin Rash,9.0,,"March 11, 2020",129,"I've done the Prednisone treatment for severe Poison Ivy twice in my life, around 30 years ago and right now.  In both instances the rashes and blistering were severe and my skin was screaming for relief from the itching.Both times, the Prednisone effect took up to 6 hours to become noticeable, but once that started the relief became incremental, albeit slowly, The rashes and blisters started to slowly dry after 12 hours or so, with the redness and swelling becoming noticeable less after 18 hours. Any sort of warmth on my arms (where the contact occurred) for another couple of days seemed to bring back the redness and worsen the itching, but holding them under cold tap water for a while would stop that.After the 3rd dose (72 hours) I didn't even think about the rashes and blisters nor the itching and the tough part was reminding myself to finish out the dosage.The dosage per day (mg) was: 40-40-40, 30-30-30, 20-20-20, 10-10-10 (12 days)",Tez

19,Prednisone,Skin Rash,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"August 7, 2019",76,"I had a very severe poison ivy rash that started out the size of a dime and rapidly spread within days to both my legs, calves, thighs, hands and face. No creams or ointments helped, it kept spreading and was very angry looking. It was so bad that the blisters were draining/dripping down my legs . I ended up going to the doctor and he prescribed me Prednisone . This is no lie — within MINUTES of taking this medication I could feel the itching and terrible burning finally relieve itself! Then only 6 HOURS LATER the redness surrounding the blisters was GONE! 12 hours later I took my next recommended dosage and the swelling and open sores were closed and looked nearly healed by night time. The 2nd day I had zero itching, burning or pain and the rash has dramatically healed. It’s half the size as yesterday and I have no pain at all.
