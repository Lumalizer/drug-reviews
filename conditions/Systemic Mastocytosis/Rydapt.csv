0,Rydapt,Systemic Mastocytosis,7,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"June 9, 2019",0,"I have a love/hate relationship with Rydapt which I take for aggressive systemic mastocytosis (ASM).  A year ago, we thought I had months to live.  Well, I am still here and doing much better.  I had lost 160 lbs in 6 months, my mast cells were out of control in most parts of my digestive system and bone marrow and I had  the rashâ€™s, twitching and every other ailment that goes with ASM. I started Rydapt and things improved, I gained the weight I needed to gain back and the ASM has been responding very well. HOWEVER... this drug has caused a panic in me, twice a day!   I cannot stop vomiting, it has progressively gotten worse and is now damaging my stomach.  However, I still rate this drug a  7, for all of the positive effects it has had!",Mastocytosis
