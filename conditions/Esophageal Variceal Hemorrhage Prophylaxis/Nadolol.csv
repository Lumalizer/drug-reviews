0,Nadolol,Esophageal Variceal Hemorrhage Prophylaxis,9,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"March 23, 2017",11,"I have almost bled to death due to esophageal varicies, and not only did the Nadalol make me feel stronger but every time I have dealt with the condition simply by using this miracle pill and nothing else, the bleeding quickly stopped. I'm not sure if this is just a happy coincidence, but I doubt it because the results were consistently positive.",ThankyouNadalol

3,Nadolol,Esophageal Variceal Hemorrhage Prophylaxis,8,,"April 29, 2008",33,"I have had variceal bleeding.  Feel much better when taking the nadolol.  I didn't take it at first, I took propananlol for a while but quit because I couldn't afford it. At this point the only side effect I can recall is feeling a little tired and dizzy when I first began taking it, and running out and not being on it for about 5 days; I didn't feel good.  I believe this drug is very beneficial for bleeding related to the liver.",LIVE1
