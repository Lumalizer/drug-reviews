0,Meclizine,NauseaVomiting,10,Taken for 5 to 10 years,"September 8, 2020",5,Meclizine is great but cyclizine is even better. Its OTC but I can't find it anywhere and feel like I have covered the face of earth. Only think I can think is it just isn't being made. ,NinersFan
1,Meclizine,NauseaVomiting,8,,"March 21, 2020",6,Antivert (meclizine):I have chronic mastroiditis the internet says I need antibiotics for each time I get this. I have told the drs. They won't give me antibiotics. Especially now with world's crisis. Well so far I believe that my prescription anti vertigo works with my veritgo and reaccuring infections have temporally have worked. at least with the pain. I still may have to go into to get checked for infection. So far so good .,Dragonfly 0471
2,Meclizine,NauseaVomiting,10,Taken for less than 1 month,"February 24, 2020",18,"Was prescribed meclizine for nausea/ dizziness that started due to a viral infection. It definitely helped in my experience completely stop any of the symptoms I had, only thing worth noting in my experience is that it definitely made me wanna lay down and sleep.",Milmil4248
3,Meclizine,NauseaVomiting,10,Taken for less than 1 month,"November 11, 2019",16,Bonine (meclizine):Bonine also works great for nausea that is not associated with motion sickness.,WelcomeToDetox
4,Meclizine,NauseaVomiting,8,Taken for less than 1 month,"March 8, 2019",13,"Bonine (meclizine):Although bonine does not take all of the nausea away, it takes it away enough to avoid vomiting when the stomach bug is running its course. Although not indicated for gastroenteritis (aka ""stomach flu""), I have used it on many occasions as I own a business; and any day not at work is lost income. Note- Dramamine, another motion sickness medicine, works even better in my opinion.",sfckusarmy
5,Meclizine,NauseaVomiting,10,Taken for less than 1 month,"January 6, 2019",17,"I get horrible nausea when I have migraines, the symptom ends up being worse for me than the actual head pain. I usually just tough it out but I remembered that my doctor had prescribed me meclizine when I first started having them and it worked great back then. Within a few minutes of taking this, I could breathe again! I get really bad anxiety when it comes to vomiting so my blood pressure went down too. Definitely going to be a regular in my medicine cabinet.",CaptainCoolios
6,Meclizine,NauseaVomiting,8,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"April 6, 2018",12,"I suffer from chronic stomach migraines and this drug helps me within a half hour, meaning I can move around and get things done instead of laying down and holding still just hoping it goes away. Life changer.",Anonymous
7,Meclizine,NauseaVomiting,10,,"February 25, 2016",23,Have taken meclizine for about three years to combat nausea from Tramadol 40. It has been perfect with zero side effects. Can be bought at Walgreens at 100ct for under $10.00.,Spinner1
8,Meclizine,NauseaVomiting,10,,"December 17, 2015",18,"I was having morning sickness symptoms while going through menopause. I was sick for 3 months, having every test know to man to figure out why I was nauseated 24/7. Then on a whim, my gastrologist gave me a prescription for Antivert/Meclizine. Wow, within 20 minutes the nausea had subsided. You have to continue your dosage until the nausea has passed. Sort of build up in your system. Stop too soon and the misses comes right back. Now I only use it occasionally.",Susie7usa
9,Meclizine,NauseaVomiting,9,Taken for less than 1 month,"February 4, 2013",44,"I have poor tolerance of many medicines but was given Meclizine when I became extremely ill on a cruise. It (chewable form) calmed my stomach within 1/2 an hour and gave me the best night's sleep in a long time!  Next morning, I was like a new person. I used it again after gall bladder surgery when other medicines (Zofran, Compazine) produced horrible side effects, & again just last week when I had stomach ""flu""...the doctor was skeptical and wrote a script for Zofran anyway, but the meclizine worked SO much better for quelling the nausea. I generally think that drugs do more harm than good but when you're lying on the floor unable to keep down food or water & something (meclizine) relieves that, it's like a miracle.",GibbyGirl
10,Meclizine,NauseaVomiting,10,,"April 17, 2012",34,Bonine (meclizine):A friend of mine told me to take Bonine because I have horrible morning sickness. I'm pregnant with my third child and it's an awful thing to have to chase after two kids with morning sickness! It worked wonders for me. I would tell everyone to at least try it!,Anonymous
11,Meclizine,NauseaVomiting,10,,"February 23, 2012",44,"Antivert (meclizine):I have used Antivert for seasickness and it may be the only thing I've used that really works.  The over the counter medications for car sickness did not work for me.  Also the medicated pad you wear behind the ear (scopolamine, I think) litterly puts me out for hours -- maybe you could cut a small piece.  Antivert also makes me sleepy, but less than the others.  My friend has vertigo and uses it for that with success.  It has to be prescribed, however.",Anonymous
12,Meclizine,NauseaVomiting,6,,"September 23, 2009",14,Didn't take my nausea away completely but it did not make me sleepy.,Anonymous
13,Meclizine,NauseaVomiting,8,,"September 29, 2008",45,"Bonine (meclizine):I had nausea, vomiting and dizziness due to withdrawls from medicines.  Taking Bonine has helped me get through the day.",Anonymous
