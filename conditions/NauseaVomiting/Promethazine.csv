1,Promethazine,NauseaVomiting,8.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"March 2, 2022",0,"I have taken 25mg promethazine for a few years now, I don’t take it every night, but the nights I have it are a godsend. I have gastroparesis and so I'm nauseous all the time. I also have bad insomnia and usually bad stomach flares during the night, and this saves it. The only downside to this med is that you will wake up VERY tired usually and maybe dry mouth. It takes a bit to fully wake up. Also, after I take it, I notice myself being lowkey grumpy and irritable. but, I guess it’s better than nausea, insomnia, and throwing up! I will take it!",vanilla

My mother was given this in the hospital for mild nauseous feeling.  I think they thought she would be sedated by it.  She is elderly.

I’m pregnant and my doctor didn’t want to give me zofran yet so she gave me phenergan… but all it does is make me pass out asleep, which isn’t helpful at ALL since I have a young baby already, or I throw up ANYWAY because if I don’t take it with food/I take it before I feel bad it turns my stomach. If I wake up already vomiting stomach acid, I can’t take food or the medication and it’s just useless to me. I noticed a lot of the positive reviews mention anxiety, I suppose it mostly helped them because of the sedative effects?

None of the other nausea meds were working they even gave me suppositories. I was admitted to the hospital and I ended up on an IV drip of zofran for a couple of days to give me some relief. Once they took me off the drip I was scheduled to get the zofran regularly. One particular nurse was terrible about giving me my medication on time and I got so sick they had to look for an alternative. She gave me Phenergan which made me drowsy uncoordinated, disoriented and gave me restless leg for a while. That experience was terrifying.When the doctors came in to check on me they told me that I was given too big of a dose so they were going to try it again at half a dose. That half dose was AMAZING!!! It took away the nausea immediately and allowed me to sleep comfortably. That became my regular nausea med for the rest of the hyperemesis and I was given a prescription to use at home as needed.

It was the most frightening medical experience I have ever had. I just kept my mouth shut and didn’t tell anyone what what happening to me because I didn’t want to be given any more medicine.

I was a little apprehensive to take it because taking any medication while pregnant can be risky I feel. Anyway my nausea was so bad one day I decided to take one and it totally wiped me out. I was exhausted, and could have slept forever. At first I didn't want to take it again, but the next day I noticed my anxiety was calmer. I have severe PTSD and anxiety and upon finding out I was pregnant I stopped taking my meds for it (klonopin). They aren't safe, but I had been miserable since stopping. I just lived in complete panic/fear. I realized when I take just 1/4 of the promethazine tab my doc prescribed me for nausea my panic attack subsides and I can function a bit more normally. I only do this when I absolutely need it, but its a relief to me knowing that if I do panic I can at least take something to calm me down that my doctor approves of and is said to be safe for pregnant women.",barney071114

15,Promethazine,NauseaVomiting,9.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"April 11, 2021",9,I went to the ER with severe nausea and anxiety. Usually IV zofran works when I have a bout but not this time. So the doctor tried compazine which did not work either.  I was then admitted that evening and one of the residents felt that I should be given 25 mg of promethazine. It took away the nausea completely and I was able to sleep. They sent me home the next day with a prescription but I found that taking a whole 25mg pill knocked me out and I was groggy the whole day. I tried taking half but was still groggy. So now when I get nauseous I take only a quarter and it takes away the nausea without that zombie feeling.,Dee

I was even given it as a child, back in the 80’s, to help me sleep as a result of my ADHD. Unfortunately, the colouring on it (blue), gives me chronic heartburn, within minutes of taking it. This in turn makes the Nausea even worse. Most of my nausea is anxiety induced. I took one, an hour ago, and because of the colour of the pill, it induced a massive wave of heartburn and nausea and I was just sick on myself, within minutes of taking it.

The pandemic made my episodes more frequent so I went to my doctor. Zofran had no effect on me so they prescribed this pill. It totally cures the nausea. I do get a bit drowsy but since I take it when I’m hyped on adrenaline anyway it’s usually a relief. I only need 1/4 of a pill, which I take an hour or so before eating or if I feel like a panic attack is coming on. I gave it 9 just because it doesn’t help if I take it right when I feel like I’m going to throw up, you need to take it preemptively.

28,Promethazine,NauseaVomiting,9.0,Taken for 5 to 10 years,"May 4, 2020",21,"For decades, I've dealt with nausea (with & without vomiting). At times it resembles motion sickness, occurring as a passenger in certain vehicles, but most commonly I simply experience an onset of nausea. It dates back to early childhood (now age 39). Two meds effectively treat it for me: ondansetron (Zofran) & promethazine (Phenergan). I opt for promethazine due to price & versatility. If I sense the onset of nausea, I take just 6.25mg (thanks to bi-scored tablets) & proactively treat it. Likewise, if I'm nauseated to the point of being unable to function, I can take 12.5, 18.75 or 25mg- depending on circumstance. I have no significant side effects. It can cause drowsiness (in me) but only sedates if I lie down to sleep. I've taken 25mg many times & gone about my day. I also find it helpful for certain allergies. Its versatile & I love that I can tailor the dose precisely & depend on it. I've been prescribed for a decade, though only find it necessary 5-7 times a month, on average.",atypicalzacko
