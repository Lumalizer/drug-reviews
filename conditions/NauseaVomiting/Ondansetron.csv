0,Ondansetron,NauseaVomiting,10.0,Taken for 5 to 10 years,"March 17, 2022",0,"Zofran has been a lifesaver for me! My multiple chronic illnesses have forced me to have to take a strong antibiotic every single day (2x a day) in order to somewhat manage my constant severe sinus infections (3 sinus surgeries in one year didn't even make a dent in the infections); the antibiotic has kept me from frequent hospital stays when it got so bad it traveled into my lungs. But that strong med comes with strong nausea and vomiting, so they put me on Zofran & it almost instantly stopped it. I've been on Zofran 2x a day, EVERY day for almost 10 years & it's made all the difference in the world for me. I actually take both the pill (to take with my antibiotic) as well as the disintegrating tablet for those times it comes on super quick. I have the 8mg pills, which I split in half, because there's times 4mg are enough and times when I need the 8mg. I'm so sorry for those who haven't had relief from this med and hope they're able to find something that does.",Rightmama

Zofran is the only thing that will stop it. It makes me a little tired, but I’ll take that any day over the nausea.

When I feel the nausea starting, I put 2 tablets under my tongue followed by a Chewy Tum and a Prilosec ODT.  I was given Promethazine before Zofran was available to me which worked fantastic cuz it puts you to sleep and you sleep thru the nausea episode which is not practical when you are working. Zofran saved me by allowing me to recover from nausea episodes taking 30 minutes out of my day vs 1/2 or entire day off work. Great drug!!!",Renee

My daughter also was prescribed zofran during a time that she was nauseous. I did not tell her initially of my prior experience taking zofran, because I realized medicines have different effects on different people.Of course, I was hoping it would help her & my daughter would feel better immediately or soon after taking it.

It has always worked beautifully in combatting those days when I or a friend have felt nauseated. But the last time I took one , in February, during the night when awakened by stomach pain and nausea, it actually made things worse by adding an immediate head ache, and extreme heart palpitations..that lasted a good half hour, with out helping my initial nausea at all. I’ve been afraid to use it ever since.  Turns out I was experiencing a gallbladder attack, and I’m not certain that wasn’t the reason the Zofran failed.  Today, I’m having one of those icky nauseated days, two doses of Emetrol have not helped, so I took a Zofran and cut it in half, yes, they are already small, but I was nervous.

At first I noticed it made me a little dizzy and it still makes me feel just a little weird within the first hour but it’s extremely tolerable. The constipation is super annoying but talk to your doctor about it if that’s an issue and you can probably take something to help that. It stops me from throwing up but I am still definitely nauseous. Brings it from like a 10 to a 5 or 6 maybe but I can EAT now. That is huge. I am eating small meals when I haven’t had a meal in weeks. I’ve been barely eating and drinking. I am completely dependent on zofran to be any type of functional right now.

After 3 surgeries and multiple nausea filled days due to a chronic health condition, I’ve concluded that this drug makes things worse for me. I kept hoping it was all in my head, but other anti nausea meds (and even peppermint) work almost immediately, at least to a certain extent. Whereas this always makes me 10x worse to the point of vomiting. It also gives me really bad headaches and I don’t ever get headaches in general. It’s the only medication that gives me this side effect. So I think this either works very well for people, or makes it worse. I’m wondering if it has to do with brain chemistry since it’s a serotonin blocker? I’m severely ADHD with mild OCD and depression. Perhaps certain brain wiring just doesn’t benefit. I’d love more research to be done on this since it’s the standard anti nausea treatment given in hospitals.",Pickled
