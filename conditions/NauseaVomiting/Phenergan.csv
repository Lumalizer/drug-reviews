0,Phenergan,NauseaVomiting,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"February 28, 2022",0,Do not use this medication for anyone over 60.  My mother was given this in the hospital for mild nauseous feeling.  I think they thought she would be sedated by it.  She is elderly.  This drug put her into a terrible state of hallucinations delirium and all around restlessness for about 8 hours.  It’s awful.   She would have been better off with tums.  Be aware of all the side affects.,A t g

I had to go to the ER and I was on Zophren which helped during the day but at night my morning sickness Aka HG ravaged.

3,Phenergan,NauseaVomiting,10.0,,"July 11, 2021",2,"Second trimester of pregnancy and had lost 30 lbs due to hyperemesis. None of the other nausea meds were working they even gave me suppositories. I was admitted to the hospital and I ended up on an IV drip of zofran for a couple of days to give me some relief. Once they took me off the drip I was scheduled to get the zofran regularly. One particular nurse was terrible about giving me my medication on time and I got so sick they had to look for an alternative. She gave me Phenergan which made me drowsy uncoordinated, disoriented and gave me restless leg for a while. That experience was terrifying.When the doctors came in to check on me they told me that I was given too big of a dose so they were going to try it again at half a dose. That half dose was AMAZING!!! It took away the nausea immediately and allowed me to sleep comfortably. That became my regular nausea med for the rest of the hyperemesis and I was given a prescription to use at home as needed. It saved my life.",Jules
4,Phenergan,NauseaVomiting,1.0,,"June 10, 2021",4,"I was given phenergan in the hospital when zofran wasn’t doing enough for my nausea due to food poisoning. They put a large amount into my IV and a few minutes later I realized I couldn’t tell if I was dreaming or awake. I keep staring at my husband wondering if he was really there or not (he was) . It was the most frightening medical experience I have ever had. I just kept my mouth shut and didn’t tell anyone what what happening to me because I didn’t want to be given any more medicine. It did get rid of my nausea though, but not even close to being worth it...so terribly frightening.",suzanneshena
5,Phenergan,NauseaVomiting,9.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"October 27, 2020",57,"I have panic disorder, so when stressed out I get very nauseous and frequently throw up. The pandemic made my episodes more frequent so I went to my doctor. Zofran had no effect on me so they prescribed this pill. It totally cures the nausea. I do get a bit drowsy but since I take it when I’m hyped on adrenaline anyway it’s usually a relief. I only need 1/4 of a pill, which I take an hour or so before eating or if I feel like a panic attack is coming on. I gave it 9 just because it doesn’t help if I take it right when I feel like I’m going to throw up, you need to take it preemptively. But despite this I would recommend this to anyone who gets nauseous due to anxiety! I love that it has no side effects and it has helped so much in my recovery.",Anxiousgirl
6,Phenergan,NauseaVomiting,9.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"September 8, 2020",33,"I have Cyclic Vomiting Syndrome. Believe me, I tried EVERYTHING for my nausea. Zofran, Omeprazole, Dramamine, etc. You name it, I've tried it. Nothing could stop my violent vomiting episodes. Phenergan suppositories are the only thing that could ever put a stop to my nausea and vomiting. The only problem is, it makes me very very tired, so I can hardly function in classes if I have to take it during the day. But I'll take being a little ""out of it"" over being so sick any day!",June

9,Phenergan,NauseaVomiting,9.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"December 21, 2019",19,"Had an outpatient procedure and put into a twilight sedation, with additional pain meds through the IV although I can’t recall what that was. The pain meds caused me terrible nausea, and dizziness. I was given a dose of Zofran and a motion sickness patch before surgery to try and prevent this as I get nauseous from pain meds so easily...that didn’t work. I was given 12.5 mg of phenergran and 15 minutes later symptoms had improved greatly. I was able to get dressed and start on my way home, although the nausea was still present somewhat due to the motion of the car ride home. Hit the bed and slept like a rock for four hours, felt sleepy the rest of the evening. Blood pressure did go up some as well, 132/88. Took my usual Beta blocker at bedtime that helped my bp come down.",Woozy

I am on 25mg for a few days and feel that it has helped with the nausea a little bit with the anxiety but it has made me sleep all day and feel sad. I normally have trouble getting onto strong meds such as anti depressants but I don't know if this is a case of this or something else.  I am scared of becoming depressed.,Yanks950

I have tried Zofran and a couple of other medications for this but none are as effective as Phenergan. Whether orally or I.V., it takes away the nausea. I have a GJ tube for enteral nutrition. Vomiting can cause the tube to twist and slide out of place so it's imperative to keep it under control. Phenergan does that for me. It also helps with the side effects from the painkillers I must take every day (oxycodone and Dilaudid). I don't know where I would be without it.

It has been over three years and I am yet to get a diagnosis. I am grateful for this medicine. It is the only thing that stops the nausea. I would be crazy without this medicine! I was given Phenergan in the ER after I had a bad reaction to Zofran. It worked so well I asked the Doctor to send me home with a prescription for it.  At my last ER visit they told me they were out of Phenergan and that it was in short supply. I was given Bentyl instead. That also gave me a bad reaction.
