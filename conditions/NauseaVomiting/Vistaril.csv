0,Vistaril,NauseaVomiting,10,Taken for less than 1 month,"September 26, 2019",22,"I started getting extremely sick and nauseous (about 5 weeks ago) to the point that I had to go to the ER. IV zofran didn’t do anything for me. They gave me  IV fluid  since I was so dehydrated, then I went home, still extremely nauseous. I remember my mom telling me that she used vistril for morning sickness while she was pregnant with my brothers (do male babies make people more nauseous??). I take vistril for my anxiety so I have it on my 24/7. I pulled over and took 100mg (I was desperate. I normally took 50mg). By the time I got home from the ER I was able to breathe without feeling nauseous. Sadly after 5 weeks of taking it, it’s stopped working as well but it still works. Hopefully it won’t fully stop working because I’m still nauseous if I don’t take it.",lmm
1,Vistaril,NauseaVomiting,9,Taken for less than 1 month,"November 10, 2012",90,"I suffer from anxiety and I've tried a lot of medicines that just destroyed my stomach. I also have a ""sensitive"" stomach. Along with a phobia of vomiting. So add that up and stir in insomnia, makes for a very unhappy me. Vistaril has helped with the nervous stomach aches, the anxiety induced vomiting, and my anxiety while helping my Lunesta be more effective. This medicine is awesome.",Emetophobic
