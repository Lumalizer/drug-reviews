0,Scopolamine,NauseaVomiting,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"January 21, 2022",0,"Never again!! They put the patch behind my left ear prior to hysterectomy and 5 weeks later my left eye still has double vision and ptosis (droopy eyelid). Ophthalmologist says I got a massive dose of it into my eye through my blood stream. He had never seen it last so long and impact such deep muscles. It paralyzes your eye muscles!!! When I left the hospital, my left eye was completely closed and stayed that way for over a week. Oh and I vomited on the way out, too. So angry!",Nope
1,Scopolamine,NauseaVomiting,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"January 5, 2022",0,"My doctor had me place this behind my ear the night before surgery. When I woke up the next morning before surgery, I was so dizzy I nearly fell over twice and I had a terribly dry mouth and sore throat. I had bad anxiety all morning (not from the surgery, I’ve had surgery before and never felt like this) and I started to get shaky, agitated and feel sick. I asked the anesthesiologist if I could take it off and he said yes. Within 30 minutes I felt much better and the nurses even commented on how calm/better I seemed. He said I probably should avoid that class of medication in the future.",Bad Side Effect
2,Scopolamine,NauseaVomiting,1.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"December 28, 2021",0,"So I was actually prescribed this by my OB because I was so sick during my first trimester of pregnancy. Whew- I wish I could go back in time and not get this prescription filled. I should have known from the start, honestly. I woke up the next day after putting it on and I could not see a thing up close!! Like literally I could not read the texts on my phone. I had to borrow my friend’s reading glasses. Anyways…. At the time I told myself that this was better than throwing up all day, because it DID help with that. Flash-forward a few weeks later, I decided that I was feeling a bit better and that it was a good time to remove the patch. Well the next day I found myself puking more than I had in weeks. I got online to read these review and thought, it must be the patch! I put on one and within an hour I felt better. This scared me. I ended up getting my body to wean off of it by cutting it smaller and smaller each time I replaced it. It worked!",Jaxsmom

4,Scopolamine,NauseaVomiting,1.0,,"July 18, 2021",0,"I put this patch on before I went to bed last night. What mistake! I woke up and felt drunk. I have blurry vision, nausea, dizziness land dilated pupils. I wore it less than 8 hours. I am on vacation and was supposed to go snorkeling but I am not sure I am going to be able to go. I wish I had put it on during the day so I would have known this was occurring without wearing it so long. I strongly believe this drug should never be used. Awful.",Anonymous
5,Scopolamine,NauseaVomiting,1.0,,"June 23, 2021",1,"Please do your homework on this before using. This patch was placed behind my left ear prior to my procedure to help with Post-Op Nausea. The only side effect I was warned of was dilated pupils and double vision. After my outpatient procedure I had no nausea. The following day I experienced extreme blurred vision and dry mouth. After 45 hours with the patch on, I removed it. That was 5 days ago. I am still nauseous and fighting vertigo and imbalance. The day after I removed this patch I experienced what felt like a bad acid trip... I was also insanely sick, experienced vertigo (which I have never had in my life), and unable to eat for days. My insides hurt as if I had a virus (like someone is twisting your intestines). Day 5 of removing the patch and day 7 post-op, I am still experiencing nausea with no signs of it letting up. I am wondering if maybe the dosage in the patch was just too much for me. So please do your homework before using. I would have rather dealt with the post-op nausea than this.",mmwolfe
6,Scopolamine,NauseaVomiting,1.0,,"March 6, 2021",3,"I've had a horrible experience with this patch. I had a minor back surgery and the  patch was placed behind my left ear, but no instructions given. The day after surgery I tried to go for a walk, but when I stepped outside everything became extremely bright and discolored, and was disoriented. I noticed one dilated pupil. I took the patch off after having it on for 32 hours. The next day I felt incredibly weak, tired, dizzy, lightheaded, blurry vision,  anxious, nervous, and a headache. I ended up going to the ER when the symptoms continued. They seemed to be clueless to all these side effects from the patch. It's day three now and I'm still having issues. I tried to take a quick walk, didn't even go a block and I felt like my legs were going to give out, and like I was going to have a panic attack. The last thing I need after back surgery is being dizzy and off balance. This medicine is dangerous. I can't believe doctors aren't more up to speed about the debilitating side effects.",Anonymous

I fared well after I came out of recovery and felt pretty good the first couple of days. The Doctor ad tovised leave the patch on for 3 days.  Holy cow immediately after the patch came off I felt like I just got off of a carnival ride.  I am a week out from surgery and I am dizzy, nauseous, agitated, weak, runny nose, body aches I feel worse than I did when I had COVID.  I wish the Doctor would have warned me about side effects.    I will not use this patch again.",Annie
8,Scopolamine,NauseaVomiting,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"December 18, 2020",2,This medication was prescribed to me for anti-nausea. It was the worst experience of my life.

Vision problems continued even after I stopped using this medication to the point where I had to get glasses and to this day seems to be progressing. Do not recommend.,Kinnon
9,Scopolamine,NauseaVomiting,5.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"November 27, 2020",1,I've used Scopolamine patches in the past for post op nausea & vomiting. I had 21 kidney stones about a month ago and had surgery to remove them. This has helped tremendously when I can't keep oral meds down. It also helps lessen my nausea caused by Gastroparesis. Only downside is dry mouth.,Anonymous
10,Scopolamine,NauseaVomiting,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"October 5, 2020",7,"Do not take scopolamine! It’s feels like it is poisoning my body. I was given the trans dermal patch during an ER visit for un-retractable Ménière’s Disease vertigo and vomiting. I had never heard of the med before. The doctor said it was a safe option that worked fast. It stopped my vomiting instantly along with making me so drowsy I couldn’t stand and had to be wheeled to the car. I slept for 48 hours straight, while just having the energy to make it to the bathroom. I removed the patch after 48 hours and proceeded to get dry heaves, a horrible rash on my hands and feet (like I had been burned.) Anxiety, hallucinations, insomnia, eye pain, dizziness, body aches and muscle spasms. Still in bed suffering. I can’t imagine what would have happened if I left the patch on for the additional allotted day.",Gigi
11,Scopolamine,NauseaVomiting,1.0,,"June 12, 2020",14,"I was on scopolamine while in the hospital for gastritis from post gallbladder surgery and blood clot from pregnancy.  At first I noticed my throat swelling and extreme dry mouth. I told the doctor and he didn't seem worried. Then I noticed that I was getting very agitated and nervous. When I left the hospital, I was shaking like crazy. My heart would race all the time. I went to the ER, and they gave me drugs for anxiety and sent me home, but all they did was make me sleep. I would wake up the next morning with tremors. I finally had a major panic attack and started thinking people were out to get me. I was diagnosed with all the symptoms of extreme hyperthyroidism, but my thyroid was fine. I got to an internal medicine doctor, and he took me off the patch. My inflammation went down but I came off the drug hard. My eyes dilated , and I had blurry vision for several days. I then started crying and physically crashed. It is going to take time to recover mentally what this patch did to me.",Survivor
12,Scopolamine,NauseaVomiting,1.0,,"March 23, 2020",5,"A week ago I had gallbladder surgery. My 1st surgery in 66 years. I didn't want to wake up sick, so my surgeon suggested scopolamine patch. I also took emend and zofran in the IV. I read horror stories before the surgery and after. Thank God I felt perfectly fine when I awoke and days later. I wore the patch for 68 hrs. On the 2nd day, Tues, I could hardly pee and it burned. This went away by Wed. afternoon. The morning the patch was removed, I had warm tingling under the skin of my right arm, blurred vision that came on Tues night, left by Thurs, back on Friday afternoon, by Friday night it was gone again. I had a 'less common' side effect from Mon night till last night which was the entire bottom of my left foot (same side as the patch) was numb, felt like neuropathy. This was gone late last night, Saturday. From Tues till Thurs I was a little lightheaded and wasn't walking too good, along with confusion,",katlady

When I woke up from surgery I experienced double vision in the middle and far distance range, and completely blurred vision in the near distance.  I was unable to make out words up close, despite the fact that I've always had 20/20 vision or better.  I was told that the effects would wear off in a few days, and my vision did improve somewhat, but never back to 100%.  It has been about two months and I now have to wear reading glasses, probably permanently.  I would caution anyone against taking this drug.  I certainly would have preferred a few days of nausea and vomiting over having to wear glasses for the rest of my life.",JLinn
15,Scopolamine,NauseaVomiting,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"January 11, 2020",2,"This was put on by my anesthesiologist during  surgery to help with post operative nausea/vomiting. When I finally woke up, almost a day after I was out of surgery I was so sleepy and dizzy I couldn’t stand it. I had had the patch on less than 24 hours at this point. The nurse took the patch off and within 2 hours or so I was at least a little more coherent. It felt like I was rocking on a boat while sitting in my hospital bed.

16,Scopolamine,NauseaVomiting,2.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"January 5, 2020",3,I was given this patch after telling my doctor that many medications make me nausea and I was worried about waking up from procedure feeling sick.  They put the patch on me and soon after I was wheeled into surgery. As soon as I woke up I vomited a few times.  This possibly could have been prevented if given the patch earlier that right before surgery.   I was told I could keep the patch on for 3 days.  I took it off after 72 hours of having it on and within an hour I was a complete mess.  I could barely walk and felt extremely sick.   It felt as though I overdosed.  It was a very scary experience.  I came to discover that this medicine has a syndrome connected to it.  After being frightened for several hours I did some research online. I started taking Zoloft to combat the effects of the last medicine. I felt better 24 hours later.,Anonymous

I never had any issues with nausea and vomiting, not right after surgery, or the next several days afterwards either. I didn't have any side affects while wearing the patch or once I took it off either.   It worked wonderfully!  The nurse who gave me my discharge instructions said I can leave the patch on for 3 days, and also told me to be extremely careful when removing it.  She told me to try to be super careful when peeling the patch off, and do NOT touch your eyes until you can wash your hands really well TWICE.  And, to also wrap the patch in a Kleenex or napkin then shove it way down deep into the garbage can.  She said if the medication gets into the eyes it'll dilate them and cause blurriness for 2-3 days.  I took her instructions to heart and followed them closely.",KDW

I got this patch put behind my ear before surgery and it helped my nausea and vomiting upon waking up from anesthesia. After I had taken it off 72 hours later, my pupils were extremely dilated and I could not see at all since my vision was so blurry. The vertigo sensation is terrible as it feels like I’m rocking back and forth on a boat. The nausea is terrible now too! I wasn’t told of any of these side effects and would have never had this put on if I knew! I told my doctor about it a day after removing the first patch (because I didn’t know my symptoms were from withdrawal) and he prescribed ANOTHER patch for me to take! Out of confusion on what was wrong with me and being so sick from my symptoms, I wore another patch for another 3 days! My lesson is being learned the hard way. Hoping I’ll get better and back to normal sooner than later. All of these terrible withdraw symptoms are NOT worth wearing that patch! Never again!!",Rose

The anesthesiologist put one behind my ear right before wheeling me off into surgery. I finally took it off 2 days later. I haven’t been able to see because my pupils are so dilated. I had trouble walking around without losing my balance. This patch also slows your digestive system making it difficult to absorb pain meds. It certainly did for me! I have been in agony since my surgery wondering why I got zero relief from my pain meds. Now I know why. I wouldn’t touch this or recommend anyone else to either.,SSDGM

During those three days I experienced neck pain and a very bad headache  for the three days. So on the third day I mentioned the bad headache to my daughter and she asked if I was still wearing the patch. I said I was and she mentioned that was probably the cause of my headache. I rarely get a headache. After researching a little I found this was a side effect. My headache has lessened a lot, but not completely better. You really do have to do your own research on everything. Not happy at all that I was told to keep this on 3 days. TOTALLY UNNECESSARY",Kati

She told me to leave it on for three days and that there is typically no side effects, just some slight dizziness. After surgery, I had no nausea. I removed the patch after the second day because I had read about possible withdrawal symptoms and didn't want to get them. Sure enough after about 9 hours, I woke up in the middle of the night nauseous and dry heaving.  Other side effects I had was extreme dry mouth, blurred vision, and hallucinations. Nausea lasted for several days and I took Dramamine and zofran to try and fight it. It wasn't worth the benefit in my opinion.",Lynnzzz

33,Scopolamine,NauseaVomiting,2.0,,"June 2, 2017",6,Had surgery and they had me put this on to minimize secretions and for nausea. It worked amazing while it was on as I was taking pain meds and went under general anesthesia. I was suffering from very bad vision though and it was quite alarming how I couldn't even read simple things. The day I took it off I threw up multiple times and had EXTREME nausea and dizziness. For two days straight I slept all day and night because it was too miserable to be awake. It took a good three or more days for me to not feel nauseous anymore. My mom also experienced a similar rebound effect. It works good for while you're on it but be careful because some people get these adverse effects like me!,Filegedhiel

I found myself focusing like an old woman who holds her reading material way out in front of her. At first I blamed it on my pain meds. But even when those would wear off I still had blurred vision.

They try several drugs ,15 more people enter the room, the cardiologist and his team are called down, and the crash cart is paged to my recovery room. They JUST managed to find a drug that took my heart down to 120-135 beats seconds before they were going to administer the paddles. Several hours later in the hospital room (I had to stay) I managed to connect the dots and talked to the anesthesiologist. I take off the patch and within 5-10 min my heart went down from a stable minimum of 120 beats to 85.

The patch did work well, I felt minorly disoriented the first few hours of having it on, and on my flight I still felt a little nauseous but not nearly as bad as it usually is with dramamine. I surprisingly did not vomit the entire 6 hours of flying I experienced. During the flight and after, my vision was blurred for a while but I would rather have blurry vision than nausea from an airplane. I would definitely recommend his product to people who are sensitive to motion and get sick easily.",Anxious Traveller 622

I was very careful and followed the instructions  making sure to wash my hands before and after placing the patch behind my ear. Only to wake up 10 hours later feeling so dizzy and nauseous. Worst of all was my vision. When I arrived at the hospital My vision was so blurry I couldn't even read the paperwork I was signing, couldn't see the time on my cell phone or read any messages. My pupils were very dialated, this lasted for 2 days. I'm on day 3 and my vision is back to normal, but upon doing to much I'm still dizzy and nauseous. I always read thoroughly before I take anything. So I know I did NOT get this in my eyes by not doing as directed. Scary stuff!!",Mz Angie Hill 1

At first I had blurred vision and after removing the patch off when the cruise was done, things went horrible. I had nausea, dizziness. Went to doctor and was told I had vertigo, and couldn't get back to work. I had to suffer because of the side effects of this patch. Not sure how FDA approved this, this is a dangerous drug and should NEVER be prescribed.",Deeps1

I woke up in the middle of the night with my neck and the left side of my face swollen. When I pulled the patch off I started throwing up. I now get motion sickness in the car.   It's a week later and my neck is still swollen and I still have motion sickness ( which  I never had before). Its very painful. I should have taken the patch off sooner. I am 5-2"" and 130lbs. It might have been too strong.",Surgery patient

She gave me this patch behind my ear, and I didn't feel one bit of nausea after the surgery.

50,Scopolamine,NauseaVomiting,7.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"December 11, 2014",7,"I have had the scopolamine patch a few times now, but I was given them to control the nausea/vomiting after surgery. First time I had it was Jan 2014 when I had surgery. I took off the patch 3 days later and I ended up in the hospital for uncontrollable vomiting about 24hrs after the patch came off. However me nor the Drs connected it to the patch. November 2014 I had to have emergency surgery. I was given the patch again, 3 days later I took off the patch 48hrs later I was in the ER and admitted that night for uncontrollable nausea/vomiting. Saturday night they put the patch back. I took the patch off Wednesday, now I'm waiting to see what happens. Noticeable side effect, dilated pupils and blurry vision. Huge problem for me.",OmahaGirl

It is worn on a patch behind the ear and changed every three days.  After 2 weeks I suddenly became allergic, probably from a build-up, and broke out in huge welts where the patch was placed.
