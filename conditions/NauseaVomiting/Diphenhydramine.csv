3,Diphenhydramine,NauseaVomiting,10.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"June 1, 2020",1,The diphenhydramine works for me when I have nausea and headaches. The only side effects I experience are sleepiness and dry mouth but I have insomnia so it's actually a big bonus drug for me and they are cheap. A bottle of Great Value is 4 bucks for 100 pills.,Rem

I remembered that diphenhydramine can also be used for nausea relief. So I took a liquid gel (50 mg) And it’s been maybe 10-15 minutes and I already feel better.  THANKS AGAIN DIPHENHYDRAMINE !!",Melangus
6,Diphenhydramine,NauseaVomiting,8.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"June 27, 2019",1,"My review is about the IV and IM form of diphenhydramine (for migraines)1. Works great for migraines and helps other drugs work better.2. Can cause anxiety & restlessness. this has to do with how quickly your body processes the drug.3. You will build up a tolerance quickly, so do not take this everyday. 4. If receiving this through an IV, ask them to push it slowly. It can burn, and it also makes me cough.",Bear
7,Diphenhydramine,NauseaVomiting,9.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"June 7, 2019",9,"Have nausea often, especially if I under eat one day, I'll be nauseous and have trouble eating for days on end. I've been given zofran, phenergan, and bentyl at ER. When those ran out and the nausea didn't, I looked on the web and saw Benadryl recommended. It's worked very well for me every time! You will most likely be pretty sleepy though. Plan on some nap time.",Sickly boi
8,Diphenhydramine,NauseaVomiting,10.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"December 18, 2018",5,"For me, this is the most reliable medication for nausea and vomiting for multiple purposes, and I’ve tried everything else including ondanzetron. For any kind of nausea taking this early enough stops vomiting altogether, and really helps for nausea side effects from other medication like morphine etc. Great as well for migraines as it reduces nausea, stops vomiting and seems to help with making other medication more effective too. I tried everything for motion sickness both natural and pharmaceutical and this is the only one that helps at all. Shame many pharmacists in the UK are so poorly informed about this medication and refuse to allow you to buy it if you say it’s for nausea- so always just say you want it for occasion sleep issues ",Beth
9,Diphenhydramine,NauseaVomiting,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"August 7, 2018",23,"Benadryl (diphenhydramine):I took a single pill of Benadryl and it made me vomit, nauseous, diarrhea, dry throat, and gave me a stuffy nose. I wouldn't give this to my worst enemy.",Amy
10,Diphenhydramine,NauseaVomiting,10.0,Taken for 5 to 10 years,"May 19, 2018",10,"Diphenhydramine has saved my life. I have a severe migraine disorder that comes with extreme nausea and sudden vomiting. I now take LIQUID Diphenhydramine, sold as Children's med, for nausea and vomiting. I tried pills and they are not fast acting enough and the dose is too high, so it makes me very sleepy. The smaller liquid dose knocks my nausea out almost immediately and only makes me mildly sleepy. I carry this med on hand at all times and take it as needed when I feel the first sign of nausea. If I feel like a full migraine is coming on, I'll take the complete adult dose. The reduction in nausea, in addition to the powerful sleepiness, can really help me avoid more expensive or risky migraine abortive medications. I've taken this medication for years and the only chronic side effect that I've noticed is dryness/dehydration, but I compensate for that with added water and fish oil. Thank you scientists for diphenhydramine!!",Migraneur

(Chewable form) My children have struggled with nausea with no help from any medication until this was brought to my attention. This is the absolute only thing I will use for nausea/vomiting.,Michelle
13,Diphenhydramine,NauseaVomiting,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"December 27, 2017",10,Was told by pediatrician to give to 4 year old for nausea and vomiting for a virus. I tried peptobismal but vomited it back up within 10 minutes.  Ondanestron was prescribed to the entire sick family. My son and I tried our odanestron and still felt nauseated. After 4 hours it was clear we needed to try something else. The Benadryl is definitely helping.,Babyslowsky
14,Diphenhydramine,NauseaVomiting,3.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"September 14, 2017",16,"Benadryl (diphenhydramine):ER gave me 25mg diphenhydramine IV for nausea.  The only effect was delirium and a brief medication nap.  I felt woozy and poisoned for at least two hours afterwards.  It may work for others, but it certainly didn't help me.",Simon Charles

16,Diphenhydramine,NauseaVomiting,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"February 22, 2017",2,"I took diphenhydramine by mouth for spring allergies. It made me drowsy and helped my allergies, but also made me dizzy and nauseated, which it is supposed to prevent. I do know that it is probably one of the best antihistamines on the market.",Mitch1951
17,Diphenhydramine,NauseaVomiting,9.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"February 21, 2017",3,"If you got a migraine cocktail in ER, then the med that gave you the anxiety, was most likely the compazine, it makes you feel very anxious that's why they give the benadryl with it to counteract the side effect of anxiety. (migraine cocktail consists of benadryl, compazine and depakote or Solumedrol). I had to take more benadryl to get rid of the severe anxiety",sylviasylvia2
18,Diphenhydramine,NauseaVomiting,,Taken for less than 1 month,"January 1, 2017",9,"Like others here, I discovered using diphenhydramine for nausea when I had to take pain killers in the hospital. My nurse explained why to me. But since, I have found that if a drug of any kind gives you nausea, or in fact if you have nausea at all, give it a try. Last week, I had a fit of nausea that I can't track to any new Rx, it just seemed to occur on its own. I took the OTC diphenhydramine and it went away.When I went to my doctor complaining of a stomach virus last year, I was prescribed Dexilant. When I had the nausea symptoms recently, I took some of the leftovers. Those didn't do anything, but the diphenhydramine worked.",Maggie Lou

20,Diphenhydramine,NauseaVomiting,10.0,,"June 5, 2016",43,Benadryl (diphenhydramine):I had a couple surgeries on my jaw where I could not open it fully for an extended period of time. I am already semi-allergic to pain meds / anesthesia (excessive vomiting and nausea) so I was terrified to take my pain killers after surgery. The nurse / doctor recommended taking a couple Benadryl tablets (25mg) before the pain meds and it worked wonders! The only side effect is drowsiness.,MarD24
21,Diphenhydramine,NauseaVomiting,10.0,,"December 29, 2015",75,Benadryl (diphenhydramine):I get severe migraines and was given this in the hospital instead of traditional nausea meds. It work well and I now use it at home and actually works better than Zofran or Phenagren.,Mmwillis
22,Diphenhydramine,NauseaVomiting,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"December 20, 2015",74,"Benadryl (diphenhydramine):I got a severe back injury about 2 years ago.  Couldn't function pain was so bad.  So my doctor started putting me on codiene, then vicoden, then tramadol, and then so on but they all gave me hours of vomiting, gut wrenching cramps, and sweating.  Read about benadryl being used to prevent this side effect.  I took 3 25 mg tabs.  I know that is one over recommended but I was desperate.  35 mins later I was sitting with my kids and not the trash can for the first time in a while.  I can't believe I didn't figure this out sooner especially with a biotech degree.",A biotechnologist.

I went from Nexium to Zantac to pepto to tums, nothing helped and it all just came back up an hour later.

29,Diphenhydramine,NauseaVomiting,4.0,,"March 6, 2010",6,"I had a severe migraine, was driven to the hospital when regular pain relievers did not work.  I was given IV Benadryl along with an anti-nausea medicine and fluids. I felt sleepy almost immediately, and my pain was lessened.  The huge down side was that I felt a huge amount of anxiety for 48 hours afterward.  I do not suffer from anxiety normally. I believe this was an adverse reaction of the Benadryl. ",Anonymous
