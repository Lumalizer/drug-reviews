0,Haldol,NauseaVomiting,1.0,,"March 27, 2022",0,Given an injection of this for nausea/vomiting. Caused pure terror. Wanted to crawl out of my skin. One of the worst feelings I’ve ever had. Felt like I was truly losing my mind. Would not recommend under any circumstance.,Eric
1,Haldol,NauseaVomiting,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"January 26, 2022",0,Given this drug for nausea after surgery. It dropped my heart rate from 80's down to 40's and dropped my oxygen rate down to low 80's. This is a dangerous drug and not enough warnings on internet. I have Atril Fibulation and COPD. Should not have been given this drug. It was a 1 time shot and lucky to be in hospital at the time,Misty
2,Haldol,NauseaVomiting,10.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"January 16, 2022",0,This is a great drug if you build it up don't start with 5 mg start with 1mg. I have not had any side effects this way.,Rox

4,Haldol,NauseaVomiting,10.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"September 18, 2021",1,"I experience nausea/vomiting related to my epilepsy after I have seizures. Sometimes it will last for over a week and I mean vomiting lasting 4+ hours at a time. Luckily this has no side effects for me besides sleepiness. Makes me feel better within a half hour. Zofran, Reglan and phenegran did me no good. It’s been a lifesaver for me.",Logan
5,Haldol,NauseaVomiting,4.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"February 4, 2021",14,"I was given IV Haldol in the ER yesterday along with zofran, decadron and Benadryl for a migraine w/ nausea.I react terribly to compazine and Reglan (I feel like I can’t stand being in my own skin, want to climb the walls, etc. Indescribable really but AWFUL)! I specifically asked if there was any chance Haldol would cause a similar reaction and was ensured it would not. It did.I’m still agitated, unable to sleep and anxious this morning. I cannot wait until it wears off. Def not worth it.",Francesca
6,Haldol,NauseaVomiting,5.0,,"January 6, 2021",4,"Was in for laparoscopy procedure and was very nauseous after the surgery. Initial treatment with Zofran wasn’t helpful, so they then injected Haldol to relieve the emesis and nausea. It made feel drowsy and restless at the same time. I can’t tell if I’m thankful it helped as an antiemetic or if I absolutely hate it because of the restless legs, anxious, crawling out of my skin feelings. It made resting and sleep very difficult after a reallllllly long day at the hospital. My advice, see if doctor has exhausted all other medications/solutions first! The side effects may make you regret taking it.",Roc
7,Haldol,NauseaVomiting,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"August 29, 2020",15,"Sometime after my same day surgery to treat a cancer tumor, I was given some unspecified amount of Haldol through my IV line. I was shocked when I heard I was given Haldol since it is known as an anti-psychotic drug with very severe side effects I had no idea it was ever used for the prevention of nausea and vomiting over all standard such as Zofran.Since I had same procedure several weeks earlier I was amazed Define the effects of what I thought was just the anesthesia wear so much more severe. I had disorientation, restlessness, anxiety, memory problems, tiredness, sleepiness, constipation, and even some depression. I can only attribute the difference in my reaction to the use of Haldol. It's been about 48 hours since I was discharged from the hospital, and I still don't feel right.My advice to any patient who may be given this drug to treat/prevent nausea and vomiting is to request something else that's much safer. I would certainly never take this again.",Michael
8,Haldol,NauseaVomiting,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"April 23, 2020",18,"I got rushed to the ER for nonstop vomiting. I was vomiting for over 10 hours until I finally decided to go to the hospital. They gave me 2 injections of Zofran but unfortunately, I was still vomiting.Then they gave me a dose of Haldol which finally stopped my vomiting. My horrible stomach cramps were gone as well. I was able to get the best possible sleep. When I woke up, I felt like a million bucks. Haldol definitely saved me!",Jimmy
9,Haldol,NauseaVomiting,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"January 15, 2020",35,They gave me this medicine for stomach pain and all it did was make me loose control physically and mentally. I could not stop moving my arm and legs and I thought I was going to be put in a rubber room scared the life out of me never again,Roxrdt
10,Haldol,NauseaVomiting,,Taken for less than 1 month,"June 27, 2019",24,"Take this medicine if you want the worst experience of your life! This caused extreme restlessness & anxiety. I felt like I couldn't move, and it was hard to talk. IV causes a more serve adverse reaction than IM or oral form. If you get these med, make sure you are ALSO given benadryl, cogentin, or a benzo to prevent these side effects! I was given benadryl & ativan, but they had to give me an extra dose of each because it wasn't helping enough.",Bear
11,Haldol,NauseaVomiting,1.0,,"January 23, 2019",24,"I went to the ED for kidney pain and nausea. I have allergies to IV anti nausea meds but can take them orally. They decided to give me .5 of Haldol intravenously. Something inside me was telling me NOT to allow this, but I was so nauseated and they said it would help. I can take oral anti nauseous meds, so I was confused as to why I was getting haldol. The FDA hasn’t approved the intravenous use of haldol in ER settings. Unfortunately, I found all of this out after the fact. 5 minutes after being injected, I got hot flashes, and a huge panic attack. Benadryl helped but my pulse went to 180bpm and slowly tapered down to 100bpm- that’s where it stayed until this evening where I’m finally at a normal 86bpm. It’s been 2 days, and I’m still feeling agitated, and anxious. My advice to anyone being offered haldol: if an ER doc wants to try to see if it works for you-say no, ask for something safer!",Manders
12,Haldol,NauseaVomiting,10.0,,"June 21, 2018",4,Worked great and quickly,tre
13,Haldol,NauseaVomiting,2.0,,"January 8, 2018",19,Went to ER for uncontrollable vomiting and stomach pain. Haldol was the second try (injection) to improve my symptoms. I am shocked reading all of these other experiences because of the similarity to my case. The haldol helped with the nausea and vomiting but oh my goodness the body cramps and restlessness. My entire body was a giant Charlie horse contorting all over the table and I couldn't stop it. Crying in pain. They finally gave me something else which toned it down some but no way would I ever want to go through that again. I'm sorry for those who have experienced it. It's horrendous :(,D_D
14,Haldol,NauseaVomiting,2.0,,"August 19, 2017",12,"Still felt nauseous after being given this drug after surgery. I woke up extremely sick and vomiting. This was the third drug given to help combat these effects. I didn't know I'd been given it but my heart started racing and concerned the nursing staff, and their concern made me anxious. I was so scared and paranoid about what was happening to me which I later found out was all because of this drug. They ended up flushing it out of my system.",77777777
15,Haldol,NauseaVomiting,3.0,,"May 25, 2017",30,"Was given this in the ER for nausea. It killed the nausea, sure, but I was so anxious! I felt as though if I stayed in that hospital bed another second I was going to go crazy. When I was released I raced home and took Xanex to try and combat the anxiety. It's been about 26 hours since I was injected and I still have the urge to move and run around, like restless leg syndrome. I'd rather just be nauseous!",Lyssa64
16,Haldol,NauseaVomiting,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"February 13, 2017",28,"Went to the ER after experiencing chest pain following advice from my surgery nurse. While being there I mentioned being slightly nauseous. I am extremely allergic to most anti nausea medications going into anaphylactic shock , so I was given haldol. immediately after injection, my heart began beating faster and my anxiety level flew off the chart. Every muscle in my body wanted to move and spasm, I was practically vibrating in the bed seeing as it was only days after having my abdomen cut into it was pretty intense. It was the closest I have ever felt to being out of my mind. I had to be given another medication to counteract the effect of the haldol in my system.",Anonymous
17,Haldol,NauseaVomiting,1.0,,"August 14, 2016",17,"I went to the er for stomach cramping and tenderness after a bought of stomach flu. For some reason they used this instead of Zofran or Phenergan first. I had horrible side effects. Every muscle in my body spasmed to the point of nearly dislocating my jaw. It took a full 36 hours to leave my system. Benadryl helped, but did not reverse the effects. I was disoriented and screaming in pain only a few seconds after receiving it. Use caution. The side effects were not worth it.",Snowf14
18,Haldol,NauseaVomiting,8.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"February 16, 2013",33,"Experiencing horrible nausea/vomiting with Dilaudid for pain associated with Stage4 Breast cancer. My normal antinausea medication was Zofran, but it started to not work. I was given 0.5 mg I.V. of Haldol every hour for nausea. It worked, but did ""knock me to nap"" for a little while. After I woke up, I did feel groggy and was able to eat and drink without incident.",Stage4Diva
19,Haldol,NauseaVomiting,10.0,,"January 15, 2013",26,I have Addison's disease we had tried all conventional medications. I got this injected by the ER and told my dr that even though they gave it to me for anxiety I didn't vomit or get nauseous for 24 hrs.,Misty Sierra
20,Haldol,NauseaVomiting,1.0,,"March 3, 2010",77,"Haldol was given to my mother for nausea/vomiting in her final days/weeks of battling colon cancer. Haldol worked great for nausea but the side effects were horrible. She was not drowsy, she was out! Not coherent, confused, wasn't able to eat and at times was agitated. Be very careful using this medication. It took two days after stopping the medication for it to leave her system and return to a normal state of mind.",Anonymous
