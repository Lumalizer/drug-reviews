0,Dramamine,NauseaVomiting,7,Taken for less than 1 month,"October 16, 2021",0,"First morning I wake up in Mexico and I have this urge to throw up, and I do so right outside my room. 2 hours go by and I’m still feeling super nauseous. I run down to the store in my resort and I was recommended Dramamine (which was also like $20). Honestly it made me throw up even more; a lot more. but I will say that it made me feel better after getting all the vomit out so I guess it kind of worked? I still feel a little nauseous hopefully it goes away in a bit.",tooturnt
1,Dramamine,NauseaVomiting,10,,"July 16, 2021",0,I’m taking the Dramamine-N for dizziness which was then causing nausea and vomiting not related to travel at all and within about one half hour I’m feeling good!  Highly recommend for this problem.,Anonymous
2,Dramamine,NauseaVomiting,10,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"October 26, 2020",7,"I have indigestion issues really bad ,I rarely drink alcohol ,but when I do drink it’s usually one drink or two because my stomach hates it. Not thinking and being stupid one day drank too much and got sick nauseous . Could not hold down even water. I took 2 Dramamine because the vomiting would not stop and finally I felt more calm and my stomach eased up. Lesson learned oh and it helps with my anxiety and insomnia .",Wally
3,Dramamine,NauseaVomiting,10,Taken for less than 1 month,"July 26, 2020",12,"Went out with my friends on a Saturday night, got home around 3AM. Had to wake up at 6AM for work and I woke up with the spins and felt like throwing up. I continued to feel like this for the remainder of the shift until I saw Dramamine at the gas station on my lunch break. Decided to take 2 and I felt soooo much better. This brought back my appetite and stopped the spinning/nausea.",Nck
4,Dramamine,NauseaVomiting,1,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"May 19, 2020",3,The dramamine  helped my nausea and vomiting for a few days and then lost its charm. It hasn't worked since.,AlwaysPuking
5,Dramamine,NauseaVomiting,10,Taken for less than 1 month,"February 28, 2020",14,"My family came down with the stomach flu it was bad. I went looking for something that would help but wasn't to expensive, I came across Dramamine and I have to say one after taking one pill it works wonders and it last for 24 hours we've had to take another one but it works I highly recommend it.",Chocolate
6,Dramamine,NauseaVomiting,10,Taken for 5 to 10 years,"January 18, 2020",18,"I have acid reflux and gastroparesis, so am nauseous most of the time since meds don't work. I found taking just a half of one of the regular generic of dramamine (Equate sold at Wal-Mart) helps tremendously. It evens help with the coughing, since it calms me down without any drowsiness. I also take ginger root nausea med, and just add the equate if needed as a ""boost"".  Can you tell that I've learned, through years, that doctors just try selling drugs that just don't do anything but sell for them?",Lee
7,Dramamine,NauseaVomiting,5,,"December 23, 2019",3,Never really seemed to work for me as I tried taking it with the stomach flu. I still feel like I’m going to hurl.,Anonymous
8,Dramamine,NauseaVomiting,9,Taken for less than 1 month,"March 8, 2019",13,"Although it does not take all of the nausea away, it takes it away enough to avoid vomiting when the stomach bug is running its course. Although not indicated for gastroenteritis (aka ""stomach flu""), I have used it on many occasions as I own a business; and any day not at work is lost income. I also give it to my children when they are feeling ill enough to vomit. Note- Bonine (meclizine) and ""Less-Drowsy Dramamine (meclizine) which our also motion sickness medicine, works even pretty well, but not as well in my opinion for nausea caused by actual sickness.",sfckusarmy
9,Dramamine,NauseaVomiting,10,Taken for less than 1 month,"March 7, 2017",12,Sometimes after a night of partying I become nauseous. One of my customers suggested Dramamine after I threw up. Now I can party all night! My revenue is up as I can still work. Thank you dramamine! (oh and a side note Dramamine works a lot better taken orally compared to rectally but what do I know I'm just a 30 year old man. Go nuts!),No tummy ache
10,Dramamine,NauseaVomiting,10,Taken for 10 years or more,"March 2, 2016",31,"For me, dramamine  works better than phenergan. I have a lot of nausea due to rheumatoid medications I take. I also get vertigo or migraine on occasion that cause nausea. This med helps me a lot",RAsurvivor

12,Dramamine,NauseaVomiting,10,,"April 16, 2015",50,Need Something over the counter now...This stuff works. Use as directed every 4 hours and promise you your nausea and vomiting will disappear.. I still think Zofran (Prescription ONLY) is the best stuff but this is a close second for over the counter.,robbyzombie
13,Dramamine,NauseaVomiting,9,,"December 2, 2014",35,In College I had a bad reaction to a medication and spent the entire day in bed and throwing up until my roommate gave me Dramamine and it completely took away the vomiting and helped me go to sleep. ,Renee_4
14,Dramamine,NauseaVomiting,10,,"August 16, 2014",49,"For me, it works miracles. When I used to drink I'd get the worst hangovers because of the horrible stomach ache and vomiting. If I take this, I know in one  hour exactly (it literally takes exactly 60 minutes for me) I will feel better and not even a little nauseous. I also get nasty random bouts of nausea (I have no idea why). Before knowing about Dramamine, I'd have to force myself to vomit just to feel a little bit of relief but after finding this stuff, I no longer suffer. I do not know what I will do if this medicine is ever discontinued. ",Ms. Teacher
15,Dramamine,NauseaVomiting,10,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"November 22, 2013",47,I take this for dizziness which is caused by a prescription medicine I take and it takes dizziness away and helps with anxiety! Non drowsy formula is a better ingredient than the original and only makes me slightly tired! Great medicine!,sassamouth
16,Dramamine,NauseaVomiting,9,Taken for less than 1 month,"December 28, 2012",93,"I had to stop taking my migraine medicine because of a life threatening side effect.  Nothing else touched my migraines.  I was desperate because of the nausea and dizziness on top of the unbelievable pain, and took a Dramamine.  Not only did it stop the nausea and dizziness, it knocked out my migraine enough that I was able to get out aof bed and function - probably from a 10 on the pain scale to a 5.  Huge difference!",12 year migraine sufferer

18,Dramamine,NauseaVomiting,9,,"June 18, 2011",78,"During a migraine attack, I took a Dramamine to help me sleep (as, yes, it packs a wallop in the drowsy department). It did make me a little drowsy, but what was more interesting is that my migraine went from a ""10"" to a ""4"" on the pain scale. Now when I start to get migraine symptoms, I take an Excedrin and a Dramamine. The combination works tremendously for me.",Jennygrrl27
19,Dramamine,NauseaVomiting,8,,"November 26, 2009",35,My doctor advised taking Dramamine after he gave me medicine to treat my problems - not motion sickness - and I experienced nausea and some vomiting from the medicine. I had tried various things that just seemed to make it worse but this helps. Now I can take the medicine I need and still be comfortable.,neeleymountain
