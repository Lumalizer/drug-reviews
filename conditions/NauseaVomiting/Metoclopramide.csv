0,Metoclopramide,NauseaVomiting,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"March 14, 2022",0,"I was admitted to the emergency department for intense vomiting due to general anaesthesia drugs. They gave me this medication through an IV and almost INSTANTLY, my body went into COMPLETE SHOCK. It's a difficult feeling to describe, and iI've never felt ANYTHING like this before. I was screaming, moving around, feeling a bit dizzy, sick, and it felt like I wanted to RIP MY SKIN OUT. The feeling was insufferable. It was like the feeling of nails against a chalkboard, but in my body. The nurse didn't seem to care and just said ""You're fine, sometimes people have a reaction to this drug. There's nothing we can do"". I was pacing around crying out for help and having an anxiety attack. As many other reviews of this drug have said, I felt the extreme urge to RIP the IV out of my arm. It all became too much and I felt suicidal thoughts creep in. Eventually I discharged myself and the only thing that helped calm me down was valium. DO NOT TAKE THIS DRUG",WORST
1,Metoclopramide,NauseaVomiting,,Taken for less than 1 month,"March 9, 2022",0,"Reglan (metoclopramide):I went to the ER for non-stop vomiting & they gave me Reglan through the IV. I was already sitting in the room waiting to be treated for 3 hours so I was already annoyed but once they administer the Reglan & left me there for what would’ve been more hours, I felt like I was going insane. Never in my life have I felt so manic, I called my husband stuttering to him saying I’m gonna rip the IV out my arm! I have to get out of this hospital! So he told me to calm down & maybe someone would come check on me but a hour passed & I finally lost it & dialed the nurse to discharge me from the hospital asap. I felt so embarrassed & kept saying I don’t know why I feel like this but I was too restless & my anxiety was literally making me crazy. They never warned me of any side effects.",Nikki

Reglan was added after zofran and meclizine didn’t totally resolve symptoms. Same as others, I experienced the worst agitation of my life. Screaming, thrashing, begging them to knock me unconscious. It was horrific. They gave me Ativan and Benadryl, eventually I fell asleep. They said, Oh some people react this way. I can’t believe they continue to use a drug that does this.",never take this

If you go into the ER for nausea and vomiting and they tell you their going to administer this medication into your IV, tell them absolutely not! I suffered from Hyperthemsis Gravidarum for the first 3 months of my pregnancy that landed me in the ER five times and I had to be put on IV fluids the first couple times they gave me zofran which worked the first and second time and then it just started making my nausea and vomiting worse. The next couple times I came into the ER and I told them the zofran was making me feel worse they decided to give me Reglan and oh my god I had never felt this way from a medication before after ten mins of them giving it to me I started shaking and feeling the worse anxiety I've ever felt and I have anxiety disorder.

6,Metoclopramide,NauseaVomiting,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"January 9, 2022",1,"Reglan (metoclopramide):Just like many others have said, I was given this in the ER for nausea and vomiting. TERRIBLE!!!! Do NOT let a doctor give you this medicine!!!! It makes you feel mentally insane and violently ill! Your entire body shakes, intense muscle cramping and contortions, nerve pain, panic attacks, have the urge to rip out the IV and escape the hospital bed, dizzy, confusion, uncontrollable body movements. Like many others have said as well, this medication can truly be PTSD inducing, especially if you have history of anxiety/depression. I thought I was insane until I saw the amount of people with the same bizarre side effects. And it didn't even touch my nausea or vomiting issue in the slightest! Can't believe this medication is even used still in ER or hospital settings. Stick to safe nausea medications like Zofran (ondansetron). The only one I trust, even if it doesn't always work. At least it won't drive you to insanity.",Carly

Very severe vomiting and nausea during my second pregnancy. My doctors refused to give me anything to treat hyperemesis during my first pregnancy and they may have been right.  I had such severe  nausea and vomiting that I was sick all day every day and vomited at minimum 10x a day . So whenI went to the ER and was given IV fluids , Zofran and a prescription for Reglan I thought it was a cure . Little did I know the toll it would take on my mental health, racing thoughts . I tried stopping Reglan one month after beginning it and was okay for a few days but the nausea came back with a vengeance . I started back taking it but just couldn’t shake the feeling of being unwell and depression. So I finally stopped taking it after about 4 months on the medication. It’s only been a few days but I’m depressed and still not feeling 100 percent. There is no winning if I don’t eat I hurt my baby and if I take this medicine I have another hurt",Anonymous

9,Metoclopramide,NauseaVomiting,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"December 11, 2021",0,Took due to nausea during pregnancy (currently 22 weeks and still not much better). Tried 10mg x 3 times daily for a week but no improvement so I stopped. It didn't seem to adversely affect me. I was already extremely depressed because of the morning sickness and exhausted and I don't believe this medication made it any worse.

10,Metoclopramide,NauseaVomiting,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"November 3, 2021",1,Reglan (metoclopramide):I was given this in my IV while admitted for severe dehydration. Within 5 minutes I had a full blown panic attack that Xanax couldn't even touch. They did not tell me any of the side effects I have now read up on after that experience. I had to be discharged against medical advice because the attack was so severe I was going crazy in the room. I tried to rip my IV out from it bothering me so badly after that and they luckily came and took it out. It all started with the IV making me feel insane. My whole arm that it was administered in felt like I wanted it gone from my body that it was some foreign object touching me. I will never take this medicine again. I couldn't tell you if it helped the nausea or not because I ended up throwing up from the panic attack.,Rae

Worse reaction of my life. I jumped up and started passing out to the floor, felt like I needed to crawl out of my skin. My heart rate was tachycardia. It was worse than the nausea and it didn't help. I did get it through an IV with benadryl because they said it makes people want to crawl out of their skin.

13,Metoclopramide,NauseaVomiting,1.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"September 7, 2021",0,"Metoclopramide is the worst medication I have ever been given. I was given metoclopramide twice daily, along with  Cyclizine and Ondansetron, for vomiting 2016-17.  Due to the severity of my vomiting the side effects weren't noticed straight away by myself or family. The hospital didn't notice for over a year!This medication, from this little I can remember made me dribble uncontrollably, I was unable to talk but would scream in pain, depression crept in and became paranoid about anything medical. A nurse finally noticed my reaction in 2017, over a year later, after walking back in to my room 10mins after giving me my medication. I was given this every time I was admitted over 2016-2017. Would NOT recommend this medication to anyone, EVER. I take the other antiemetics daily, with no issues to manage my symptoms.",Anonymous

Although Benadryl was part of the infusion I still had horrible symptoms. First I started to hallucinate. Then fell asleep began having nightmares of suffocation. Nurse woke me and I still couldn’t orient myself and just kept saying help me  over and over my whole body jerking and arms especially spastic . I couldn’t stay awake and kept falling back then immediately waking with my whole body jerking and my arms and legs flailing around so bad I couldn’t use the call button or even pick it up.

I don’t throw up all day like I did with my first born, but the nausea makes it impossible to really eat or even take sips of water. I threw up my water yesterday and it was the final straw, sending me to UC. The doctor ordered 2L of NS and a reglan push. I too felt like taking the IV out of my arm, but I was also uncomfortable and shaking because, of course, the NS doesn’t feel so comfortable entering your body. I felt pretty ill for 15 minutes, then I knocked out. Honestly, after I felt way better. The nausea was non existent and I actually had an appetite where I was craving foods again. I didn’t want to take reglan, but I’ve tried all the tips and tricks one can do. I do not want to take it again, just because I don’t like taking medication during pregnancy, but it really helped. Today I’m back to barely having any appetite, for both food and water.",Lex

I began experiencing panic attacks in the third trimester of my last pregnancy. At the time I was using maxalon but I had put it down to hormones.

I remember telling the doctors and nurse drain my blood.  Get this out of me.  Sounds dramatic and crazy, because it really was.  How I recall them telling me it was a bad reaction to this medicine I’m not sure... just remember looking at my dad as they held me down and sedated me with benadryl.

I obviously don't want to take ANY medicines while pregnant, but the risk of not eating and drinking has become much worse.  I've had 3 I.V.'s.  I tried Unisom with B6, Zofran, even Phenergan.  Nothing touches the vomiting.  Reglan is the only medicine that will stop the vomiting AND allow me to eat and drink.  I take it only when I'm totally desperate, but it is a miracle.",EllieJoey

148,Metoclopramide,NauseaVomiting,8.0,,"January 3, 2012",30,Reglan (metoclopramide):I have been taking this medicine off and on for about 2 years. When I first started I hated it because it made me feel anxious and depressed and emotional. I was on 10mg a few times a day. It took the sickness away but I couldn't handle the side effects so I stopped and the sickness came back. Finally the Dr. cut it down to 5mg and I felt so much better with that. The side effects were gone and sickness was controlled too. I'm doing very well with this medicine but the long term use still has me nervous because I don't want to develop tremors later. So far so good and I feel pretty good.,Anonymous

On both occasions, within minutes I was very anxious.  On the operating table I had an anxiety attack and was begging for someone to help me.  Everyone just thought I was freaking out because it was a c-section.  I thought I had gone crazy.  It ruined both of my childbirth experiences because I didn't care about the birth - all I wanted was to crawl out of my skin and disappear so I could get away from the awful panic and anxiety.  Although I was physically present for the birth, mentally and emotionally I had checked out.  ",Anonymous
