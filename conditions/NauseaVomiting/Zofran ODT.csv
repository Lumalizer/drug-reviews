0,Zofran ODT,NauseaVomiting,10.0,Taken for 10 years or more,"March 9, 2022",0,"I have been taking Ondansetron, 4 mg ODT for years to treat severe nausea after I eat too many carbs during a meal.  When I feel the nausea starting, I put 2 tablets under my tongue followed by a Chewy Tum and a Prilosec ODT.  I was given Promethazine before Zofran was available to me which worked fantastic cuz it puts you to sleep and you sleep thru the nausea episode which is not practical when you are working. Zofran saved me by allowing me to recover from nausea episodes taking 30 minutes out of my day vs 1/2 or entire day off work. Great drug!!!",Renee

My nausea and vomiting is so severe that I do need to take double the recommended dose, however it does work. I have never had a single side effect from Zofran. I understand this drug might not work for some people, but for me it is great!",Abby1573646
3,Zofran ODT,NauseaVomiting,10.0,Taken for 10 years or more,"December 13, 2021",0,"Frequent migraines and Cervicogenic headaches often make me extremely nauseous, which subsequently may cause me to vomit, not a good occurrence with massive headaches. I’ve also had intractable vomiting, and received zofran IV or suppository (effective but unpleasant). I’ve tried other anti nausea medications to little effect. 1 dissolving tablet at the onset of pain-related nausea works extremely well for me. In over a decade of taking it (including while pregnant) I’ve had no side effects despite being on a number of medications.",MDDMom
4,Zofran ODT,NauseaVomiting,10.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"November 30, 2021",0,"Zofran is a miracle drug for me. I always have some on hand. I suffer from GERD, IBS, gastritis, malabsorption, endometriosis, and the list goes on. Nausea is a nagging symptom that I have often, and I vomit on a regular basis. Zofran has kept me out of the ER on many occasions due to severe vomiting. It also gets me through the occasional rounds of antibiotics as they really mess with my stomach. It does cause some pretty bad headaches when taken on a regular basis, but I will take a headache over vomiting any day. Could not recommend enough! It has been a total lifesaver!",Anonymous
5,Zofran ODT,NauseaVomiting,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"November 22, 2021",0,"I took ondansetron swallow-pill at 4mg and it was starting to help. My physician increased the dose to 8mg but it was now a mouth dissolving-format and made my nausea FAR WORSE.

6,Zofran ODT,NauseaVomiting,7.0,,"June 11, 2021",4,"I’ve been using Zofran for a couple years after it was given to me in the hospital for nausea, following surgery.  It has always worked beautifully in combatting those days when I or a friend have felt nauseated. But the last time I took one , in February, during the night when awakened by stomach pain and nausea, it actually made things worse by adding an immediate head ache, and extreme heart palpitations..that lasted a good half hour, with out helping my initial nausea at all. I’ve been afraid to use it ever since.  Turns out I was experiencing a gallbladder attack, and I’m not certain that wasn’t the reason the Zofran failed.  Today, I’m having one of those icky nauseated days, two doses of Emetrol have not helped, so I took a Zofran and cut it in half, yes, they are already small, but I was nervous.  Im happy to report, it seems to have worked. Nausea is nearly gone now. No headache, no increased heart rate. I'm hoping Zofran is once more my friend.",Cindy Halloween
7,Zofran ODT,NauseaVomiting,1.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"April 20, 2021",28,"This medication makes me more nauseous than before taking it. After 3 surgeries and multiple nausea filled days due to a chronic health condition, I’ve concluded that this drug makes things worse for me. I kept hoping it was all in my head, but other anti nausea meds (and even peppermint) work almost immediately, at least to a certain extent. Whereas this always makes me 10x worse to the point of vomiting. It also gives me really bad headaches and I don’t ever get headaches in general. It’s the only medication that gives me this side effect. So I think this either works very well for people, or makes it worse. I’m wondering if it has to do with brain chemistry since it’s a serotonin blocker? I’m severely ADHD with mild OCD and depression. Perhaps certain brain wiring just doesn’t benefit. I’d love more research to be done on this since it’s the standard anti nausea treatment given in hospitals.",Pickled
8,Zofran ODT,NauseaVomiting,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"February 22, 2021",10,"Horrible drug for me. Actually makes me nauseous and throw up. Nothing tastes right on this medication. One dose had me throwing up and nauseous, not able to eat for a couple days. One dose had me constipated for about 5 days before I was back to normal (with taking stool softeners Rx after surgery). May work for some but for me it’s a NO go.",Catstone

I love this medication but the only side effect I have is constipation but I usually just take a Senakot or just eat the Fiber 1 bars. It works quickly.

Now, I just take it on the times I feel nauseated with the patch, which is not much.

The minty flavor really drove me over the edge, and only made matters worse. Then my doc gave me the regular tablets that you swallow with a tiny bit of water, but it didn't help at all, either. I remember being awed by the knowledge that they give this med to sick cancer patients, when it is so horribly ineffective.

I had other symptoms, but the nausea was the worst. It just got worse and more frequent. My mother talked me into going in and I was diagnosed with ""migraine with aura"" about a month ago. I don't feel like migraines have anything to do with the nausea, but that's all I have to go on for now. The nausea comes in waves and I've had to stop doing schoolwork because of it. I was hoping the zofran would help, but it doesn't seem to do anything. I still wake up at night because I'm so nauseous, and it never seems to end.",SadGrace
