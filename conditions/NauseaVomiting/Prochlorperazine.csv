0,Prochlorperazine,NauseaVomiting,,,"March 31, 2022",0,"Compazine (prochlorperazine):This is not the first time this happened to me, this is just the first time I found out what the drug was called. In the last 10 years I have been to the ER for severe headache and was given something in my IV, every single time within seconds I felt panicked. I have explained this to the ER personel each time but they gave it to me anyway. This time was the worst! I wanted to pull my skin off, scream, leave everything. I couldn't  stay still and my boyfriend watched in horror as I sobbed. He tried to rub my back as comfort and I yelled at him to Please stop touching me and talking (I felt so bad). I truly think I must be allergic to this medicine. When I begged her to reverse it she said she couldn't but some more benadryl which may dull the affects. It didn't work. Now I am scared to death of any medications. It has been 3 months and even now when I think about it I get panicked. So traumatizing",Kelli
1,Prochlorperazine,NauseaVomiting,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"March 24, 2022",0,"Compazine (prochlorperazine):Awful drug. Was given this as part of a drug cocktail for vomiting that wouldn’t stop. Just a couple minutes after the nurse put it in my IV I felt terror like never before. The worst anxiety I’ve ever felt. Couldn’t be still. Jerky movements. I felt like was coming out of my skin. I literally wanted to rip the IV out and run. My heart rate went up and the nurse was concerned so the dr ended up giving me cogentin, which helped some. It took me days to feel normal again. I now have this on my allergy list. I’m not sure why doctors resort to these cocktails for nausea/vomiting instead of giving zofran. I don’t know why these types of drugs are even still on the market. I understand now why people who suffer from mental illness have a hard time staying on these medications. The side effects are awful.",Jessa92

The hospital didn't have phenergan IV so they went with Compazine. It was given with benadryl and the only warning I got was that it might make me sleepy. It made me sleepy but if I closed my eyes I would forget to breathe and gasp. Like everyone else I felt like I wanted to crawl out of my skin. I cried, pinched myself a lot, can't stop moving, can't get comfortable. I'm praying this leaves my system soon because this is much worse than the anxiety attacks I already suffer from. (Which the doctor who ordered the medicine knew about) This medication should be recalled and discontinued. Add this to your allergy list unless you have no other option",Never again

When I searched, it came up with this site and it seems like I’m one of the lucky ones to have not had horrendous side effects.  I was prescribed dissolvable tablets that you put between your lip and gum and within an hour I had finally stopped being sick every few minutes, which was a massive relief.  I didn’t have any negative side effects from the tablets and they did what they were supposed to do.  I’m so sorry for everyone else on here who had such horrendous side effects.  It seems that bad reactions are more common than not, so I’m surprised that the drug is still used.  It seems that most people who reacted badly were given the medication intravenously and mine was oral, so I wonder if that makes a difference to how you react to it.",FeelingLucky81

I went into the ER with a headache and nausea, and was given benadryl and compazine via IV in order to quell it. Immediately after the IV went in I started to feel very anxious and have dark thoughts. All I wanted to do was jump out of the hospital bed and run out. Once I was discharged from the hospital the side effects did not go away. I felt like I just wanted to be knocked out to help stop this feeling. I cannot even believe I was able to get sleep that night, but thankfully I did. Even though I got sleep however, it is the next day and I still feel restless and jittery. It is a lot better now, but I do not know how much longer it will last. DO NOT TAKE COMPAZINE!!!!",Owen

I immediately started feeling panicked and restless and my heart rate shot up to 130 even though I was lying down. I ripped out my IV, got up, and paced around, convinced that I would feel like that forever. The nurse came in and told me it was normal and just wrapped me tight in warm blankets so I couldn't move. I couldn't stop shaking and crying until it went away a couple of hours later. Even the Benadryl they gave me as an antidote didn't work. I was wrong in thinking this was a rare side effect!

For me though it has been a life changer. Prochlorperazine not only helps me tremendously with my nausea and vomiting due to having Ulcerative Colitis but it also helps manage my anxiety and has knocked my migraines down from 5 to 6 times a week to about 2 migraines a month.

I had an extreme urge to leave the hospital, I felt that I was not safe, I hit the call button over and over begging for someone to help me. I was extremely restless, my jaw was chattering, I couldn’t stop moving my legs, I felt like I was crawling out of my skin. The nurses had to perform an EKG on my heart as I started having abnormal heart rhythms. After 20 - 30 minutes I was able calm myself down, however, I kept jerking awake with every sound, movement, or voice.

Bugs felt like they were crawling in my skin. I felt crazy. Because of the Medicine, I developed akathisia and still recovering almost a month later. I do understand that meds work different for everyone, but there’s a reason everyone had the same experience on this. Worst med I’ve ever taken. Never take any Antipsychotic-Antimetic such as compazine, inapsine, and Regalin because they all have the same side effects. They are usually given in migraine cocktails in emergency rooms.

She told me it was for anti nausea then said  we give this for all migraines and inserted it into my IV before I could even say no. I was fine for 5 minutes until I walked to the bathroom and immediately knew something was wrong. I could barely remember why I had gone in there in the first place and started having extreme anxiety. I have had anxiety attacks before but this was completely different.

18,Prochlorperazine,NauseaVomiting,10.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"December 12, 2021",0,"I was given prochlorperazine to help with chemotherapy related nausea and it worked great, no problems at all, but I didn't take it often. Just ""as needed"" which started out at once a day then became once a week or so as my nausea subsided.Now I keep the drug on hand for when I get what I call ""sick-hungry"". Sometimes I'll suddenly get nauseous from hunger when a few minutes prior I hadn't thought myself hungry at all. And ""sick-hungry"" tends to make me not want to do the ONE THING that is needed - which is eat. The prochlorperazine is incredibly helpful for that. It quickly calms the nausea so that I can eat. I'm pretty sure this straddles the line of ""off brand usage"" but since it works I haven't thought much about that.Side note: I did develop general anxiety from the cancer and chemo that hasn't entirely gone away, but I've never noticed the prochlorperazine affecting my anxiety for better or worse, but that's probably because I don't take it often, maybe once every 2-3 weeks.",Cris

When I tried to go to bed and sleep, the spasm wouldn't stop. They were all over my body, in my neck, chest, legs, arms. It was very uncomfortable. My mum called an ambulance and they brought me to the ER. By the time I reached the ER I couldn't move any part of my body except my eyes. My body had turned to stone. It was the most frightening thing I have ever experienced. I was very lucky that a nurse on duty had a patient with this before and she knew what to administer.

I came down with a low-grade fever and intense acid burn. Thankfully, I remembered that I had this med left over from a recent surgery. The acid burn is down and my 100 degree temp stabilized to 99.5.  So far, it is working for me as I've been proactive before the nausea sensation strikes. Sadly, I'm down to two pills so will see if I can, at least, bypass the vomiting phase of this horrific virus.",BMommy123

I have had every test in the book and they all come back negative. I've tried medications for irritable bowel syndrome and I've tried Phenegran and Zofran. None of which worked. I also used the transdermal Scoplamine patch, which helped a little. Finally, my doctor prescribed Compazine suppository and I have had great relief of my nausea/vomiting. I hope to be able to stay on this for a long time. It is a wonder medicine.",Meeeeeeee
275,Prochlorperazine,NauseaVomiting,10.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"January 31, 2014",22,"I suffer from occasional vomiting from acid indigestion brought on by major anxiety. I take Protonix daily for indigestion & also Buspar for anxiety which has helped drastically. However sometimes the anxiety is so extreme I will still get nausea & vomiting. That's when I go to my trusted friend Compazine. It lasts well past 8 hours & gives me time to relax & calm my anxiety (which is near to impossible to do while you are throwing up stomach acid every few minutes%u2026). I have also been prescribed Zofran which also works very well, but is a lot more expensive. I have not experienced any side effects with either medicine. Compazine has saved me more than a few times when I have an appointment I can't afford to miss & that I am anxious over.",Kitakitkaiti

Due to this, and the long term effects they can have, I try to limit the amount I take and am finding that one tablet every three days is generally doing the trick.  Due to the length of time the headaches last and the length of time between taking tablets, this suggests to me that they stay in your system for a few days.  As I have been an insomniac for a few years now, I cannot comment on the drowsiness.  In summary, they are not perfect but are an acceptable alternative to spending my day in work vomiting and staggering round like a drunk, which happened more than once before I started taking these tablets.",Anonymous
