0,Zofran,NauseaVomiting,10.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"March 14, 2022",0,"Zofran is the best drug for nausea! I suffer from Cyclic Vomiting Syndrome, which doctors say is the worst form of nausea. I get extreme nausea that doesn’t get better after vomiting and each time I have a flare up, it lasts 12 hours. Zofran is the only thing that will stop it. It makes me a little tired, but I’ll take that any day over the nausea. I use the disintegrating tablets, which are great for when you feel like you can’t swallow a pill from the nausea.",Smile635
1,Zofran,NauseaVomiting,6.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"January 4, 2022",1,"It works okay. I wish it worked better for me because I struggle greatly with nausea and vomiting due to anxiety and panic disorder as well as IBS. I have still vomited despite taking this medication before. Doctors love to prescribe it because its very tolerable, but it won't be a cure all. It works maybe 75% of the time to prevent vomiting. Helps just slightly with nausea. But it's better than nothing! Only side effect I get is dizziness and mild headache.",Carly
2,Zofran,NauseaVomiting,6.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"December 6, 2021",1,"I use the sublingual. Every time I take it, I envision the guys designing this: ""We're making an anti-nausea sublingual medication? Great! Let's give it the nastiest fake berry flavor we can possibly come up with. That will help nausea, right?""It really is disgusting. I use it because it doesn't make me sleepy and dangerous to drive like promethazine does, but it's not nearly as effective. It works for queasiness, but on full blown nausea its pretty worthless. But for just queasiness, it's relatively effective",Joan
3,Zofran,NauseaVomiting,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"December 4, 2021",1,"Zofran made me feel worse & more nauseous rather than helping. I sincerely feel compassion for everyone that has experienced this from this medicine, & yet your doctor has not believed you, or looked at you in disbelief not having sincere compassion, empathy and kindness when you know that taking it, made you feel more nauseous immediately, throwing up as you combatted the watery feeling trying not to, and realizing the medicine made you feel worse instead of better. My daughter also was prescribed zofran during a time that she was nauseous. I did not tell her initially of my prior experience taking zofran, because I realized medicines have different effects on different people.Of course, I was hoping it would help her & my daughter would feel better immediately or soon after taking it. She experienced the side effects that I did & told me adamantly she’s not taking anymore zofran! It made her feel more nauseous and worse, instead of better.I understand.",Faith

10,Zofran,NauseaVomiting,8.0,,"April 22, 2021",20,"I have Hyperemesis gravidarum (HG) and have been miserable. Zofran is keeping me out of the ER right now. At first I noticed it made me a little dizzy and it still makes me feel just a little weird within the first hour but it’s extremely tolerable. The constipation is super annoying but talk to your doctor about it if that’s an issue and you can probably take something to help that. It stops me from throwing up but I am still definitely nauseous. Brings it from like a 10 to a 5 or 6 maybe but I can EAT now. That is huge. I am eating small meals when I haven’t had a meal in weeks. I’ve been barely eating and drinking. I am completely dependent on zofran to be any type of functional right now. It makes me a little tired but also gives me more energy to not just stay in bed all day because it makes me feel better. Highly recommend, just watch out for the side effects I mentioned. Nothing to be scared of extremely tolerable for me :)",Hggirl

I found out I was pregnant and was slightly nauseous all day everyday but with someone who fears vomiting greatly, I was scared and upset. My doctor finally prescribed me zofran after visiting the hospital for nausea and it has been helping me ever since. I have been taking it for 4 years now whenever I need it And it takes it away immediately. So thankful",I hate nausea

Massive headache which I did not know or was told can be a side effect. Released from ER 2 hrs later MASSIVE MASSIVE HEADACHE! Headache got worse and worse over the next 3 days. Had to then take Excedrine for headache and had instant digestive pain - NEVER EVER IN MY LIFE HAVE I HAD DIGESTIVE PAIN! Within 24 hrs had shoulder pain in both shoulders - that radiated down both arms.  Nausea gone and vomit gone next day. Since Tuesday at the ER I am bedridden still on Sat. with massive headache still - shoulder pain and what feels like an ulcer. I'd have been better off living through the vomit.

My wife has been given it several times in the hospital for the same thing. No results. Seems like the hospitals try to force this particular nausea medicine first.

I also have a HUGE fear of vomiting. This pill has always worked and kept me from vomiting, but on occasion the nausea sticks around but it’s nothing too terrible. I don’t know what I would do without this medication. It helps me live a normal life. I take 4 mg every 4-6 hours as needed, if it’s a rough day I’ll take 8 mg every 6-8 hours.

Also, now again for gastroparesis.  Sometimes the nausea and fullness in my stomach is very uncomfortable.

32,Zofran,NauseaVomiting,9.0,,"August 19, 2019",22,"This is the best medicine for vomiting I  have ever had. I was on IV antibiotics with a lot of side effects, esp nausea and the antibiotics could not be changed and I literally could not hold down water. I had to be on them for 3 months and Zofran (both IV and ODT) helped me immensely. I was able to drink and even eat little with much less nausea. People have to remember no medication may make symptoms resolve completely every time but this comes pretty close. When I took it for regular nausea from a virus or something it worked like 100% nausea gone. For me there was no side effects, and again people have to remember if you're sick some of the symptoms may not be side effects. If your vomiting repeatedly  and are dehydrated of course you're going to have a headache.  But everyone is different so what works for one may not have the same effects for another. But I'm a health care worker and whoever is given Zofran usually has relief so give it a try if ur doctor says it's ok!good luck",Dani

I do want to note that when I was given Zofran in the hospital through the IV I had no issues with nausea it’s only when I take it orally that it does the opposite of what I’d like. All bodies are different and this is just my reaction. I am on a low dose and have not upped the amount I’m taking. $45 dollars for 15 pills (without insurance) and I’ve puked up half of them.
