1,Lorazepam,NauseaVomiting,8.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"March 1, 2022",0,"I was recently diagnosed with CVS (it's been just under a year now). CVS, or Cyclical Vomiting Syndrome, causes episodes/flare up, or 'flares' of severe vomiting & nausea. For me these flares of uncontrolled vomiting & nausea can last anywhere between 1-2 days all the way up to 10 days+, with medication sometimes that time can be shorter.Due to all my current medications, allergies and multiple underlying health conditions I was prescribed Lorazepam 1mg, to take twice a day PRN (only for flares)I've found this to be the best medication I've tried that has helped to control my symptoms when starting or in the middle of flare (if I manage to catch it early enough, I can sometimes sleep through it. Although this has only happened once).",Gem
2,Lorazepam,NauseaVomiting,10.0,Taken for 10 years or more,"January 10, 2021",4,"I've been on this stuff for 14 years now. It was originally prescribed to me when I was 15 years old because my bad back was causing severe nausea and cyclic vomiting. Besides helping with nausea it also works great for sleep, I get a few interdose withdrawals here and there but they aren't severe, after an interdose withdrawal the medication will work like a charm again.",Nikki
3,Lorazepam,NauseaVomiting,10.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"July 18, 2020",9,"I have been taking Ativan for five years now for nausea and anxiety. Originally it was just for nausea.They gave me Zofran which worked but I couldn't take the side-effects and Compazine which didn't seem to do anything. When they gave me Ativan at 1mg taken three times per day as needed, my nausea went away and I was calm.The only thing is (and I'm sure it's the doctor's fault) I get 60 pills in one bottle to take 3 times per day. I'd run out of pills in 20 days! So I have to use them sparingly. I don't know how I made it through back when I was on the Cisplatin / Taxol combination. It helped tremendously but sometimes wore off a couple of hours early and I'd start vomiting. But with all the other chemo drugs it worked like a charm. I guess Cisplatin is just an extremely strong drug. Maybe if they gave me 2mg I'd have fared better.",Remington Steele
4,Lorazepam,NauseaVomiting,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"May 5, 2020",7,Ativan (lorazepam):Don't you believe it! I was admitted to hospital for colitis. They gave me every nausea medicine and it didn't work then gave me Ativan. It didn't work either. The only reason they gave it to me was by then they thought my complaint was psychosomatic and wanted to prove me a liar by showing  that Ativan stopped my symptoms so my complaints were not real only anxiety. Useless drug Ativan. Don't use it.,Anonymous
5,Lorazepam,NauseaVomiting,10.0,Taken for 5 to 10 years,"April 12, 2020",14,Use for anxiety and nausea. Works great for me.,Kathie
6,Lorazepam,NauseaVomiting,9.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"July 7, 2019",28,"I was prescribed lorazapam for anxiety, and while it works fine for that, I have found that it treats my undiagnosed nausea and dizzy spells the best! When the lightheadedness begins, I take one and 15 mins later I'm fine. Since it doesn't make me sleepy at all, I can go about my day no problem.",dizzyat35
7,Lorazepam,NauseaVomiting,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"June 14, 2019",19,"I was miserable with gastroparesis, then because I have several other conditions, my doc gave me Ativan. OMG it has practically eliminated gastroparesis! No nausea, no pain, I am still constipated but am successfully dealing with that!",Kath
8,Lorazepam,NauseaVomiting,10.0,Taken for 5 to 10 years,"May 14, 2019",10,SMAS (Superior Mesenteric Artery Syndrome) syndrome makes me vomit all the time but lorazepam helps me stop vomiting.... Its a miracle,Smas09
9,Lorazepam,NauseaVomiting,10.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"December 24, 2018",37,"Ativan (lorazepam):Ativan is a wonderful medicine.  The people that abuse it, are ruining it for everyone.  I got food poisoning followed by 3 rounds of what doctors called ""stomach flu.""  They couldn't figure out how to help me.  Ativan is the only thing that helped my nausea.  The stomach issues I had also caused me anxiety that I never had in my life before.  Ativan helped both nausea and anxiety with zero side effects.  Took Ativan for 6 weeks then switched to Klonopin to wean off.  Both of those meds are far better than any other SSRI which seem to have so many side effects.",blue-sky
10,Lorazepam,NauseaVomiting,10.0,Taken for 10 years or more,"September 12, 2018",28,Lorazepam Intensol (lorazepam):I’ve been using lorazepam for 22 years. I get a prescription of 60 pills 0.5 mg. at a time. I take around 10 pills per month and only when I absolutely need it. I use them for my fear of vomiting and the anxiety I get at times due to this fear. It has been a godsend for me. You cannot drink alcohol with this medicine. I have taken it hours after I’ve drank because alcohol gives me anxiety and nausea.,Minnie
11,Lorazepam,NauseaVomiting,2.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"March 2, 2017",17,"Ativan (lorazepam):This med. Was given as anti anxiety medication. Straight knocked me out an hour after taking. Girl friend took it. She some how functioned to go to work. I was completely unable to cut hair, even unable to get out of chair. Anxiety was gone. And u should only take this drug short term then wean off it.My girl friends Dr. doubled her dosage from 1mg to 2 mg and without it she completely freaked out, yelling, screaming at me. She completely changes her personality if without it. When she stopped taking it, it was like she was coming off heroine. Was a worse situation coming off it, Dr. Did not lower her dose slowly, nor gave her something that could help her come off it. Mixed with cymbalta? Even worse. Mass hallucinations, both bad drugs.",Ziggy marps
12,Lorazepam,NauseaVomiting,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"December 27, 2016",37,Ativan (lorazepam):Ativan helped with nausea tremendously.... I've been dealing with nausea for 8 months ...stress related ....,Miss thangggg
13,Lorazepam,NauseaVomiting,10.0,,"October 3, 2016",37,"I am going through chemo for recurring lymphoma. Naturally there is anxiety involved, lack of sleep, nausea and complete lack of appetite. I have a tumour on the trachea and difficulty breathing. In the hospital I received Ativan which so profoundley help with all of the above: anxiety, nausea and breathing. I am SO grateful for this medication, it made my life bearable. Ativan enhances the effects of the anti-nausea drug by far. And the anti-anxiety help me breath better. It soothes the racing thoughts at night and I can sleep. All this on 1mg at night, no more. This tiny under-the-tongue is a miracle for me.",Saritali
14,Lorazepam,NauseaVomiting,10.0,,"September 29, 2016",17,Severe motion sickness....nothing seemed to help. Meclizine and Zofran did OK but still nausea on a plane.Brought Lorazepam  into the mix with the other two and WOW just like sitting in my living room no symptoms at all.,Anonymous
15,Lorazepam,NauseaVomiting,10.0,Taken for 10 years or more,"May 13, 2016",36,Ativan (lorazepam):Have Gastroparesis.  Gag reflex problem. Helps smooth the large muscles.  Cannot tolerate side effects of Reglan.  Use with Zofran at times.,7527
16,Lorazepam,NauseaVomiting,9.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"April 14, 2016",22,I would like to share my experience with LORazepam - I have Breast Cancer which entailed a right side mastectomy and axillary node dissection (painful) where I am on Hyrdocod 10/300's for pain. I am on my 4th extensive Chemo where the first 5 days after Chemo every food smell causes severe nausea where I cannot eat - I just want to cover my nose. They had me on Compazine (really needs to be off the market at it is a useless drug - did not work during my pregnancies either that and phenergan) - they put me on Zofran - all this did was want to make me sleep with no relief relative to nausea.  After consulting with my Oncologist he placed me Lorazepan and would you not know as soon as I took - within 15 minutes the nausea feeling gone!,KassM
17,Lorazepam,NauseaVomiting,6.0,,"January 22, 2016",8,"It was interesting reading through the other opinions.  My experience with Ativan has not been great, I have severe headaches every time I have tried taking it.  In addition to having cancer I also have PTSD and chronic pain syndrome, so I have to take Cymbalta, hydrocodone and hydromorphone for breakthrough pain.  I recently added Xanax and it helps with anxiety, BUT I loose giant periods of memory.  I am a wife and mom of two teenagers and I can't stand thinking about all of the memories I am loosing every day.  Does anyone have a better suggestion for replacing both the Ativan AND Xanax?????",TK Villa
18,Lorazepam,NauseaVomiting,10.0,,"July 23, 2015",26,"I have tried Promethazine (Phenergan), Zofran (Odanestron), and Hydroxyzine (Atarax), and I can honestly say, all those medications DID work pretty good for me. Promethazine being the best, followed by Zofran, and then Hydroxyzine to list them in order. But once I tried Lorazepam (Ativan) it blew all the rest away! It's such a god send. I've always had stomach problems where in just a matter of minutes my stomach becomes SO nauseas it starts to hurt me so bad and I would get dehydraded and would need Medical assistance (ER) But not anymore, Ativan took that all away!",ATiVAN1mg
19,Lorazepam,NauseaVomiting,10.0,,"December 23, 2014",67,"Ativan (lorazepam):For post-chemo nausea, this works better than ondanestron (Zofran) for me.",LeniRose
20,Lorazepam,NauseaVomiting,5.0,,"November 4, 2014",24,I was on this med during chemo and it worked fine during the first 4 months. After that I started getting uncontrolable crying spells.  Would just burst into tears for no reason.  Found out this was one of the side effects.  Believe me I don't cry easily at least until I was on lorazepam.  Even went to a psychologist twice and even she wasn't sure why I was there since I don't have issues to work out.  Other than the crying problem I did like this med.  it worked well for me during the first 4 months of chemo.  Good luck!,Jlemaire
21,Lorazepam,NauseaVomiting,10.0,,"May 27, 2014",40,Lorazepam is the only one of the many medicines I've been given with my chemo that stops my stomach from feeling like someone is at it with a blow torch.I take it every night to help me sleep---1mg once or twice a day.I really need it the first 2 weeks after chemo.,Marie Theresa
22,Lorazepam,NauseaVomiting,10.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"November 6, 2013",68,"Ativan (lorazepam):Ativan is the only drug that can stop my vomiting when I'm in the middle of a bad cycle (I have cyclical vomiting syndrome which is triggered by neurally mediated hypotension.) I've never had any nasty side effects. I just get pleasantly loopy and very sleepy which is usually a blessing after staying up all night. I don't have a prescription for it so I end up in the ER a few times a year which is when they give it to me. (By the time it's that bad, I need IV fluids anyway so...)",Optiaine

26,Lorazepam,NauseaVomiting,10.0,,"March 18, 2012",65,"Ativan (lorazepam):This is amazing! It helps so many things. But the 3 main ones are nausea, insomnia and panic disorder. I also have fibromyalgia. I do try to keep the dosage as low as I can. I am prescribed a 1 mg pill 4 times a day. I take 2 of those at bedtime with a muscle relaxer and I sleep all the way through the night. I try to keep it to only 3 pills a day. I also take 60 mg of Cymbalta a day. Combined with the Ativan it keeps me and my husband sane. I also do yoga 2 to 3 times a week and walk. Exercise is a must with fibromyalgia.",Anonymous
27,Lorazepam,NauseaVomiting,10.0,,"March 17, 2012",94,Ativan (lorazepam):Lorazepam is the only thing that touches my nausea after having chemotherapy and for break-through nausea from the chemo.  I was not aware that this was a medicine used for nausea until my Dr. prescribed them for me and told me to dissolve them under my tongue for the nausea.  It almost always helps immediately and doesn't make me too drowsy to function. I just use 1mg. dosage and only when needed for the nausea and that is improving so I am very thankful.,Anonymous
