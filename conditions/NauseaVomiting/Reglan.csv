0,Reglan,NauseaVomiting,,Taken for less than 1 month,"March 9, 2022",0,"I went to the ER for non-stop vomiting & they gave me Reglan through the IV. I was already sitting in the room waiting to be treated for 3 hours so I was already annoyed but once they administer the Reglan & left me there for what would’ve been more hours, I felt like I was going insane. Never in my life have I felt so manic, I called my husband stuttering to him saying I’m gonna rip the IV out my arm! I have to get out of this hospital! So he told me to calm down & maybe someone would come check on me but a hour passed & I finally lost it & dialed the nurse to discharge me from the hospital asap. I felt so embarrassed & kept saying I don’t know why I feel like this but I was too restless & my anxiety was literally making me crazy. They never warned me of any side effects.",Nikki

Reglan was added after zofran and meclizine didn’t totally resolve symptoms. Same as others, I experienced the worst agitation of my life. Screaming, thrashing, begging them to knock me unconscious. It was horrific. They gave me Ativan and Benadryl, eventually I fell asleep. They said, Oh some people react this way. I can’t believe they continue to use a drug that does this.",never take this
2,Reglan,NauseaVomiting,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"February 21, 2022",3,"PLEASE do not take this medication!! If you go into the ER for nausea and vomiting and they tell you their going to administer this medication into your IV, tell them absolutely not! I suffered from Hyperthemsis Gravidarum for the first 3 months of my pregnancy that landed me in the ER five times and I had to be put on IV fluids the first couple times they gave me zofran which worked the first and second time and then it just started making my nausea and vomiting worse. The next couple times I came into the ER and I told them the zofran was making me feel worse they decided to give me Reglan and oh my god I had never felt this way from a medication before after ten mins of them giving it to me I started shaking and feeling the worse anxiety I've ever felt and I have anxiety disorder. I wanted to rip my IV out of my arm and run out of the hospital. I remember I started looking at my IV and trying to figure out a way I could remove it myself without injuring myself.",Anonymous

4,Reglan,NauseaVomiting,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"January 9, 2022",1,"Just like many others have said, I was given this in the ER for nausea and vomiting. TERRIBLE!!!! Do NOT let a doctor give you this medicine!!!! It makes you feel mentally insane and violently ill! Your entire body shakes, intense muscle cramping and contortions, nerve pain, panic attacks, have the urge to rip out the IV and escape the hospital bed, dizzy, confusion, uncontrollable body movements. Like many others have said as well, this medication can truly be PTSD inducing, especially if you have history of anxiety/depression. I thought I was insane until I saw the amount of people with the same bizarre side effects. And it didn't even touch my nausea or vomiting issue in the slightest! Can't believe this medication is even used still in ER or hospital settings. Stick to safe nausea medications like Zofran (ondansetron). The only one I trust, even if it doesn't always work. At least it won't drive you to insanity.",Carly
5,Reglan,NauseaVomiting,3.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"December 31, 2021",0,"I took this drug to combat hyperemesis . Very severe vomiting and nausea during my second pregnancy. My doctors refused to give me anything to treat hyperemesis during my first pregnancy and they may have been right.  I had such severe  nausea and vomiting that I was sick all day every day and vomited at minimum 10x a day . So whenI went to the ER and was given IV fluids , Zofran and a prescription for Reglan I thought it was a cure . Little did I know the toll it would take on my mental health, racing thoughts . I tried stopping Reglan one month after beginning it and was okay for a few days but the nausea came back with a vengeance . I started back taking it but just couldn’t shake the feeling of being unwell and depression. So I finally stopped taking it after about 4 months on the medication. It’s only been a few days but I’m depressed and still not feeling 100 percent. There is no winning if I don’t eat I hurt my baby and if I take this medicine I have another hurt",Anonymous

7,Reglan,NauseaVomiting,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"November 3, 2021",1,I was given this in my IV while admitted for severe dehydration. Within 5 minutes I had a full blown panic attack that Xanax couldn't even touch. They did not tell me any of the side effects I have now read up on after that experience. I had to be discharged against medical advice because the attack was so severe I was going crazy in the room. I tried to rip my IV out from it bothering me so badly after that and they luckily came and took it out. It all started with the IV making me feel insane. My whole arm that it was administered in felt like I wanted it gone from my body that it was some foreign object touching me. I will never take this medicine again. I couldn't tell you if it helped the nausea or not because I ended up throwing up from the panic attack.,Rae

Worse reaction of my life. I jumped up and started passing out to the floor, felt like I needed to crawl out of my skin. My heart rate was tachycardia. It was worse than the nausea and it didn't help. I did get it through an IV with benadryl because they said it makes people want to crawl out of their skin. No worth it even with severe nausea.",Stepjac

Although Benadryl was part of the infusion I still had horrible symptoms. First I started to hallucinate. Then fell asleep began having nightmares of suffocation. Nurse woke me and I still couldn’t orient myself and just kept saying help me  over and over my whole body jerking and arms especially spastic . I couldn’t stay awake and kept falling back then immediately waking with my whole body jerking and my arms and legs flailing around so bad I couldn’t use the call button or even pick it up. They sent me home that way.  It lasted about 4 hours. I was flailing so hard my husband could hardly get me into the car.

10,Reglan,NauseaVomiting,9.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"July 19, 2021",1,"I went to urgent care because my nausea has been unmanageable. I don’t throw up all day like I did with my first born, but the nausea makes it impossible to really eat or even take sips of water. I threw up my water yesterday and it was the final straw, sending me to UC. The doctor ordered 2L of NS and a reglan push. I too felt like taking the IV out of my arm, but I was also uncomfortable and shaking because, of course, the NS doesn’t feel so comfortable entering your body. I felt pretty ill for 15 minutes, then I knocked out. Honestly, after I felt way better. The nausea was non existent and I actually had an appetite where I was craving foods again. I didn’t want to take reglan, but I’ve tried all the tips and tricks one can do. I do not want to take it again, just because I don’t like taking medication during pregnancy, but it really helped. Today I’m back to barely having any appetite, for both food and water.",Lex

I was desperate, throwing up 3-8 times daily and feeling sick all day. Couldn’t eat, couldn’t sleep etc. It was an absolute nightmare. I was finally given this medicine after trying some b-6 and antihistamines which btw did absolutely nothing for me. All I can say is wow. It gave me a semblance of a life again. My sickness is not ALL the way gone but it’s extremely manageable. I would recommend this for hy. Anyone that has ever had hyperemesis  knows how much of a nightmare it is.

Within minutes, I started having a psychiatric break.  I had never experienced anything like it.  My body wanted to rip out my IV and run from the hospital.  My hands were shaking, and I couldn’t focus well enough to even make a phone call.  My brain knew I was out of control, but it couldn’t stop the reaction.  I felt completely helpless.  I tried to explain how I felt to the doctor, and he threatened to send me to the psych ward.  One of the nurses finally suggested I might be having an allergic reaction.

Went to the ER for stomach pain, and was administered Reglan and Morphine.  Only thing I remember is feeling like I wanted to rip my skin off, and had no awareness of what was even happening.  I remember telling the doctors and nurse drain my blood.  Get this out of me.  Sounds dramatic and crazy, because it really was.  How I recall them telling me it was a bad reaction to this medicine I’m not sure... just remember looking at my dad as they held me down and sedated me with benadryl.  I’ve never in my life experienced so scary.  Literally have PTSD, and scared to take any meds because of this drug.  The most uncomfortable I’ve ever been in my life.",Jae

I had a bad reaction to the opioid I was given, and the Zofran I was on wasn't doing anything. My doctor decided to give me Reglan. This drug made the worst night of my life a touch more awful. Within minutes of it going in my IV I had this overwhelming feeling that I needed to get out of the hospital. It was not logical - I was really sick. I just couldn't control my thoughts. I started screaming ""I have to get out of here! let me out! get me out of here"" over and over like a maniac. Then the hot flashes came. I was shaking like a leaf and feeling like I was crawling in my skin. I started stripping my clothes off. If I could have taken my skin off too I would've. By far the strangest reaction I've ever had to a drug. This stuff is awful. Luckily the nurses came running in with Benadryl. That calmed me down pretty quickly.

Throwing up almost every meal and I was severely dehydrated. My ob friend recommended unisom 25 mg nightly and b6 25 mg 3x a day but it did not work. If anything I just threw it up after I took it. She then prescribed me reglan. Good heavens it definitely has been god send. I’ve taken two doses the past two days now and I have not thrown up.

I even tried vitamin combos with Unisom by my Dr. but nothing worked until I was told to take Reglan. I take it 4 times a day with 25mg of B6 and then 1/2 a unisom a night. I still have food adversities (like can’t stand the smell of coffee or onions) but I can eat mostly normal (which is great as I was loosing weight and already on the small side). I would give 10/10 except it makes me sleepy. I’ve found other caffeine (verb bars) which help but still always feel like I need a nap. Still SO MUCH BETTER than how sick and miserable I was feeling and sleepiness can also possibly a result of pregnancy cause that first trimester is always hard.",PregoAgain

26,Reglan,NauseaVomiting,2.0,,"May 8, 2020",32,"Within minutes of being given the Reglan I had sweltering hot feeling come over me. I began to panic and become restless. The more I watched the clock slowly tick by and tried not to focus on the impending doom feeling the worse it got. I wanted to rip the IV out of my arm. Between the anxiety, wanting to run for the hills, and my pounding heart in my chest it was a miracle I didn’t scream bloody murder. This went on for a good 30 minutes before the feeling subsided and I passed out. Although the medicine made me extremely anxious, it did knock down the nausea. I hope this validates any concerns and past experiences. I do not have a history of psych, but with this medication I don’t believe there requires to be one to make you feel this way. Please do not let a doctor try to tell you that benadryl will make it better and cancel out the anxiety feeling or that you can breathe through it. Trust your instincts and self advocate!

Make sure they have an order for Benadryl to use in case you have these side effects. And make sure the nurse pushes it very slow if administering through an IV.,Gerbee

I got so worried I  called my mom and told her my body is so agitated and I cant stop moving. If I called the doctor in I wouldn't even be able to talk for him to understand because this felt HORRIBLE and like I was being tortured. Avoid this drug please. These comments are real!,Sis
44,Reglan,NauseaVomiting,9.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"July 10, 2019",13,"I'm sad for all those people that Reglan put through the wringer, because it's been a miracle medicine for me. I used Zofran until my third delivery, when I had a reaction to it--body going numb, felt like I couldn't breathe or move. I've avoided it since. After that they prescribed Reglan, originally at 10 mg, but then the nurse adjusted it to only 5 mg. I should point out, I never took it multiple times a day every day, just when I would feel nauseous and then I'd be able to eat half an hour later if needed. Well, to make a long story short, I've gotten the stomach bug twice since then, and after throwing up a few times I took 5-10mg of Reglan just once and I stopped throwing up. I took it again later as needed for nausea, which usually didn't last long. This is a HUGE deal because I'm the sort of vomiter whose body won't stop and will dry heave itself into dehydration. This medicine has really helped me with vomiting and nausea, and I have experienced no side effects.",Swat095

Yesterday, I was in the hospital due to a Crohn’s flare up. Due to negligence, I was given a drug I’m extremely allergic to calledReglan. It induced a Parkinsonism reaction (akin to Parkinson’s disease) where I started violently seizing and convulsing. For 30 minutes, I lost motor control of my eyes, legs, arms, and mouth. The only thing voluntary movement I could do was move my eyes side to side. Benadryl counteracted the effects, but for 30 minutes, I thought I was going to die. And I bite off part of my tongue. And in those moments, I realized that some people live their whole lives like that. Paralyzed. So at the end of the day when you’re feeling upset over little things just realize it can be much worse.

I ended up in the ER a couple more times after that. Fast forward to three days ago, I was given Compazine for vomiting. I had no idea the two are closely related, and I experienced similar side effects. On the drive home I had to talk myself out of jumping out the car. Very deep thoughts consumed me. I do have a history of anxiety and depression so I'm not sure if there is a correlation or not, but I've never had a voice in my head trying to convince me to take my own life.

I thought I went crazy and had suicidal thoughts. I was depressed for a month after that. I couldn't tell you if it worked because I was too busy arguing with myself on whether I was crazy. I am one of those people who never thought suicide was an answer to anything, but this medicine made me believe it was the only answer. ",Neveragain

It made me uncontrollably agitated and nervous. I couldn't stop moving, I couldn't think clearly, and I couldn't relax until I was given a sedative.
