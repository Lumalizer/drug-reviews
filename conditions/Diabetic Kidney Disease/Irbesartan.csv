Had every heart check you can have and my heart is good but blood pressure was up a bit and they are using it to support my kidney as I have type two diabetes. not sure if it's working though. been on it for about 9 months.,Anonymous
1,Irbesartan,Diabetic Kidney Disease,9,,"January 24, 2011",51,"Avapro (irbesartan):I've been taking Avapro to prevent diabetic kidney disease, as I only have half of one kidney left after two bouts of kidney cancer.  So far, so good.  The Avapro has lowered my blood pressure also - sometimes goes a little too low, which is when I feel tired.  Other than that I have no noticeable side effects.  However, my doctor will have to find some other medication to protect my remaining partial kidney because my insurance company won't pay for Avapro anymore - even though my doctor says nothing else works as well.
