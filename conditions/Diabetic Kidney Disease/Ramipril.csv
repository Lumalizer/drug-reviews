1,Ramipril,Diabetic Kidney Disease,2,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"December 11, 2017",35,"I was initially prescribed ramipril for renal protective purposes due to high proteinuria.  I started at 5 mg and was gradually increased to 30mg over a 2 year period. Side effects: sleeplessness, irritable, panic attacks, overwhelm, inability to cope with everyday life, crying, loss of confidence, unable to complete projects... I thought is circumstantial, so over 6 month period quit my jobs and focused to reduce and manage stressors in life. But no improvement!?! The only thing left to remove/try was the drug. I went off it for 12 days and felt like million bucks! Calm, happy disposition, sleep, I was myself again! But bp went up to 189/116.  Hope there is another option for me :(",kayakgurl

3,Ramipril,Diabetic Kidney Disease,9,,"November 6, 2009",39,"I have type 1 diabetes as well, I was put on this medication about 3 months ago. My blood pressure was 127/80 which isn't bad but because of my diabetes it was suggested. So far its lowered my blood pressure and I have had no side effects using the pills and it worked within a month.",Bee Man
4,Ramipril,Diabetic Kidney Disease,10,,"October 3, 2009",76,"Altace (ramipril):I'm a Type I diabetic with normal blood pressure and I take Altace as a preventative treatment for kidney disease. Side effects have not been an issue and I'm pleased with this medication. More diabetics need to be proactive and encourage their physicians to add ACE Inhibitors and statins to their treatment regime. I'm not just a diabetic, I'm also a scientist.",Anonymous
