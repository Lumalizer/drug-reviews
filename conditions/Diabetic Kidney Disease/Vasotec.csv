0,Vasotec,Diabetic Kidney Disease,1,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"October 30, 2018",3,10/30/2018:    I am insulin dependent Type 1 diabetic who takes enalapril 5mg to control Kidney Microprotenuria.  Recently I changed to Vasotec 5mg cause Teva Enalapril 5mg no longer being carried at my local Walgreens.   Horrific adverse reactions causing my insulin not to work in my body & causing high levels of glucose.  The VAsotec 5mg seems to be acting like a Beta Blocker which raises sugar and prevents insulin from working.    While Enalapril Ace Inhibitors tend to help lower sugar levels & helps insulin work well.  I traced Vasotec 5mg manufacturer to Oceanside Pharma located in Puerto Rico which is a subsidiary of Valeant Pharma who recently changed their name to Bausch Pharma .  I suspect that there might be something dangerously wrong in the mftg process of Vasotec pill in Puerto Rico.   ,MimiM1
