0,Bumetanide,Edema,6,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"August 30, 2021",0,Bumex (bumetanide):Absolutely an awful drug. Yes it reduced the edema but caused serious cramping and muscle spasms in both legs and feet! Caused a serious hypokalemia problem. Makes it impossible to sleep at night due to the spams and cramping.,Mike
1,Bumetanide,Edema,1,Taken for less than 1 month,"December 10, 2020",4,"Tried bumetanide for 15 days,  edema got worst, 5 Kg weight gain and edema increased from ankle to up to knees. Worst of all edema never decreased up to ankles even after losing weight. So negative effective -10.",2ErrIsPatient
2,Bumetanide,Edema,8,,"December 1, 2020",4,"Bumex (bumetanide):At first I was sick for 2 days.  I was very dizzy, nauseous and unsteady on my feet.  I had to take a day sick leave. I couldn't believe the amount of water I had.  Usually I don't go to the loo that often but on the first day after taking the pill, I couldn't believe that I was actually going to the loo so often and for so long.  My swollen feet and ankles went down to normal.  Afterwards it really did become normal again,  I was so chuffed.  I do get dizzy at times but I have low blood pressure so I think its caused by that.  My Doctor said I can't be on this tablet too long.  He only gave me one month's supply.  I dread thinking that I have to go off it again because I left it for 2 days to try and prolong the time I can use it.  Big mistake!  My feet and ankles were so swollen again.  It felt as if they could burst.  I also felt sick again so I don't know if there is something else I could try.",Bibi
3,Bumetanide,Edema,9,Taken for less than 1 month,"October 21, 2020",1,"Was started on Bumex 1 mg after awful reaction to Lasix 20 mg.  The Bumex 1 mg certainly works!  I must be near a bathroom all morning, until at least 1:00 pm.  It is ruining my social and intimate life big time. Works, but almost too well.  At the end of the day my kidneys and bladder feel beat up.",Anna
4,Bumetanide,Edema,10,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"January 18, 2020",11,Bumex (bumetanide):Works right away.   Been taking 2mg for years.   Better than other water pills.,Me
5,Bumetanide,Edema,9,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"November 21, 2019",10,Bumex (bumetanide):Bumex worked great. Took down the swelling of my ankles after Furosemide stopped working. Only problem is that it's very hard on the kidneys especially with a kidney transplant.,Macass
6,Bumetanide,Edema,10,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"February 1, 2018",20,Bumex (bumetanide):I got put on Bumex after Lasix stopped working. Bumex is reliable. It works with or without drinking a bunch of water. And the max daily dose is ten 1 mg doses so there is lots of room to increase it for a day if you need to.,ithinktoomuch
7,Bumetanide,Edema,9,Taken for 5 to 10 years,"November 12, 2017",4,Now aged 88 used for nearly ten years gradually increasing from 1mg to higher doses. No side effects. Now using dialysis plus Bumetanide for best control of ankle swelling. Best of course is to start with CardioRetinometry monitoring of vitamin C needs to avoid kidney failure due to blocked arteries. I learned too late after damage had started and an unusually swollen prostate didnÂ´t help.,Sydney Bush (UK - NHS)
8,Bumetanide,Edema,10,,"May 29, 2016",13,This work very well however I think my Doctor at my next appointment will have to increase the dosage a little. I take 1mg in morning and another 1 mg in afternoon. I think an additional .5mg will do the trick because my feet and ankles still swell by mid afternoon. What I like about this medication is that I have a mild allergy to sulfonamides so I can't take Lasix. Because this drug is fast acting and leaves the system within two hours I have no problem with it. I was taking another but the medication cost $1000. per month and my Prescription Drug Plan would no longer cover it. Apparently Bumetanide is the only other drug out there that will not cause a reaction in me. Thank God.,WillNier
9,Bumetanide,Edema,2,Taken for 10 years or more,"December 11, 2015",10,"I only took them for 3 days because my legs legs went in such funny shapes but I was given these instead of furosemide  which any good either but I take such a lot if medication I think one works against the other, but I never see the same doctor twice one gave me forusemide with potassium  the next one took the potassium off me. And what can I do. I'm 70 and have taken water tablets for about 25 years  and still can't wear shoes.  I have to wear slippers to go out in .",Sandy Brettle
10,Bumetanide,Edema,10,,"July 1, 2015",40,"Bumex (bumetanide):I had whole body swelling, caused by retaining water. I didn't have ankles, I had cankles, lol. I tried lasix, and 2 weeks later, It was down a little.Ankles still swollen just as much, but hands were going back to normal. Upon going to my check up, my doctor decided to try Bumex 2mg. Within 1 week, I was back to normal. The only problem I had with these pills is they're large and sometimes get stuck in my throat.",lincolnlady73
11,Bumetanide,Edema,7,,"July 16, 2008",90,Bumex (bumetanide):This pill was miracle one for me.  I helps me so much with the retained fluid in my body.,Anonymous
