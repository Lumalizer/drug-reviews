1,Spironolactone,Edema,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"February 16, 2021",3,"I have been using Spironolactone for two weeks.  It worked for the first week then stopped working.  My ankles are swollen seemingly permanently, a condition I find intolerable if not time for court to sue my doctor.I never had swollen ankles before I took amlopidine - another house medicine that should be taken off the market.",Anonymous

The latter caused unsightly leg edema.Nine days ago the chlorthalidone was replaced by spironolactone, and potassium supplements were stopped. My BP remains OK, and since the change, the edema has decreased noticeably.",aremkay
3,Spironolactone,Edema,1.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"August 12, 2018",16,"Drug was initiated in combination with Furosemide while hospitalized for liver disease with ascites. Was told this was the gold standard treatment for this.  Result was fluid shifts, electrolyte imbalance, impaired kidneys and severe muscle cramping.  Nine months off this drug and the reduced kidney function and high potassium levels persist.  For some people the potassium sparing does not stop when the drug is discontinued.  There is no antidote for it.",BLW
4,Spironolactone,Edema,4.0,,"February 21, 2018",9,"I'm a 64 year old Male, I'm 6'1"" and weigh 297lb. I am borderline Diabetic, and had Asthma my whole life. I have been on Spironolactone 50Mg (1 a Day) for over six years. At first it seemed to work as it lowered my BP and helped with my swollen ankles and feet. I noticed that Spironolactone improved my Breathing some after taking for about a month. I now have a red welt or blister on my left shin near my ankle. Its been there for almost a year. My blood pressure is still good due to Losartin, but my ankles are now always swollen and my breathing is back to the way it was, so-so. I have read terrible reviews about this drug on this web sites as in premature Deaths caused by long time use of Spironolactone, plus Serious levels of high Potassium that required Hospitalization. I am currently taking (all Generic) Lipitor, Losartin, Spironolactone, Theophylline, Singular, Xopenex and Combivent inhalers. I also take Lexapro for depression.",RickJ1941

6,Spironolactone,Edema,10.0,,"April 8, 2017",17,"I am a 43-year-old healthy female. No diabetes, no high cholesterol  and not on any other medications. I had to start taking spiro because of edema. My legs and feet were were so puffy I could barely wear shoes.  I've been on spiro for a week now.  I lost 6 pounds of water in the first three days of taking it. My legs and feet are still puffy so progress is gradual.  I also elevate my legs whenever I can.  I've never used another diuretic other than this one so I can't compare it.   My doctor prescribed it for two weeks only, I take it in the morning with my breakfast and have not experienced any side effects at all except mild thirst in the mornings upon waking up.",Auntie Moe

11,Spironolactone,Edema,9.0,,"July 25, 2009",35,"Love this medicine. Works wonders, it even has kept my blood sugars lower than usual (I'm a type 1 diabetic) BUT it WILL decrease your blood pressures so if you have normal blood pressure be very careful, if you overdose you could faint from low blood pressure. I take 50 milligrams 4 days before my period, sometimes earlier.",Rebi
