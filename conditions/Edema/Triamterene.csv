0,Triamterene,Edema,9,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"September 9, 2020",6,"I've been taking Triamterene 37.5mg for 3 years for treatment of edema which is so bad my leg breaks open.  It's been so bad that I had a huge wound on the back of my left leg that wouldn't heal for nearly a year.  The triamterene has elevated my liver enzymes slightly above normal, but other than that, I have had no side effects.  In the time I've taken it, I've gone as many as 3 days without taking it, and my body sure does feel it, because my ankles and feet will swell up huge, but as soon as I'm back on it for a couple days, the swelling disappears.",Ela
1,Triamterene,Edema,7,,"June 19, 2015",15,"It works well for my swollen legs, but since I've started taking it, I have extreme itching all over my body!  Unbearable!  Also, have very painful leg cramps, occasionally, at night.",SandySurface

3,Triamterene,Edema,8,,"March 26, 2014",21,"Dyrenium (triamterene):I've been suffering from extreme edema since 2009. I've been on a different diuretics since then and have used in a combination Lasix &  potassium and it has to help regulate the fluid retention. without the Dyrenium, my potassium levels drop to almost lethal level. Obviously this is an improvement! Side effects are not overtly noticeable due to the use of them with Lasix: Usual dry mouth, cramping of back & legs, weakness.  I would rate it higher but it is very expensive.",racyred803
4,Triamterene,Edema,1,,"May 11, 2010",58,"If you take triamterene and have leg pain consider it could be the medicine. My mother took it and had severe leg pain, shooting down from the hip. As she has arthritis doctors said it was arthritis and it got so bad she considered having hip replacement surgery. I saw that it got worse when she took the medicine. She asked the doctor to give her another medicine for the blood pressure and after a week the pain was gone completely - no need for surgery. The medicine helped the blood pressure but the pain in her leg was too much, as she could hardly walk. If you are taking the medicine and have leg pain shooting down the leg talk to your doctor about getting another medicine. ",empirelady
