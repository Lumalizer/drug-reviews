0,Hydrochlorothiazide,Edema,4.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"December 27, 2021",0,I have high blood pressure and edema.

1,Hydrochlorothiazide,Edema,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"August 2, 2021",1,"I had taken bp meds for 30 years including chlorothiazide....but was having difficulty getting it, so the NP changed my prescription to hydrochlorothiazide (25 mg). The first time I took it, my heart rate went from 67 to 115....but back down again after 2 hours. I kept having minor problems taking it, but on the 7th day, my heart rate went to 150 and stayed there for 6 hours. I took myself off of the medicine and my heart rate dropped back to 67-74 range.  My NP said that lots of people take the medicine and that was not a normal reaction....no kidding, but I will never take this again.",cricket
2,Hydrochlorothiazide,Edema,1.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"May 11, 2021",2,I have been taking 50 mg hctz for a month and it hasn't helped my edema at all.,Lulu
3,Hydrochlorothiazide,Edema,9.0,,"August 22, 2020",15,"Started taking 25 mg of Hydrochlorothiazide a couple days ago and I'm not sure if I should be on it or not. My heart was damaged about 7 years ago and I'm taking Metaprolol Suscinate 100 mg for that, but I've had some serious water retention. I've been on the water pill for about 3 days now, and the last 2 I've had heart palpitations. Bad ones too. like a beat skipped every 5-25 beats and it's lasted for over 2 hours. The thing is, I took the water pill at around 6 am and I didn't have any issues all day. It wasn't until around 11 pm the palpitations started. Since the water pill has a half life of 6-15 hours, I shouldn't be having any effects that I didn't have earlier when it was at full strength, right?Not sure what to do, but it's been great at reducing the water retention, so I'm at a loss here.",Emperor Palpitates
4,Hydrochlorothiazide,Edema,8.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"November 20, 2019",37,I actually started off taking Lasix which increased urination but I didn't see much improvement with the swelling in my ankles and feet. Then I tried this medication and the swelling improved greatly within the first 24 hours! I can see the bones in my ankles again.. I'd forgotten what they looked like! Not sure why this worked when Lasix didn't but I'm thrilled with the results.,Lily

6,Hydrochlorothiazide,Edema,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"October 1, 2019",26,I took hydrochlorothiazide 12.5mg for swollen ankles in my late 20s. I ended up in the ER with a HR of 130 and BP of 170/120. I took it one other time just to see if it was the med and it was!! Horrible chest palpitating and anxiety with them. No one can tell me why this med had opposite effects. All I can think is possibly wasting of too much potassium?,KB
7,Hydrochlorothiazide,Edema,10.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"July 31, 2019",27,Doctor added 50mg  hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) daily to the 80mg furosemide I have been taking due to swelling and water retention caused by CHF. Seems to have helped some with leg swelling and breast tenderness plus BP has dropped to an average of 128/72.,Danielle43
8,Hydrochlorothiazide,Edema,,Taken for less than 1 month,"February 10, 2019",38,"I am on my third day of treatment with this drug for high blood pressure and edema in my legs, not associated with any other drug side effects, doctors diagnosis is that my heart is not getting rid of enough fluid, I noticed the first day that I took this drug that it is working real well, although it makes you urinate more and more frequently, I admit I feel lighter in my legs but are still a little swollen, no side effects from this drug so far.",angel
9,Hydrochlorothiazide,Edema,9.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"August 31, 2018",28,My doctor added a 50mg dose to the 80mg dose of lasix I was taking. After about a week I noticed a big difference in my leg swelling without any additional side effects. Blood pressure is down slightly to 115/65.,LIsa

11,Hydrochlorothiazide,Edema,1.0,,"August 15, 2016",30,This drug isn't worth a nickel! Its made my swelling worse,Kit kay
12,Hydrochlorothiazide,Edema,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"October 4, 2014",47,"Well! You would not think to get such a thing at the age of 36, But it is me you know? And anything annoying like that usually has to bite me in the rear. But this medicine gave noticeable results a couple of days later. I can now see the knots on my ankles again! And I no longer have legs like John Goodman. So I suppose this means my kidneys are not up to snuff then.",Abbie Hoffman
13,Hydrochlorothiazide,Edema,8.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"March 12, 2013",90,"I was given this for edema caused from side effect of meds and side effects of my disease, Sarcoidosis.  It was used to alleviate the edema and help flush calcium from my kidneys.  I lost 8 lbs the first 3 days on the lowest dosage and I was staying well hydrated.  The edema was so bad it was affecting my Blood Pressure (150/110) even though it was only mildly noticeable. Within 3 days I noticed fluid from my legs, back and even chest were gone....didn't even know it was anywhere but my legs.  I did notice a mild nagging headache but not sure if it was due to meds or seasonal allergies.  Since med could make me tired, I was cautious taking Benedryl (only safe allergy medicine I can take) since I also took Xanax and Percocet.  However, I feel energized.",lissad1980
14,Hydrochlorothiazide,Edema,7.0,,"December 9, 2010",55,"I lost a lot of water weight in the first few days, but my edema did not improve. I ended up having to combine it with Lasix. The cocktail of diuretics controlled my edema, and I have not had another flare up in a year. The combination took a few months to get it under control, but I did start to see the swelling go down within the first week or two. The negative was that I had to take mag-ox and potassium pills that were horrible to swallow and the mag-ox gave me headaches for about the first month.",Leslie29
15,Hydrochlorothiazide,Edema,9.0,,"January 15, 2010",71,I had noticeable results within 24 hours. I had gained a lot of edema from Lyrica. This drug helped reverse that with little discomfort or side effects. I had increased pulse at first and a little dizziness but it went away quickly.,Kahleia
