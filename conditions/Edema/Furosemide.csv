I thought it may have been connected to a full body massage I'd gotten 2 days before that but, at this point, it seems it's not. I'm still having this issue 3.5 weeks later, but now the edema is pitting.  I saw my Dr 2 days ago & she pointed out that my calves are also swollen. She prescribed this med for me to take twice a day for three days. She's also sending me for an echocardiogram. So far, I've taken one dose & it maybe the last one I take. I've got the absolute worst optical/sinus headache. I've taken my rx migraine med, rx ibuprofen & 2 OTC sinus pills with no luck. I'm aware headaches are a possible side effect but I didn't expect it to be this bad. As expected, I'm peeing a lot, but the negatives are outweighing the positives.",Jillyn31

2,Furosemide,Edema,10.0,Taken for 10 years or more,"October 16, 2021",0,"I have CHF and unfortunately, edema comes with the territory. Thankful to have Lasix (furosemide), what I call my ""miracle drug"".  Yes, Lasix has many side effects, but it has saved my life on more than one occasion, both at home and during hospitalization.  In the past, I have had home emergencies where my fluid retention was out control and I was short of breath and had to double my Lasix dosage and within an hour or less, I was breathing normally.  My cardiologist started me on 40 mgs of Lasix once a day, than 20 mgs, and I'm presently on 40 mgs twice daily.  In the past, I have been on the VENTILATOR 3 times due to fluid retention around my heart and in my lungs. I can say without a doubt that my ""miracle drug"" Lasix, is one of the reasons I was able to survive for close to 20 years with CHF.  Pray for a CHF cure. God Bless Everyone.",Yes!

When I told my PA that the medication was not working she said that a higher dose ""would make your kidneys lazy"". Comments such as this is WHY I insist on my husband coming in for every doctor visit. This swelling IS extremely painful and has cost me far too many days of my life. THIS added to a rotten spine (and multiple surgeries) has stolen TIME, time that is not sitting around awaiting redos.  Need something BETTER than the lasix.",kroyval

During the first few times of extreme swelling I had already been prescribed furosemide, which is suppose to help with fluid retention. Unfortunately that was not my experience while dealing with a severe case of pitted edema. I found the furosemide did absolutely nothing, & I mean NOTHING!! I was taking 80 mg twice a day and at times could not urinate at all. After retaining 100 extra lbs. of fluid in a 6 wks span, I was forced to go to the ER. I spent 22 days in the IMU unit with 4 IVâ€™s pumping 4 different diuretics.

X 2 for 6mo.s (damn I was patient) for the swelling in my feet.  I was weeing a lot but it didn't hardly reduce the swelling.  I've also noticed a significant increase in the cravings for potassium laden food so I believe it HAS drained me of that!Will try to get Doc to increase it to 40mg all at once as other reviewers have stated that 20mg is not enough... and it sure hasn't been for me.,tinman

I was prescribed Furosemide 20mg & Potassium Chloride CRYS ER 10 TBCR. I've lost the 18 lbs over 4 days but it gave me a really bad bladder infection with fever.

Might work a little, however, the problem is that 2 x a day of 20 mg Lasix does not mean you have a dose of 40 mg Lasix--you just have 2, 20 mg doses.

My legs were rock hard in the evenings, severe pitting, skin on fire and full of a tingling, rushing feeling. None of that tonight, but edema and pitting are still present.

28,Furosemide,Edema,2.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"February 1, 2018",56,"I was fine on furosemide for a year before it stopped working well. They upped the dose. Worked a little, then stopped again. They put me on a rescue diuretic. Metolazone spiked my creatinine, so they took that away but never changed my Lasix. Finally I was left with the choice of an ER visit or a sauna at my gym. That started a months-long period where I was taking 4 to 8 pounds of water off in the sauna every day to deal with my crappy response to Lasix. And that was sending my blood pressure down into 70's/40's. My cardiologist then referred me to a transplant team, who switched me to bumetanide on the first visit and told me to quit the sauna. Thanks to having a diuretic that actually works though, I don't need the sauna. Lasix is well known for becoming ineffective, and cardiologists are well known to let you suffer for MONTHS and even visits to the ER without changing it out for something that works. Don't let them do this to you. DEMAND a switch and don't give them an option.",ithinktoomuch

Have been taking Furosemide 40mg 1x day for over a year now - it is the only thing that keeps me from being in the hospital all the time with infections that require IV antibiotics. The only side effects I've noticed are the very frequent urination (not really a side effect, it's what the drug is *supposed* to do, as it flushes fluids out of the body), and aching in my legs and feet as the fluid leaves - I can only assume that is caused by my body trying to push the fluid out.",Anonymous

I only have one kidney and have hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.  I take 80 mg in the morning.  It does not always take all the swelling out, but if I miss just one dose, I can tell it by the afternoon.  Of course, if I take it in the afternoon, I'm up all night.  NOTE: There IS a difference in taking the Lasix as opposed to the generic furosemide.  For me, the generic is absolutely useless.  My mother had the same problem, so maybe it's genetic.  I've taken as much as 200 mg of generic at one time with no effect whatsoever.  I've noticed no side effects from the Lasix.",Anonymous

I to have felt the side effects of the side aches and leg discomfort. BUt have come to find out I also suffered from RLS ( restless leg syndrome). I do suffer from very minor headaches. But when one day you are swollen as a balloon and about 2 to 3 days later your are unswollen.  I first started out on 10 mg as needed, then had to go up to 20mg when required, then daily. Then eventually kept raising it by 20 after that to 40mg daily. Then I ended up having to take 2 x 40 mg daily, 2 x a day.  I also have insulin resistance/metabolic syndrome so that may have something to do with it. I'm now at 80mg daily.",ksop

65,Furosemide,Edema,10.0,,"October 16, 2009",39,"I am 62 and never had any problem with pedal edema until I began having to take medications for 'severe restless leg syndrome' and my meralgia paresthetica. Suddenly I was experiencing such edema problems that not only were my ankles drastically swollen but the edema moved upward to involve my entire calf area bilaterally. After just one day taking furosemide there was almost no edema at all - and that was on just 40 mg. I am sure the furosemide is responsible for controlling the edema because if I miss even one day, the drastic ankle and calf edema returns.This is one GREAT medicine.",DaddyRob1

I called the hospital where my doctor practices and the nurse practitioner from her office called me back.  She advised me not to take the Lasix anymore and to go to the ER if the cramping came back tonight.  My ankle is nearly normal size, but I am not sure it was worth it.",skinny ankle

Sometimes the side effects are a bigger problem then the original problem you were trying to treat. This was true in my case with Furosemide where the blurred vision, loud ringing in the ears and a bright red flaky face rash was unbearable.
