0,Bumex,Edema,6,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"August 30, 2021",0,Absolutely an awful drug. Yes it reduced the edema but caused serious cramping and muscle spasms in both legs and feet! Caused a serious hypokalemia problem. Makes it impossible to sleep at night due to the spams and cramping.,Mike
1,Bumex,Edema,8,,"December 1, 2020",4,"At first I was sick for 2 days.  I was very dizzy, nauseous and unsteady on my feet.  I had to take a day sick leave. I couldn't believe the amount of water I had.  Usually I don't go to the loo that often but on the first day after taking the pill, I couldn't believe that I was actually going to the loo so often and for so long.  My swollen feet and ankles went down to normal.  Afterwards it really did become normal again,  I was so chuffed.  I do get dizzy at times but I have low blood pressure so I think its caused by that.  My Doctor said I can't be on this tablet too long.  He only gave me one month's supply.  I dread thinking that I have to go off it again because I left it for 2 days to try and prolong the time I can use it.  Big mistake!  My feet and ankles were so swollen again.  It felt as if they could burst.  I also felt sick again so I don't know if there is something else I could try.",Bibi

3,Bumex,Edema,9,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"November 21, 2019",10,Bumex worked great. Took down the swelling of my ankles after Furosemide stopped working. Only problem is that it's very hard on the kidneys especially with a kidney transplant.,Macass
4,Bumex,Edema,10,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"February 1, 2018",20,I got put on Bumex after Lasix stopped working. Bumex is reliable. It works with or without drinking a bunch of water. And the max daily dose is ten 1 mg doses so there is lots of room to increase it for a day if you need to.,ithinktoomuch
5,Bumex,Edema,10,,"July 1, 2015",40,"I had whole body swelling, caused by retaining water. I didn't have ankles, I had cankles, lol. I tried lasix, and 2 weeks later, It was down a little.Ankles still swollen just as much, but hands were going back to normal. Upon going to my check up, my doctor decided to try Bumex 2mg. Within 1 week, I was back to normal. The only problem I had with these pills is they're large and sometimes get stuck in my throat.",lincolnlady73
6,Bumex,Edema,7,,"July 16, 2008",90,This pill was miracle one for me.  I helps me so much with the retained fluid in my body.,Anonymous
