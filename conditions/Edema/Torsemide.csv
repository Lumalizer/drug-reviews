1,Torsemide,Edema,10,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"March 28, 2016",30,"I find that torsemide works very well for me. I don't take it every day, more like every third or fourth day. The only down side is that if I take it every day I get very painful cramps in my thighs. Now I take Calcium-Magnesium and that seems to reduce the incidense of cramping. If one does happen I also take a tablespoon of mustard, recommended by Dr. Oz on tv, which has turmeric in it and that helps very much also.Torsemide helps greatly with reducing any edema that I have in my ankles, feet and legs. Other than the occasional cramping, I experience no other side effects and I will continue taking this drug.",mhami
2,Torsemide,Edema,10,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"September 8, 2014",61,Demadex (torsemide):Torsemide has really been effective in reducing the edema that I suffer from Pulmonary Hypertension.  IT really gets out the extra fluid without any harsh side effects.  I used to take LAsix (furosemide) and I had to be taken off it after I suffered painful red nodules all up and down my legs. Furosemide was far more harsh than the Demadex and I'm glad my doctor switched me to it.,Songbird2114
