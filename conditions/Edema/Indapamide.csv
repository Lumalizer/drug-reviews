0,Indapamide,Edema,8,Taken for less than 1 month,"October 24, 2020",8,"Started Idapamide  1.5 mg  in the am for hypertension with leg edema. (  Had  to change to indapamide  from CANDESARTAN  after developing vasculitis and skin rashes ) First week , I had lost weigh because of frequent urination . BP was up and down, not controlled well .Second week , noticed bloating and feeling gassy ( burping a lot ) . BP was controlled  in the afternoon but higher in the mornings . Had the idea that the medicine wore off at night  making BP in am higher . Frequent urination was not experienced anymore thus , weight is maintained . Third week , still gassy but BP in am and pm well controlled . Still edema noticed but later on the day after walking , standing for long hours.  Still bloated .My take on this medication,1. Give it time to work for control of BP 2 . If side effects  can be experienced after a week of taking it . If they are that bad and affects your daily living , consult your MD",Mia
