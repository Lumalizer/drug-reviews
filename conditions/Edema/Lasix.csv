0,Lasix,Edema,3.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"February 25, 2022",0,"On 1/30/22, I woke up with ankle & foot swelling & pain out of nowhere. I thought it may have been connected to a full body massage I'd gotten 2 days before that but, at this point, it seems it's not. I'm still having this issue 3.5 weeks later, but now the edema is pitting.  I saw my Dr 2 days ago & she pointed out that my calves are also swollen. She prescribed this med for me to take twice a day for three days. She's also sending me for an echocardiogram. So far, I've taken one dose & it maybe the last one I take. I've got the absolute worst optical/sinus headache. I've taken my rx migraine med, rx ibuprofen & 2 OTC sinus pills with no luck. I'm aware headaches are a possible side effect but I didn't expect it to be this bad. As expected, I'm peeing a lot, but the negatives are outweighing the positives.",Jillyn31

4,Lasix,Edema,4.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"July 30, 2020",37,Dr. has me back on lasix again for edema and will try another round.  The first round was 20mg. X 2 for 6mo.s (damn I was patient) for the swelling in my feet.  I was weeing a lot but it didn't hardly reduce the swelling.  I've also noticed a significant increase in the cravings for potassium laden food so I believe it HAS drained me of that!Will try to get Doc to increase it to 40mg all at once as other reviewers have stated that 20mg is not enough... and it sure hasn't been for me.,tinman

6,Lasix,Edema,4.0,,"March 25, 2020",97,"Bilateral edema knees to toes. Dr put me on 1 x a day 20 mg Lasix.  Didn't work at all. Then put me on 2 x a day 20 mg Lasix. Might work a little, however, the problem is that 2 x a day of 20 mg Lasix does not mean you have a dose of 40 mg Lasix--you just have 2, 20 mg doses. So, I started taking two 20 mg at the same time to get a 40 mg dose and now my swelling is slowly going down. Dosage is important.",Bobb
7,Lasix,Edema,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"December 10, 2019",46,Been on these lasix pills for 5 days and I will not take them anymore. I am in the bathroom every few minutes. Sometimes I just sit on the toilet because I know in a few minutes I will have to go again. I will not live this way.,Anonymous
8,Lasix,Edema,10.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"August 2, 2019",103,I have been on lasix for about a year. I think its amazing! It's does make my blood pressure a little low and I've had problems with my potassium levels but it's worth it for how well it works. I ran out of my medicine and couldn't fill my script yet. So I was with out it for a week. I had severe edema. I mean I could barely climb stairs or take the one step on the porch with out almost falling. Got my script and the water was just falling away like magic.,Sis
9,Lasix,Edema,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"May 10, 2019",79,"So I came into the hospital on a Thursday evening for shortness of breath, and two weeks later I'm being treated for edema.  I weighed 636lb when I was admitted.  Today I weigh just north of 500.  136lbs gone just from fluid my body was storing do to my diagnosed CHF.  Most of the weight came off during my 2nd week on the Lasik IV drip.  We have been going slow so that I don't get cramps and dr is doing blood work every morning at 4am.",Big Spurg

11,Lasix,Edema,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"September 1, 2018",76,"I was put on the med and I became extremely confused  (couldn't even remember what house I lived in) and I was at home.  So weak I could hardly get out of  bed. 3 weeks later I was changed to hydrochlorathiazide  for 2 weeks with the same effect, just not quite so severe .  I quit all this type of med and within 24 hours I could tell a difference.I even did some grocery shopping today. The first time in 6 weeks I was exhausted to say the least but  at least I was able to do it. No I didn't carry them in , nor have to them put away. But I was able to do it. I can't wait to see the progress tomorrow.So in conclusion BE CAREFUL",chris

13,Lasix,Edema,,Taken for less than 1 month,"March 19, 2018",134,"Lasix (a potassium-depleting drug) made me pee a lot, but didn't do much to decrease swelling. Then I started taking spironolactone (a potassium-sparing drug ) and almost overnight I lost almost 10 pounds of excess water.  I think the Lasix depleted too much potassium, causing too much retention of sodium  (which in turn caused water retention).  Note:  My diet all along has been low sodium.",Jude
14,Lasix,Edema,,Taken for less than 1 month,"February 25, 2018",59,"I developed idiopathic (so far my docs are clueless) systemic inflammation over the course of 2 wks or so. Plus hypertensive crisis (202/110), never had BP problems before. I’m 5’5 and 120 lbs, but I looked like the Michelin Man after eating the Pillsbury Doughboy. Doc prescribed Lasix, wonderdrug! Peed like a horse for 2 days, almost back to normal. Unfortunately, however, the inflammation seems to have damaged my epidermis. My skin from knees on up to my chest looks like I vomited cottage cheese over it. :(",Noelle
15,Lasix,Edema,5.0,,"October 2, 2017",49,Much foot and leg swelling.  Just finished 9 days hospitalization for pneumonia.   Took steroid for several days after discharge.  As I quit steroid swelling started so I ended up  starting lasix.  Urination every 2 hours.  I have high blood pressure. Atrial fibrulation.  Tremendous sweating.  Edema is  slowly going down.,trasmus3

17,Lasix,Edema,9.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"December 4, 2016",100,I have severe Lymphadima and venous edema with pitting. I made the mistake of taking the medicine at night and was up urinating every 30-40 minutes in large quantities all night. This medicine made me extremely thirsty so you have to be sure to drink plenty of water when taking this medicine.,Peeps Widow

19,Lasix,Edema,6.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"November 22, 2015",118,"I was prescribed the generic form of Lasix a few days ago for severe peripheral edema. The doctor had me taking 20 mg twice a day for three days and now I'm taking 20 mg. So far, I have notice only a subtle difference/improvement in the major swelling of my feet, ankles, legs and abdomen. I am experiencing an increase in frequency of urination, as others have described, but it doesn't seem like I 'm voiding enough, which may be why I am still so swollen. It has been only four days on Lasix and I am in terrible pain. Hopefully, the swelling will subside or at least decrease, otherwise, I will be contacting the MD for advice. I have also experienced headaches daily since I began the medication. I have been extremely dizzy as well.",MarlboroFiona
20,Lasix,Edema,10.0,,"January 5, 2015",169,I started taking this medication when I was in my early 20's for edema.  I take 80 mg a day for 20 years now.  If I miss a day I go up about 12 lbs on the scale.This medication has worked wonders for me but it is hard to take if you need to leave the house.  I can pee up to 20 times in 4 hours.Other than the inconvenience.  It is a fantastic medication for me.,Laurie Dagere
21,Lasix,Edema,8.0,,"April 13, 2014",134,"My cardiologist put me on Lasix over a month ago due to edema of the legs and ankles. My rate of urination was about every 45 minutes nowhere as bad as some of the reviewers. I refilled my prescription and noticed an immediate change. Instead of every 45 minutes, it changed to every hour and a half. The only difference is the manufacturer.  The Lasix made by Sandoz seems to work fine. ",Choir pork
22,Lasix,Edema,8.0,,"January 28, 2014",160,"I stated taking Furosemide yesterday for swelling in my feet and ankles. Right after taking it I had to make a 100 mile drive and ended up stopping 5 times en route to pee. The swelling has already decreased a LOT, and I am able to walk again without pain. I had pretty bad nausea after both doses. I am taking 40 mg once a day. I had to call in sick today as the nausea was causing vomiting. I'll try taking it after work. I went back to bed after calling in sick today and my cat that always sleeps on me was quite annoyed at trips to the bathroom every 10 minutes.",JohnHalo

25,Lasix,Edema,10.0,,"May 14, 2012",177,"I have a genetic condition called Venous Insufficiency, which doesn't allow the blood & fluid to be returned from my lower legs & feet, so they swell and the skin can start to break down, which opens up the opportunity for infection.  Have been taking Furosemide 40mg 1x day for over a year now - it is the only thing that keeps me from being in the hospital all the time with infections that require IV antibiotics. The only side effects I've noticed are the very frequent urination (not really a side effect, it's what the drug is *supposed* to do, as it flushes fluids out of the body), and aching in my legs and feet as the fluid leaves - I can only assume that is caused by my body trying to push the fluid out.",Anonymous
26,Lasix,Edema,9.0,,"February 4, 2011",135,"I've been taking Lasix for about 10 years for swelling in my feet/ankles. I only have one kidney and have hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.  I take 80 mg in the morning.  It does not always take all the swelling out, but if I miss just one dose, I can tell it by the afternoon.  Of course, if I take it in the afternoon, I'm up all night.  NOTE: There IS a difference in taking the Lasix as opposed to the generic furosemide.  For me, the generic is absolutely useless.  My mother had the same problem, so maybe it's genetic.  I've taken as much as 200 mg of generic at one time with no effect whatsoever.  I've noticed no side effects from the Lasix.",Anonymous

28,Lasix,Edema,10.0,,"September 30, 2010",93,"I have had pitting edema, severe water retention all over my body mainly my face, hands, ankles, feet and lower legs.  I to have felt the side effects of the side aches and leg discomfort. BUt have come to find out I also suffered from RLS ( restless leg syndrome). I do suffer from very minor headaches. But when one day you are swollen as a balloon and about 2 to 3 days later your are unswollen.  I first started out on 10 mg as needed, then had to go up to 20mg when required, then daily. Then eventually kept raising it by 20 after that to 40mg daily. Then I ended up having to take 2 x 40 mg daily, 2 x a day.  I also have insulin resistance/metabolic syndrome so that may have something to do with it. I'm now at 80mg daily.",ksop

I went to my doctor and she prescribed this medication to me, it's working like magic! I take it in the morning as soon I wake up, I noticed it's more effective taken on empty stomach, then after breakfast and so on.

I took the second dose earlier in the afternoon the next day.  The cramp in my midriff returned.  I called the hospital where my doctor practices and the nurse practitioner from her office called me back.  She advised me not to take the Lasix anymore and to go to the ER if the cramping came back tonight.  My ankle is nearly normal size, but I am not sure it was worth it.",skinny ankle
36,Lasix,Edema,4.0,,"June 3, 2009",107,"It's very important to read the side effects of all the medicines that your Doctor prescribes to you. Sometimes the side effects are a bigger problem then the original problem you were trying to treat. This was true in my case with Furosemide where the blurred vision, loud ringing in the ears and a bright red flaky face rash was unbearable. But that's not to say that everyone will suffer side effects.",Anonymous
