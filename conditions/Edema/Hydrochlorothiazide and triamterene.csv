0,Hydrochlorothiazide and triamterene,Edema,7.0,Taken for 5 to 10 years,"July 9, 2019",15,I’ve been taking this hydrochlorothiazide with triamterene for years as a diuretic with no issues until last month. The manufacturer changed and at my pharmacy and I do not believe it works the same. My Meniere’s symptoms haven’t been this bad since I started taking the different brand. I hoping another pharmacy has the  prior manufacturers medicine because it worked well.,Vertigo Girl

3,Hydrochlorothiazide and triamterene,Edema,2.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"October 25, 2016",16,"I was prescribed this pill for edema. I took it sporadically, maybe once a week. Then increased to twice a week. I noticed I began having panic attack symptoms. They would come out of nowhere. Inability to breathe normally, gasping for air. I kept thinking they were random panic attacks of which I'd never had in the past. Last night I took a pill at 8 p.m. within an hour, i woke myself up from dozing off in my recliner. I couldn't breathe again. This time it was accompanied with almost a wheezing feeling in my chest. I couldn't walk without gasping for air. I took 2 Benadryl waited 20 min, took another & all the symptoms vanished. I feel like my A- blood type has made me super sensitive to meds. Ugh.",Gina Bo-Bina

5,Hydrochlorothiazide and triamterene,Edema,1.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"January 22, 2016",34,"I have been on this medication for a few months now, for the second time. Both times I have developed severe headaches, dizziness, confusion, and nauseous. It takes off some water weight but I'm still fairly swollen and this time my blood pressure has increased. Just learned that it can affect blood sugar levels. I don't think I will be taking this medication again.",ElisabethC
6,Hydrochlorothiazide and triamterene,Edema,8.0,,"December 21, 2015",13,"I was taking Maxzide for several years and had to stop, temporarily, for other health issues. Within days, my face was so puffy, had gained 8 pounds and then my ankes and feet became very swollen and achey. I sure hope the doctor will let me start taking it again and figure out a different resolution for the other issue!",ltlbird
7,Hydrochlorothiazide and triamterene,Edema,8.0,,"June 4, 2015",68,I am on Day 3 of this medicine.  I dropped 6.2 lbs. of water. I got leg cramps the first night and realized I did not drink enough water and that I needed low sodium V8 to increase my potassium levels so I don't cramp. My blood pressure is back to normal and it is great to see my ankles and legs stop swelling.  On Day 2 and 3 no problems.  Drink plenty of water and drink V8 or eat a banana to up your potassium.,Kat7
8,Hydrochlorothiazide and triamterene,Edema,1.0,,"May 3, 2015",23,"This drug almost killed me. I lost nearly 15 lbs. in 3 days. No, I wasn't exercising and yes most people would celebrate, but I was severely dehydrated and had a head ache that WOULD NOT GO AWAY.

10,Hydrochlorothiazide and triamterene,Edema,9.0,Taken for 10 years or more,"July 24, 2014",55,Dyazide (hydrochlorothiazide / triamterene):I break a 50 mg tablet in half and take the half every other day.  It really works and I find I need to increase my liquid intake particularly on the days I take the 1/2 tablet otherwise I tend to have some muscular cramping.  This is especially true in leg muscles.,Pamepie

12,Hydrochlorothiazide and triamterene,Edema,6.0,,"April 8, 2012",20,"I have high blood pressure and edema. The hydrochlorothiazide definitely made me lose water weight- about 6-7 pounds but it really seemed to cut sexual desire and often made me nauseous and gave me diarrhea. I had to stop taking it because of the nausea. The night after the first day I'd stopped taking it, my sexual desire returned but when I got up to urinate, I noticed the veins on my penis were abnormally enlarged. The veins went back to normal after that night. I think I had a reverse reaction when my body tried to adjust to the medicine being out of my system. Probably the water had no escape mechanism without the medication.",waternam
13,Hydrochlorothiazide and triamterene,Edema,1.0,,"December 3, 2009",32,The swelling in my feet and ankles decreased over the course of five days but it interacted with my anti-depressant medication and rendered it useless.  I couldn't even force myself to get out of bed.  I lost all interest in activities that I had enjoyed.  Had to stop taking it.,njmonica
14,Hydrochlorothiazide and triamterene,Edema,9.0,,"August 7, 2008",35,"I've been taking maxzide-25 for over a year and it definitely keeps the fluid from hanging around the ankles. I initally had a mild nagging headache the first 3 days, after that no problems.",S'NIABLU
