0,Sertraline,Borderline Personality Disorder,10.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"December 26, 2021",1,"For years I was bounced around from one medication to the next, could never cut the edge of outrageous behavior, mood swings to the point people were distancing themselves from me... nor would I have blamed them. After many years of seeing doctors, psychiatrists, therapists and many different medication sertraline has finally made my life a lot easier. Work is no long a dread, my friendships are restored and I have never felt such happiness. For many years I looked 20 years older then what I was due to the immense stress and anxiety. Changed my life!",Anonymous
1,Sertraline,Borderline Personality Disorder,3.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"November 19, 2021",1,"Anxiety worsened as soon as I started this medication at 25mg. Went to the ER they increased it to 50mg. Have had nausea ever time I take it. Last night I woke up into a panic attack. Apart from the anxiety it does help increase my mood. I will further monitor this drug, hopefully the side effects wear off.",Dianna
2,Sertraline,Borderline Personality Disorder,2.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"October 7, 2021",0,"75mg sertraline daily which helped greatly with depressive symptoms, but drastically increased impulsivity, irritability, and intense mood fluctuations. For me the negatives outweighed the positives.",donnie
3,Sertraline,Borderline Personality Disorder,2.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"September 20, 2021",1,"I was originally prescribed Sertraline for my anxiety and depression, and only got diagnosed with BPD afterwards. My dosage got bumped up from 75mg to 125mg and all I’ve been noticing is that my symptoms are getting worse. My mood swings have been more frequent and more intense. I haven’t been able to pay attention to my anxiety and depression since, well, my anger and my other symptoms have just been terrible.",Mac

6,Sertraline,Borderline Personality Disorder,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"April 4, 2021",5,"I struggle with Borderline and GAD / depression since forever. I must say, this med has been a lifesaver. I started a month ago following an appointment with my psychiatrist. The pain, emptiness, and knife in the heart I always felt is finally gone. I only take 25mg. First week was kinda rough because I felt nothing, I couldn't feel sad, horny or whatever. Everything came back by week 2/3. I feel better, normal, without the pain. I'm working on myself as well, but the med helped me loose 4kg so far, regulating my overeating due to bad emotions. I feel healthy and good. Thanks to this med ! I'm 22 btw.",Soso
7,Sertraline,Borderline Personality Disorder,9.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"February 23, 2021",4,"I’ve been taking Sertraline (50-150mg fluctuating throughout the years) for approximately 5 years now - before I had been diagnosed with BPD. I can absolutely say it keeps me grounded and level-headed, as well as helping me with mood fluctuations. There is a very noticeable difference when I am off Sertraline. It was my 2nd SSRI tried. Negative side effects included weight gain and nausea.",shammy
8,Sertraline,Borderline Personality Disorder,9.0,Taken for 10 years or more,"February 23, 2021",12,"Hi, I've been on 200mg of sertraline for over 20 years. It really helps control my moods swings which would constantly change many times in a hour. I have tried many drugs, but this is the only one that has controlled the anger mood. I still struggle every day with chronic depression lack of motivation, to do the normal daily tasks or cooking washing, and house work. I do believe I've been misdiagnosed but after all these years it's pointless trying to get any further help.",Booboo
9,Sertraline,Borderline Personality Disorder,1.0,,"December 5, 2020",3,"I had one 50mg of the generic brand sertraline from Milpharm, ( had Zoloft in past with little side effects). I started and took just one dose and within a couple hours I was really nauseous, jaw clenching, heart racing and thumping, couldn’t keep still, pupils dilated, insomnia, crazy thoughts ( not suicidal but just random looping vivid images in my head). It was horrendous. My skin felt like it was burning/prickling. That feeling lasted 24 hours, I took some Zopiclone the night after and I’ve woke up feeling better. Doctor and Psychiatrist both said to stop immediately. I have read that some docs/psychs tell patients to ride these side effects out for the 2 weeks. I’m glad they told me to stop. I did wonder whether it was because  the brand was different because the last time taking the Zoloft brand it was nothing like that and actually the medication worked as I was told and had a positive experience on it.",Poppy
10,Sertraline,Borderline Personality Disorder,7.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"October 20, 2020",6,"Started Zoloft for Borderline Personality Disorder a year ago. Took a few months to get used to the feeling being on it. It has helped stabilize my mood greatly but I do go through periods of time where everything feels surreal or like every sensation feels very different, especially during sex. It seems to come in waves and then normalize again.",Cordi

12,Sertraline,Borderline Personality Disorder,8.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"March 28, 2020",20,"Been on this sertraline for about 3 months, and it hass definitely helped with my co-morbid depression and anxiety. Day to day I'm much more stable and able to focus on other things opposed to my emotions spiralling all over the place. If theres something that I find particularly triggering however, it doesn't do much to dampen the immediate response. Also my impulsivity is still an issue but now taking shape in binge eating opposed to self harm. That said, the difference has been big and positive for me. Some of the side effects are not pleasant (lethargy, nightmares, no libido) but there are probably worse.",MISSEEK
13,Sertraline,Borderline Personality Disorder,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"February 7, 2020",21,"So my doctor told me this drug (sertraline) isn't for everyone with borderline personality disorder and boy was he right. For me a few hours after taking it I show all the symptoms of a fever, sweating, vomiting, light sensitivity, hot and cold flushes and complete disorientation. Please note that this is just what happened to me and I know that it works for others, so please like I did try it if a doctor has recommended it as it could help. I'm only posting this so that others who may get these side affects know that it is normal and that they shouldn't panic like I did haha",Jimmy0308
14,Sertraline,Borderline Personality Disorder,10.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"January 30, 2020",20,"I recommend Sertraline but only w/ a mood stabilizer like Lamictal. I was on sertraline for depression & Buspirone for anxiety and I went to a psychiatrist who said I needed a mood stabilizer. My mania, mood swings, irrationality, irritability, highs & lows, alcoholism went away or became manageable. I got off Zoloft and Buspirone. I am going back on Zoloft as the mood stabilizer didn’t fully fix my lows. I still had spontaneous crying episodes over nothing and melancholy emotions randomly. I LOVE sertraline & lamictal together!",Tyrell

I was finally diagnosed with major depressive disorder, anxiety and borderline. I have been on Zoloft for 2 months now. I feel like it is helping as my manic paranoid episodes have decreased. About a week before starting this medication I was fully convinced my employer was plotting to get me arrested by planting evidence on me... so yes the manic episodes were quite severe. I have experienced little to no side effects from Zoloft, aside from decreased/ non existing libido. I know a lot of medications made my anxiety worse, especially cipralex.

No energy, no motivation, things seem to affect me more, cannot concentrate, I avoid talking to or seeing people, and feel more depressed. I hate this medication and was put on it because of my BPD and OCD which has helped with OCD but not BPD. Feeling discouraged wondering if these side effects will pass soon.",Mel

I used to use it in combination with quetiapine but now just take on its own and it allows me to live a ‘normal’ life. Nobody would know I have/had Borderline Personality Disorder.

22,Sertraline,Borderline Personality Disorder,6.0,,"May 30, 2019",12,I’ve been on sertraline for the past couple of months and I found that it’s made me extremely numb in a lot of situations and I am unable to feel quite often and I don’t have a very fast reaction time. My depression symptoms are not as bad although it’s pretty bad at regulating emotions. I would suggest it for people who can remember to take it regularly but if you’re not someone who can do that then I wouldn’t suggest.  it makes you very lethargic.,rubyyyhiil

Depression still gone but my BPD is in full swing. The rage I feel is killing me, my crazy behaviour is back and it’s safe to say, I’m going back on Zoloft ASAP.

I had 25mg (half pill) and after the 10th day I got a full of 50mg I have Borderline Personality Disorder, and light depression, which becomes extremely severe when I have a break up. In the past, I had suffered from panic attacks, suicidal thoughts and obsessive thoughts.After my last break up I didn't wanna jeopardize being in a similar situation so I practically requested from my Psychiatrist to prescribe something that could ease my ups and downs. The first week was tough, cold sweats, frustration, emotional outbreaks and loss of control, along with diarrhea. The last 3 days I am feeling more stable and the outbreaks are not that intense. I'm more apathetic.",No Limits

My dr thinks it was the sertraline that reacted badly with my brain, leaving me now prone to having psychotic eps. I tried different dosages too, starting from the smallest dosage. I would never recommend it to anyone after what i experienced with it but then again everyone is different. All i know is that Sertraline made me worse mentally.",TamHighett
