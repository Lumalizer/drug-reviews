0,Clonazepam,Borderline Personality Disorder,9,Taken for less than 1 month,"September 2, 2021",0,"I currently am taking clonazepam 0.5mg three times daily as needed. I also take Vyvanse 50mg once daily to treat my ADHD. I noticed almost immediately that these two medications seemed to balance each other in a very positive way. The Vyvanse counters the fatigue and mental fog that is common with benzodiazepines, while the Clonazepam counters the tremors, excessive sweating and elevated heart rate that I occasionally experienced as a side affect from the Vyvanse. But overall, Clonazepam has saved my life, I truly mean that. It’s helping me stay stable enough until my long term medications reach their proper levels can take over as primary pharmaceutical treatment in combination with DBT. This is of course my personal experience, everyone’s brain is very different, especially when it comes to us Borderlines. Keep researching, keep discussing with your doctor, I promise you that you will find the right combination of medication and therapy. Stay safe my friends :).",OnTheBorder
1,Clonazepam,Borderline Personality Disorder,9,Taken for less than 1 month,"February 7, 2021",3,"I have BPD, OCD (Pure O(intruisive thoughts)) and dissociation that comes from anxiety.I was tried all sorts of benzos and my opinion is that Klonopin works the best for anxiety and comorbid conditions, it helped me put me in balance and the more I take it (longer period of time) I see improvements of my general mental health because it clears my brain fog caused by anxiety. I am able to think straight and is helping me to put in check symptoms that I can not control my own  I take it for 2 weeks, 0.5-1 mg per day with few days off, for now it works great. Also I use omega 3 and do cognitive exercises just to prevent some cognitive deficits like memory loss because of benzos. Ofc, like all benzos be careful taking it and if you don't need it don't take it, don't use it for experiencing some highs or something, benzos are extremely dangerous if you get hooked up on them, wish you all the best and good health✌",Lovro
2,Clonazepam,Borderline Personality Disorder,10,Taken for 10 years or more,"June 28, 2018",23,"Clonazepam has made a new life for me. I agree with the experience of the first reviewer; waking up is so nice with clonazepam. I would suggest that anyone taking this medication just learn all about its usage, dosage and side effects. I will say very bluntly, life isn't worth the struggle without clonazepam.",Bud

4,Clonazepam,Borderline Personality Disorder,9,Taken for 5 to 10 years,"August 14, 2017",28,"I suffer with BPD (Borderline Personality) Major Depression, and Generalized Anxiety. I've taken Clonazepam as needed for a few years now. It's not something you should take DAILY like an antidepressant. That's where you get into abusing it. Taking it as needed, which for me is maybe once per week if that, helps. I get mentally and emotionally wound up and Clonazepam helps tremendously with just stopping it. Imagine crying your eyes out for hours and there's nothing that can make it stop, then you take a Clonazepam. Within a few minutes the extreme emotions just fall away and you can just breath and relax. In short, if it's taken right, it's a lifesaver. If you have an addictive personality I wouldn't tempt it.",YinzerGirl
