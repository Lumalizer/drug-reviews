0,Citalopram,Borderline Personality Disorder,10,Taken for 10 years or more,"February 14, 2022",1,"Citalopram has made a significant difference in treating my borderline personality disorder. I felt so out of control like I was on an emotional roller coaster I couldn't get off. Since being on this medication I feel like I have my control back. I take 40mg 1x daily. The side effects for me have been a decreased sex drive, sleepiness (solved by taking it before bed), and at the beginning diarrhea for the first three months or so. All side effects have been far outweighed by the benefits.",Jo marie
1,Citalopram,Borderline Personality Disorder,9,Taken for less than 1 month,"September 27, 2021",5,I am a mid 40s male and have been diagnosed as being high spectrum Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD). This is my second time on citralopram (20mg). For me it kicks in straight away despite the doctors saying it takes weeks to work. It dramatically reduces my anxiety and I am able to cope a lot better outside my home. My world seems to physically colour up as well.The citralopram noticeably reduces my sex drive which has led me into problems before with impulsivity/promiscuity. Also to note climaxing is more difficult. I am also able to concentrate at work and become less bored in my everyday life. This has led me in the past with difficulties in often wanting to live life on the edge with drugs etc. However citalopram doesn't take away the burning pain of my emotional sensitivity and reactions when triggered/activated it just seems to dial it down a notch and give one a little more room to think and take the edge of the aftermath.,BPD Male

3,Citalopram,Borderline Personality Disorder,10,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"November 6, 2020",11,"I have been on citalopram for only 7 weeks but the improvement in my mood, anxiety, and outlook has been amazing. My sleep routine has improved also. I have no urge at present for any destructive compulsive behaviour, drink, sexual promiscuity, gambling. I am far more calm and measured. It's been an absolute revelation",Phillo

5,Citalopram,Borderline Personality Disorder,10,,"July 17, 2020",26,"I have BPD which makes me feel emotions to an extreme extent. I got bad to the point everyday I was crying couldn’t get out of bed or go out the house had anxiety over anything and everything was having panic episodes and intrusive thoughts, hearing voices all I just didn't want to go on really couldn’t see a way out, decided to take citalopram (have been on it before and it worked wonders). I am day 3 this medicine always works straight away for me despite the doctor saying give it a month until it works properly. Since taking it I feel calm and happy none of the bad emotions have come up, a little anxiety came up but I only felt it mildly then it left. The first time I went on this medication it took my appetite and weight loss, hot flushes and was sleeping nearly all the time for the first month. This time I haven’t had any side effects at all it’s only day 3 but I feel amazing am getting out of bed early and getting on with my day, happy to go outside and Be in the world. My dose is 20mg",Naomi
6,Citalopram,Borderline Personality Disorder,10,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"May 13, 2020",13,"I take Citalopram 10mg to manage depression/anxiety along with 25mg of Lamictal for impulsivity/rage associated with Borderline personality disorder BPD. I find this combination is the first that has been effective in treating my symptoms (rage, depression, obsessive-compulsive thinking). I'm also taking B and D vitamins because I was deficient, which added to the frequency of depression and rage. This is a great combination for me so far (3 weeks in). This is the first time in 3 years I haven't had an episode in over 3 weeks!",Poetic_Angel
7,Citalopram,Borderline Personality Disorder,8,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"November 7, 2018",9,Started with 20mg for a 18 year old female experiencing depression and anxiety mainly based from a BPD diagnosis. Noticed a positive change in my depression after about 2 weeks but not much change in my anxiety. I went up to 40mg after my first month and it really helped my anxiety as well. Didn’t make me feel numb like most other antidepressants and I still felt like myself!,maddiethill
8,Citalopram,Borderline Personality Disorder,1,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"April 19, 2017",6,Terrible experience with this drug. Made mood swings hell of alot worse after only a few weeks. This put me off treatment for a while.,Speed292
9,Citalopram,Borderline Personality Disorder,8,,"July 13, 2016",16,"I have dosed at 20mg and 10mg and I've found that 10mg works best for me. I started taking cit after getting divorced to deal with anxiety (I have PTSD and my ex exacerbated this with stalking). If I take it on an empty stomach it can give me nausea but a banana or something simple fixes this. It will give me a mild headache about an hour after taking but that doesn't last long. I do not take any other meds or herbs. I am a white female over 50. On 20 mg I felt so ""relaxed"" I tended to spend money I shouldn't. I dosed down to keep that in check. It helps me manage single parenting stress and reduces angry reactions in stressful situations. Other than the light headaches and mild temporary nausea, no other side effects.",WorkingOnIt2
