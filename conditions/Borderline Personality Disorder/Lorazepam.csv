0,Lorazepam,Borderline Personality Disorder,10,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"March 21, 2020",20,"0.5 mg lorazepam. This is awesome when a serious meltdown is brewing and skills are really really hard to use. My prescriber is great and only gives me 12/month and said to only use it when I truly need it, which is what I do being aware of tolerance issues others are reporting here. Sort of ""in case of an emergency"" so I don't even use the 12 which I know is in my best interests. When I use it it just feels like I feel functional again and can get back to life without having this mess of terrible thoughts in my mind preventing me from doing *everything*. I definitely recommend this for those ""in case of emergencies"" times.",AeonRex
1,Lorazepam,Borderline Personality Disorder,10,,"October 10, 2018",17,"I have taken Ativan off and on for about 5 years. I take 2 mg a couple of hours before bed. (6ish). I have nightmares from past abuse (severe adolescent abuse,  smothered by a family a member, neglected). I'm 36 yr old female who had been diagnosed with BPD and PTSD. I only take Ativan. It helps. Tolerance does build up every few weeks I cut my doses, taper, and readjust. This medicine works for me and my mental health.",Tree
2,Lorazepam,Borderline Personality Disorder,8,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"June 2, 2016",27,"Excellent for dealing with anxiety induced panic attacks, helped regulate mood swings, and really helped with sleep. However, tolerance builds up quickly and addiction is a serious concern. As such, it helped only as a short term solution to bridge the gap into a more stable regiment of medication.",Aaronson
