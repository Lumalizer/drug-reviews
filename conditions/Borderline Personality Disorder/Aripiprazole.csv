0,Aripiprazole,Borderline Personality Disorder,2.0,,"February 14, 2022",0,"As Quetiapine made me gain significant weight, my doctor prescribed Aripiprazole. Works as good as quetiapine for rage outburst and impulsivity. However, have some prohibitive side effects for me. I got extremely confused. Thinking is an overwhelming activity. I cannot follow any conversation, book, writing, article, whatever. And I got extremely warm, but I do not sweat. I feel like a pressure cooker. I started with quite high dose (10mg), but even taking 2mg three times a week, the side effects does not go away. Every morning I take the drug, my day is a huge unproductive, warm, and confusing as anythingl. My sight changed as well, it is hard to read.I have some problems with temperature. Anything above 14 degrees Celsius is already extremely uncomfortable for me. So, I think I am a point out of the curve. Do not let my bad experience afraid you from trying this medication, for most of people it is a good option. I will go back to Quetiapine and try to deal with the weight gain.",Phillipe
1,Aripiprazole,Borderline Personality Disorder,10.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"November 11, 2021",1,"I started Abilify because my insurance wouldn't pay for Rexaulti. For me personally, it works. No paranoia issues towards my partners or loved ones, no anger outbursts, no self harm... repeat, NO SELF HARM!! This one is so important..... Its like I became southern and started sipping sweet tea on my front porch swing in the sun. I can enjoy life now. It helps control my emotions when I want to cry, I don't think I have even cried more than twice since I started about 8 months ago. I have had some weight gain, but I'm actually losing weight right now, I think the weight gain was from the rexaulti so there is that. My libido is a bit down, but maybe its cause I work a full work week and have two small children and I'm exhausted by the 8 pm.... It is so much easier to be optimistic. If you have Borderline Personality Disorder (bpd) and are reading these reviews like I did before I started this med, please, for the love of yourself, try it. Give it some time. It could very well save your life.",JazRain
2,Aripiprazole,Borderline Personality Disorder,1.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"October 26, 2021",0,Started on a low dose to treat my depression/anxiety/PTSD all at the same time. We upped my dose. It did nothing but make me disassociate for days at a time. When I wasn’t in a fog It made my ADHD  unbearable. I was restless and exhausted all the time. The only good that came out of being on aripiprazole was learning how to ground myself when I started disassociating (Because I was doing it so often). Definitely not for me.,Ktrs
3,Aripiprazole,Borderline Personality Disorder,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"October 17, 2021",12,"I have struggled with BPD symptoms and tried many antidepressants, and buspirone. Nothing has worked this well for me. I feel like I can collect my thoughts better in arguments. I don’t have anger outbursts anymore. I was so sick of feeling guilty after every argument. My psychiatrist wanted to add another antidepressant and I was so encouraged by the reviews on here, I said I wanted abilify. I am SO glad I said I wanted it. I’ve only been taking it a week and I feel amazing. All the delusions I had about my partner are gone. I feel like I can live my life the way it should have been, without the trauma.",Bambi
4,Aripiprazole,Borderline Personality Disorder,10.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"September 25, 2021",2,"This medicine has worked very well for my Dissociative Identity Disorder (DID), keeping me stable by preventing switching/mood swings. I thought I was going to lose my job due to lack of stability, but this medicine saved me.",hailey
5,Aripiprazole,Borderline Personality Disorder,1.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"July 2, 2021",3,"This medication does nothing for me effectively except flatline my emotions - and I definitely can't find happiness in life if that is occurring. Part of true happiness is being able to feel your own art of sentiments and hormonal fluctuations - none of which Abilify enables me to do. So it's no good. I am not just going to settle for a fancy pharmaceutical product that knocks out my depression by numbing me. That's unacceptable. I'm a human being - not someone who is okay to trade off on MDD pain  in exchange for some unfeeling disconnect. I cannot think with an interest and to compile on top of that, my bodily tension is 10x worse. I cannot sleep even when I think I might finally be sleepy! And the ironic thing is: It's a total nightmare!And to exacerbate all of this - I'm simply not me anymore. I can't associate to align my own thoughts with an identity. That's not okay....I am discontinuing this. I will continue taking my Celexa and that is good enough for me.",Heatherd
6,Aripiprazole,Borderline Personality Disorder,9.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"May 26, 2021",3,"This medication has greatly helped my BPD symptoms by reducing my irritability, aggressiveness and hostility as well as reducing my depression, anxiety and paranoia. I stopped taking it a little bit ago and after about two months all my symptoms started coming back with a vengeance. I stopped taking it because I thought I could manage my symptoms on my own again but that did not go as planned. I even had a very bad episode with a break up with a potential partner and my depression got so bad that I had to go to the hospital. After I got discharged from the hospital both me and my Mom decided that I needed to get back on it as soon as possible.The only things that this medication hasn't helped me with are my episodes of feeling empty inside as well as some identity issues and feeling lost about who I am from time to time. However, I can honestly say that this medication is a lifesaver and has helped me live a much better quality of life than without it.",PinkLady06
7,Aripiprazole,Borderline Personality Disorder,9.0,Taken for 5 to 10 years,"April 12, 2021",17,"I have been on and off this medication since I was 16 years old. I’m now 26. It is the ONLY THING that has ever worked so incredibly well for my borderline personality disorder (BPD) with BPD I have intense, frequent mood swings, suicidal depression, outbursts of rage, and periods of apathy and numbness. The Abilify gets rid of all of that for me!! I can’t really live a decent life without it. Whenever I get off of it I feel okay for a month and then BAM all my symptoms return. I know this medication could potentially cause tardive dyskinesia but I feel I absolutely must stay on this medication. It makes everything seem so...bearable! I don’t lose my temper or lose hope, like I do when I’m off Abilify.I got off of it due to weight gain, but honestly I’ve always had a weight problem. I do believe the Abilify exacerbated the issue, but I need the medication to function properly. I know it’s different for everyone. But thank goodness it works for me!",Candychan
8,Aripiprazole,Borderline Personality Disorder,8.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"March 26, 2021",6,"Abilify has helped me so much, I have borderline personality disorder, so medication is used to treat our symptoms, not illness. Abilify has greatly decreased my mood swings, helped with my angry outbursts and also helped eliminate most of my paranoia. It does make me a little anxious and I've been a little bit nauseous but other than that I've had close to no negative side effects. I haven't gained weight either which I know is a concern for most people before starting. I've been on it for roughly a month so far and. I'm at 5mgs, I hope this medicine helps you as much as it's helped me",May
9,Aripiprazole,Borderline Personality Disorder,10.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"March 3, 2021",18,"I am diagnosed with BPD and ADHD. I was put on this Aripiprizole after suffering a psychotic breakdown/insomnia/mania/suicide attempt and so on. My hallucinations/delusions went away IMMEDIATELY and so did my uncontrollable rage which led to self harm. It has massively helped my social anxiety/panic attacks. Also, since being on this medication I have managed to sleep 8 hours a night which I never have before in my life (I'm 29yrs old). I have gone from 5mg to 20mg and have had NO side effects whatsoever.Aripiprizole is AMAZING and I would not be here if it wasn't for this medication.",Nev
10,Aripiprazole,Borderline Personality Disorder,1.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"November 9, 2020",6,Abilify was horrible for my wife who was on it for 6 months.  She started on 5mg and was bumped up to 10mg after 2 months.  Abilify caused her to gamble online which she had never done before and spend hundreds on items we did not need.  It also caused her to have an affair.  When I sat down and asked her to think back what caused her to do these things  she stated it was the urge for excitement that pushed her to do these things.  This medicine should not be prescribed to anyone with side effects like this.  I don't trust the percentages are accurate.  If the percentages were 1 in 100 chance of having this happen to you or your loved one its not worth it so why even consider it for 1 in 5 chance.  They need to ban this drug.,Thefamilyman
11,Aripiprazole,Borderline Personality Disorder,7.0,,"November 3, 2020",12,"Aripiprazole dosage: 10mg for 9 months, 15mg since August.Pro: I have to say it works very well on anger outbursts and irritability (better than quetiapine XR 300mg). I don't have had more self-harm and pseudo-epileptic episodes. I can better manage frustrations and dissatisfactions, without more explosions of hopelessness and despair. Overall my mood is stable and my social functioning has had a drastically improvement. Cons: I'm a bit restless but it's manageable. In my case the side effects are primarily aesthetics. I gained 7kg from January and I have lost good part of my dense crown. No EPS.Conclusion: Overall I stay better than before. I shaved myself and I'm starting to do some physical activities to balance out the weight gain side effects. I continue to have social anxiety disorder (I feel a prey of others eyes) that doesn't responds to SSRI. So my quality of life is still low. But I advise Abilify for BPD: if you don't have my comorbidities  it could work for you",ndr_mlt
12,Aripiprazole,Borderline Personality Disorder,10.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"July 17, 2020",17,"I have borderline personality disorder. Since I started on the medication I haven’t dissociated as much as before at all. Barely anything across years. Huge plus. I’m also not as suspicious/paranoid socially/interrelation-wise as before, which used to really muck me up. So that’s huge. I feel like I’m just more sane and my mind is not as scattered or neurotic/paranoid. I’m still not sane and I’m still neurotic lol and there’s a long road to recovery but I definitely feel a difference from this medicine. It’s like I got one little extra layer of skin to protect me from my hyperrr-sensitivity.  Thankful for this medicine.",Nicki
13,Aripiprazole,Borderline Personality Disorder,7.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"January 29, 2020",10,"I’ve been on this drug, Abilify, for a week now and the side effects were almost instant. The first day I took the medication (5mg) I was dizzy and had a drunk feeling. But went away within 5-7 minutes. Day 2-3 I began to itch and feel as if bugs were on me. But to be fair I had just taken a hike and found ticks on me and I believe it unfair to say the itching was a side effect because of the psychosomatic effects of ticks. Day 3-4 I had RLS and couldn’t stand still without rocking or moving my legs. Also I would have headaches in the evening time. On a scale from 1-10 I would say about a 3. Not crippling but definitely annoying.Also I find it a little difficult to carry on a conversation because I feel kind of spacey throughout the day. Yet I am aware and alert. The positives are I feel more calm and level. I would have major anger outbursts. I still have them but they aren’t as long or detrimental. I am really looking forward to when the medicine takes full effect.",mAnger
14,Aripiprazole,Borderline Personality Disorder,5.0,,"October 11, 2019",15,"I was on Abilify for about 3-4 months. And don’t get me wrong, it worked for my BPD but it also brought on Akathisia. Made me really anxious and restless ALL THE TIME. And most recently it’s thrown me into a depressive state. In the last few weeks to a month I haven’t felt like myself and I don’t enjoy doing the things I used to. My doctor just recently took me off it so I’m excited to feel myself again. I wouldn’t knock it until you try it bc it did work for me, the side effects just got to be too much to handle. But everyone is different.",Eb
15,Aripiprazole,Borderline Personality Disorder,7.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"August 5, 2019",16,"I was put on Abilify for Borderline Personality Disorder and it  helped my anxiety and mood swings a lot. Although, I had to lower my dose so my insurance would cover it. I had the shakes so bad that it was really hard at the start. It was a chore just to live thru that. But it helped my moods a lot. After 2 weeks on it, it kicks in full force and made me feel like I was constantly on a caffeine high but without the anxiety of it. I was so happy, and was finally able to live. But after the dose got lowered, I panicked and quit my job, walked home, accepted a ride from a stranger, argued with my partner, and had a mood swings. So don't mess with missing doses at all.",Cyr

The worst thing about this drug is the crazy headache and nausea it gives me. I also can’t sleep at all cause everything is so itchy. But some drugs aren’t meant for everyone. I have also tried Seroquel and it made me really sleepy but after having slept for a few hours I felt so much better and in control of my emotions.,Anonymous

Sometimes the drugs would work for a short period of time, but would always lose efficacy in a short period of time. Was put on abilify injection 13 months ago, has not worn out and my mood remains stable and irritability  is at bay. It is very very hard to lose weight on this drug. I have a very restrictive diet with tons of excercise. Weight loss is very slow- but possible. This is the only side effect I have from the medication.",Siouxsie
21,Aripiprazole,Borderline Personality Disorder,10.0,,"July 7, 2018",25,"Wow. I did not think that any medicine would ever help me with my BPD. I have only been on it a little more than a month, but it's worked wonders. If it's going to help you, it may even start kicking in after 2 weeks or so. I feel so close to normal now. I am on an antidepressant too, but of course, it does nothing for my BPD. I was looking for a medication for my BPD that could lessen the intense symptoms, and give me a better base for my emotions that my brain just could not give me with this illness.  I knew that it could help with my parnaoia, but it has helped with that and so much more. I have not had a bad day on this medication. My emotions are in check, my ideation is gone, and it's really hard to have a bad day or be in a bad or negative mindset. I don't get stressed and flustered as easily. All my symptoms have been lessened or helped, it's been a wonder drug for me.",Kay

Not only is it super expensive, but I found It didn't work for me at all. When I first started taking it I was very sedated and tired. Eventually It had no side effects on me, but no positive ones either! My mood swings were constant and my outbursts weren't any less. Nobody in my immediate family who were aware of my BPD noticed a difference. It didn't work for me, But it is definitely worth a try because it doesn't have any major side effects like weight gain.

It has changed my life! My marriage was almost at the point of divorce due to my paranoia, questioning, accusations and general anger including violence. I have done not a single one of these since the first day I took this drug! I also had a very serious suicide attempt and have not wanted to do nothing like that since. It's a wonder drug, I thank God I found it. The only side effect I have is restlessness, during the day I cannot relax but at night I sleep perfectly.

Abilify has not helped my mood swings at all and am now working with Dr to come off.An overall low rating for Abilify to treat BPD as medications only manage the symptoms and not causes of BPD, I have since learned.

I have been on a lot of medications in the past, and nothing has worked as well as abilify for stabilizing my mood and reducing paranoia and anxiety. I get a pretty rare side effect called ocular gyric crisis so I take artane as well to counter the side effect and it works well. Although I have a horrible side effect from abilify I am still very happy with it. The only problem is that it is expensive and Medicaid refused to cover it unless I tried 3 other meds from the same family. I am on number 3 (I tried geodon and seroquel and they made me exhausted and am giving risprisol a go) but so far nothing has been as effective as abilify. I am hoping Medicaid will cover it soon.
