0,Lithium,Borderline Personality Disorder,10,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"March 11, 2022",0,"I’ve tried 20+ medications across all drug classes in the past 10 years. The meds either don’t work or I have awful responses to them. Until my doctor recommended lithium. Once we got to 300mg 2x a day, I felt a DRAMATIC difference. Overall I felt better, my strong BPD symptoms reduced- I feel like I can think more rationally before I overreact and it makes it easier to use my coping skills. I feel like I can pause when I’m triggered. And my depression is better. My lithium level at this dose is below therapeutic, my doctor said that low dose lithium has shown benefit. When we tried to increase it, I felt worse so we decreased it and I’m fine. No side effects except more thirsty which is to be expected with lithium. Make sure you keep up with blood work.Lithium has been the ONLY med to help me with minimal side effects.",Dakota
1,Lithium,Borderline Personality Disorder,10,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"October 5, 2021",4,"Lithium has helped me to handle my anxiety and anger, but it didn’t numb me out to the point where I couldn’t practice mindfulness or other DBT skills.",Bob
2,Lithium,Borderline Personality Disorder,10,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"July 19, 2021",3,"I have been on lithium (priadel) 800mg PM for 8 months, it has been absolutely amazing in keeping my mood fluctuations with my BPD in check, I used to go up and down 8-10 times a day but since I started taking this I haven't really had any downs or ups just the occasional dread, but I no longer feel suicidal! It's been a complete life changer. I wish I got on it sooner!",Crb
3,Lithium,Borderline Personality Disorder,9,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"March 5, 2021",8,"Lithium is the only drug I've ever taken that has reduced and almost eliminated my suicidal ideation. Don't get me wrong, my Borderline Personality Disorder BPD makes it very hard to control my impulses even while medicated, however I have not self harmed and have had no suicide attempts since starting lithium. I'm on 600 mg AM and PM, it has even helped me stay sober from alcohol and cocaine (coming up on 8 months now) I have gained about 50 pounds since then, but lithium is only a single factor in that. I have gotten less active and started eating a poorer diet since getting sober. Fact of the matter is, I finally know what it's like to live a life not wanting to kill myself 24/7. And it's a huge relief. There are drawbacks to it, but if you are struggling with suicidal thoughts, there is no better drug on the market.",madison
4,Lithium,Borderline Personality Disorder,1,,"March 3, 2021",10,"I only took 1000mg of Lithium for three months and I think it might have broken me for life. My emotions are numb and when I do feel I feel extremely dissociated from them, my hands still shake too. Before Lithium I drew every day, played guitar, wrote music, and read a new book every week. Since I took my first pill I haven't written a single song, haven't read a single book, and my art isn't what it used to be. I don't feel pleasure from anything in life anymore. I know it sounds outlandish but I am not exaggerating. Think very carefully before going on this stuff that they market as a pill.",eri

6,Lithium,Borderline Personality Disorder,3,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"March 10, 2020",20,"One other users' experience sounds exactly the same as mine, it was almost scary... I started lithium at the age of 18 after being diagnosed with bipolar II (and 4 years later rediagnosed Borderline with comorbid chronic depression and generalized anxiety) I don't remember much of 2012-2016 when I was on it, about 900mg of lithium, 100mg of pristiq and 100mg of welbutrin (I think). I didn't feel anything emotional which was a change from feeling everything so intensely all the time, I lost my entire personality, I gained about 60lbs over the course of 3 months. I finally decided after 4 years go off it, and it was the best decision I ever made.It wasn't for me, but it doesn't mean it's not for you... Downsides include massive weight gain, loss of personality, blood tests every 2-3 months to check toxicity level, memory loss...",Bpdbabe
7,Lithium,Borderline Personality Disorder,10,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"February 25, 2020",11,"Lithium worked for my BPD, combined with pregabalin, and occasionally Brintellix. This is in contrast to carbamazepine, fluoxetine, paroxetine, citalopram, Topamax and all of antipsychotics and tricyclics. I wish someone was smart enough to put me on it much sooner.",Reviewer x
8,Lithium,Borderline Personality Disorder,10,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"February 11, 2020",33,"Lithium is the one med I was absolutely terrified to take, but after failing on nearly every mood stabilizer, I was pretty much forced to give it a shot. I have borderline personality disorder as well as Bipolar 2, so medications for me can be very complicated to get right. I am happy to say that I've had virtually no side effects on Lithium and the results have been LIFE CHANGING. This is the only med that has ever reduced my self harm thoughts down to almost nothing, and my moods from both BPD and bipolar are greatly stabilized. It has also been a great help in controlling some of my impulsive behavior like shopping and drinking. The ONLY negative is that I have had some issues with my hypothyroidism since taking it, but we were able to get my meds adjusted and resolve that. Don't let Lithium scare you, if nothing else has worked it can literally save your life.",mb1992
9,Lithium,Borderline Personality Disorder,7,Taken for 5 to 10 years,"September 18, 2019",24,"I am more balanced when taking my lithium. Unlike what some have said, i  unfortunately experience the full range of my emotions. Fortunately, due to combo of wellbutrin & regular therapy I handle those emotions much better when taking my lithium. The times I didn't take lithium life was more challenging - I have borderline personality disorder.",Cakes
10,Lithium,Borderline Personality Disorder,1,Taken for less than 1 month,"April 25, 2017",17,"Took lithium carbonate. I have PTSD, depression, borderline bipolar.At first, it seemed like a wonder drug for about the first week. Then, out of nowhere, I experienced rapid cycling for the first time in my life. I screamed at the top of my lungs, felt like breaking things for catharsis (which I did on some very inexpensive items)Then after screaming in anger for about ten minutes, I immediately began crying for 30mins.Avoid lithium!!!",sk0sH

12,Lithium,Borderline Personality Disorder,7,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"July 22, 2013",59,"Didn't help win the emotional attachment aspect of Borderline Personality Disorder, but it definitely reduced my suicidal thoughts and self harm urges.",Lysse
13,Lithium,Borderline Personality Disorder,2,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"October 5, 2012",59,Turned me into a zombie and made me gain at least 60 pounds. Lithium completely numbed out my emotions until I could no longer function. I was on it for 3 years and nobody would take me off of it because I have adverse reactions to most mood stabilizers that could replace it and they viewed me having no moods at all as better than having symptomatic Borderline Personality Disorder. I barely have any memories from the time I was on lithium. I was eventually taken off it because it started driving me into rage.,Anonymous
