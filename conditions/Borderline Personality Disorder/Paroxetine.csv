0,Paroxetine,Borderline Personality Disorder,6,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"January 3, 2022",0,"I don't believe I've ever been correctly diagnosed.  I was originally diagnosed with anxiety, panic and depression. While very true I believe these are symptoms of something else or the bother symptoms I experience have gone overlooked.Many thing have been questioned including  Bipolar, BPD, undiagnosed ADHD etc.I was on Paxil as a teenager and I felt nothing. No anxiety and I don't recall any other emotions. When writing these reviews I take into account and I urge other to take into account the environment they were in while on the medication.  Ie, the medication will not solve the emotional issues of an abusive relationship or unhealthy home. At the age I was on Paxil I was on 15 and in a very very dysfunctional household but I can saying had little to no anxiety,  concern and really barely any thoughts at all ( that O remember). It's possible it made me aggressive but considering my environment I can't definitely say. I may explore this again",My experience
1,Paroxetine,Borderline Personality Disorder,8,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"September 5, 2021",2,"I got initial dose of 12.5mg . It worked in second month. It was extremely great. I felt like I was happy as I was in school days. I felt myself after decades of age. I thanked god a lot. When I told to my doctor, he made it 25mg . (It was as per drugs protocol in treatment of anxiety. At that time my diagnosis was of anxiety disorder. But now I think it must be bpd.) But then things turned horrible and my mental condition worsened, and I ended up doing something I shouldn't have.So, I would conclude that it is best drug if given in lower dose for treatment of bpd.",Sankobaad
