1,Lamotrigine,Borderline Personality Disorder,9.0,Taken for 5 to 10 years,"December 17, 2021",2,"I’ve been taking lamotrigine for over 5 years. Quite a low dosage, just 100-150mg a day split into two doses. No side effects. Has helped me considerably with Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD) and depression. Thanks to it I was able to get my emotions to settle down and work on myself in therapy to learn coping mechanisms for other symptoms. I am now able to have stable fullfilling relationships. It also keeps depression at bay, I am off antidepressants and haven’t had another depressive episode. On top of that I haven’t had a panic attack in years too.Therapy and lamotrigine have been a huge help. But it is not a magical cure, just a crutch to help you in therapy. Having a support system from family/friends/partners is still the most important thing.",Rebekah

Worsened my intrusive thoughts and impulse control issues. Dissociated constantly and had facial muscle movement issues. Was eventually taken off after 8 months.

9,Lamotrigine,Borderline Personality Disorder,8.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"August 22, 2021",1,"About 4 months ago started my BPDBorderline Personality Disorder  treatment using lamictal. Got up to 75mg and have been on that for some time. I have definitely noticed a change in specifically my suicidality and mood swings, which has been great help in my day to day functions and outlook on life. Unfortunately I am also experiencing some of the side affects, such as spots, drowsiness, and -most intensely/recently- nausea. The nausea has caused me to have a tough time meeting any real nutritional needs during my day, which is especially troublesome for a co-occurring ED, but I am working with it the best I can because in my mind, the positives are outweighing the negatives. The spots scared me because I thought it was a rash, but ended up just going away. Nausea/loss of appetite has really been the only impactful side effect I’ve had.",Js764

I experienced severe side effects, including increased depression, increased anxiety, a high fever, a sore throat, a brain fog, body aches, and a burning sensation on my skin that I can only describe as feeling like sunburn. I had to immediately discontinue use of Lamotrigine. I understand these are rare side effects that more than likely won't happen to most people, however it was unbearable for me.

I've also noticed that when I miss a dosage, I drop into much more of a depression so it must help stabilise my mood more than I realise. Overall very good medication with NO side effects for me.

I was very afraid of developing a rash so I wanted to add to this thread and say there is a 2mg tablet available. I see people starting on 25mg and going to 50mg then giving a bad review. I started Lamitrigine on 2.5mg. My symptoms before medicating are mood swings, anger, suicidal, anxious panic, depression. I have been diagnosed borderline personality disorder (BPD). I have previously tried Pristiq, Lexapro, Prozac (do NOT take Prozac if you are BPD and have anger symptoms as it makes it 100 times worse), Tegretol, Valium, Sodium Valporate, Queitapine and probably others but i think thats it. Tegrotol was the best thing that worked for me but i got the itchy blood side effect after 3 months on it. So i am trying this other mood stabiliser Lamitrigine from my own research.

Hope everyone before and after me here will eventually get better.I have severe BPD with predominant depressive/ suicidal episodes and anger.I'm also very anxious and anxiety gives me depersonalization episodes. So I was prescribed with lamotrigine as a mood stabilizer and it supposed to help with derealization episodes somehow.At first it seemed to work, depression was not that deep and derealization seemed to be gone like as I was a kid again. But eventually after three weeks I've noticed that it all got much worse depressive/ aggressive wise. I also started getting chills and shivering with headaches. Last thing I wanted to add - don't mix it with anything like weed or alcohol.My MD said I may smoke, but when I did I had severe panic attacks and something that felt like psychosis.To be clear , I smoke occasionally for 5 years already and I've never got such feelings from weed.",sh1nob1

However, the DAY of taking Lamotrigine my emotions just calmed down. My life has improved exponentially. I feel like I can have a family, a career, a stable relationship, and haven't been ""on the edge"". I know studies say it doesn't work for us. I disagree because this is my miracle drug. Other meds didn't work for me, so my psych recommended lamotrigine. If you feel like you're watching a monster take over your life and you're just there for the ride: I recommend this. If you feel like your emotions take control of your body: I recommend this.Negatives: Numb for the first week. Felt like I didn't love anyone? That's gone now.Oil production: Worst acne of my life.

I got Wellbutrin XL 150mg, which helped but made me super angry, my doctor then added in Lamictal 100mg (starting from the lowest dose and gradually increasing) and it cancelled out the anger they Wellbutrin caused and the two work phenomenally well  for me. Like a lot of people on here they say they felt the effects immediately, I can vouch for that. It put my brain into a zen state and I got my laid back nature back. Mind you this only worked for me along with seeing a therapist and working out constantly.

28,Lamotrigine,Borderline Personality Disorder,2.0,,"August 7, 2020",21,"Lamotrigine sounded like a great drug at first, it doesn't affect your sexual health, it doesn't make you emotionally numb, and I imagine it helps a lot of people. PLEASE DON'T LET THIS SCARE YOU But unfortunately, for me, according to my doctor it had a very bad reaction once I moved up to 100mg that unfortunately landed me in hospital and rendered me unable to function properly for the next two weeks. It was due to my genetic profile and medication sensitivity that caused my body to reject the drug, If you are sensitive to higher doses to medication generally or get extreme anxiety with your borderline I highly recommend getting pharmacogenomic testing or a genetic profile for the medication (in Australia it is not that expensive) before taking this medication. What happened to me was rare but can happen, and I don't want anyone else to go through what I went through But in saying this please don't be scared to try this medication, because it has worked wonders for so many people.",FireFerret

I read a lot of others people reviews saying if you can push past this initial stage your body will adjust to it, and what do you know  it took about six days to get over the initial side effects from lamotrigine. I feel WAY more balanced out, I am not over thinking, and the things that used to worry me or give me anxiety no longer do. I don't hold on to the negative obsessive thoughts like i used to. If something upsets me I am able to take a step back and look at the whole picture without blowing up. I realize it takes 6 weeks to reach full potential but oh my wow must I say I see and feel a difference within myself. I am going to keep taking this medication, as I can see its potential to change my life, the way I feel about myself, the way I feel and interact with others, and my whole outlook on things in general.

This medication literally saved my life. If you do go on this medication, I must warn you that the change is very dramatic and adjusting to normal is very foreign and scary for a while - especially if you have been this way for a long time. Therapy is an absolute must. Talking through your problems, past and present, learning new coping skills and just having that support will help tremendously. I know you probably feel like it’s impossible to change because it’s all you know, I get it, but life can be good.

Combined with Prozac (fluoxetine) which I also slowly worked my way up to 50mg. It is saving me in so many ways. No more extreme lows, impulsiveness, I think before I act, anger has subsided, anxiety is slowly creeping away, no suicidal thoughts, no crying at nothing, not up and down like a yoyo throughout the day. I have been on every medication for BPD and my panic disorder/ anxiety. This is the only one that has worked with no weight gain. Initial sleepiness, slight nausea and diarrhea as side effects. But it subsides If you push through. Thank goodness for this mood stabilising medication.",Indigo

It felt awesome not having a care in the world towards things that would typically panic me and send me into an episode. Unfortunately, I removed myself from the medication once I realized that all of the symptoms that I was experiencing were the severe side effects of lamotrigine. I had everything but the rash. If I had stayed on it any longer, it would have killed me.",Julie Honn

I'd like to know what it actually does,  scientifically,  but it feels it almost gives me time to think before snapping.  I'm still not 100% but even my partner, friends and work have noticed a difference in myself.

55,Lamotrigine,Borderline Personality Disorder,9.0,,"September 14, 2017",51,"Started taking lamictal when I started DBT earlier this year, and noticed almost immediately that my intense mood swings had largely subsided. Some classic BPD symptoms haven't been resolved (for me, feelings of insecurity/abandonment and argumentativeness) and I still struggle with suicidal ideation and target behaviors. However, the intensity and frequency of these episodes have diminished greatly. Lamictal has really improved my life and I think I would be in a drastically worse position without taking it. I haven't have any weight gain on this medication or any other negative side effects. I would definitely recommend this medication!

56,Lamotrigine,Borderline Personality Disorder,2.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"September 10, 2017",17,I started lamotrigine as per my psychiatrist to stabilize my anger and agitation from BPD. I tapered up slowly and had no issues with a rash. The more I took it and the higher the dose went I noticed it was helping more and more with my anger and agitation but not with depression or suicidal thoughts. I was crying daily after months on it and could not feel any happiness or positive emotions although it was helping with outbursts for sure. That's when the physical side effects began. I developed severe painful cystic acne whereas before I had fairly clear skin. This was some deep painful acne that was so painful I could not touch my own face and have to now be on antibiotics for months which is another story. I now have nerve damage at 24,Kacutie

I also haven't gained any weight from it. (I was originally on Zyprexa and had gained 50 pounds) In fact, Lamictal has helped me lose weight and stabilize my weight. I love this medication so much because life is 1000x more manageable and I never knew I could feel this way. I was so close to ending my life and this medication saved me along with learning DBT skills. However, it was really uncomfortable until I got stabilized on the 150mg. Going up to 200mg also made me too numb. I recommend this medication most definitely as someone who has gone through the awful trial and error of testing medications.",Diagnosed with BPD/Bi Polar

Since November 2014, I was unable to get up and act like a normal human being. With suicidal ideations and one attempt. I was sleeping 24/7. I was unable to cope in a realistic manner. I had lost all hope, all joy, all energy, all motivation. Until 2 weeks ago. My insurance got changed so Latuda was no longer an option. I asked my doctor to put me on Geodon and Lamictel again. I slept 24/7 the first week, then some miracle happened. I started feeling alive and had energy and my mood was fantastic. To say my life has changed positively is an understatement. I am a normal acting person again. Only problem is weight gain. I think from Geodon.",Shalie
