0,Bupropion,Borderline Personality Disorder,10,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"February 26, 2022",2,"End of Life experience with Borderline Personality mother, with narcissistic tendencies.  She developed dementia heavily colored by her BPD.  Her reasoning and logic abilities diminished greatly along with certain memory issues.  But her powers of communication and manipulation remained Oscar worthy, even tho she’d forget what lies she told to whom. If her inconsistency was pointed out she’d rage.  She truly loved being as cruel as possible to people when angry.  Anger was frequent, tantrums embarrassing & infantile but terrifying.  Then diagnosed with terminal cancer. The meds to calm elderly agitated patients made her more agitated. Several meds tried. Her mood swings so frequent & extreme was like having 4 different patients. Finally requested  Wellbutrin/Bupropion out of desperation.  It made a big difference, helped other meds to work better bringing relief to her anxiety, anger, tantrums and sanity back to us.  Her swings were less dramatic & frequent.",Janet
1,Bupropion,Borderline Personality Disorder,10,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"November 18, 2021",2,"Wellbutrin saved my life. I have borderline personality disorder, Wellbutrin makes it easier for me to not let every tiny thing affect me and to not dwell as much on one bad topic as I used to before. My mood definitely improved. Shaking like crazy for the first two weeks, no bad symptoms after; except going to the toilet. I am even more constipated than I used to be damn.",Cari
