1,Risperidone,Borderline Personality Disorder,1.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"March 17, 2022",0,"My sister took this for 3 years, starting at age 66, after he rBorderline Personality Disorder  BPD rages got out of control and this turned her into an emotionless robot. Her personality completely disappeared and she’s just ‘flat’ all the time. The rages are gone, but so is she! She’s contented to spend her entire day in her bedroom and has no need of companionship. It’s like she doesn’t care about people anymore—even her own family! She had tardive dyskinesia for a year after discontinuing it, but her personality never came back. It’s like she has no emotional needs anymore. Worse still, she looks blank and doesn’t answer for a long time if you ask a question, and her cognitive processing is severely compromised. She has a PhD, but now it’s like ‘nobody’s home’ half the time. She just lives inside herself and she’s fine with that.",mev
2,Risperidone,Borderline Personality Disorder,1.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"January 18, 2022",0,"I was given Risperidone for my Borderline Personality Disorder and Schizophrenia. I can't remember my exact dosage but it was increased overtime and it worsened my mental state. I'd heard before that it would help my mental instability and mood swings along with helping me regulate myself mentally overall. It did not help me and the strongest side effect I got from it was the increased appetite. I went from 60kg to 78kg in 3 months. I was constantly eating even when I wasn't hungry and I couldn't stop, even when I wanted to. I was eating until I was sick and even though I didn't want to at all and was painfully full, my brain would just tell me to get more and more because of the increased appetite. It is impossible to fight your appetite.I had to be taken off it because it was making me worse but I was still left with an increased appetite and habit of overeating even after I was long gone off it. I do not recommend it, ever.",Morgan
3,Risperidone,Borderline Personality Disorder,9.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"December 21, 2021",0,It just makes me very tired.  I got it  from the mental hospital that I have come back from. It kinda changes my persona and makes me more upbeat and less energetic it helps me focus on the experience that I'm writing. It goes hand and hand with night time when I wanna sleep,gus_lowkey
4,Risperidone,Borderline Personality Disorder,2.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"November 21, 2021",0,"I was prescribed risperidone in 2018, after being on Quetiapine for  Borderline Personality Disorder (BDP) diagnosis (was misdiagnosed instead of ocd and adhd). I am completely aware that different drugs affect everyone different, so if it works for you great! However this is probably one of the medications I would give everyone who takes it a strong warning about! The effects of risperidone hospitalised me 5 times as it was only on the last visit we worked out it was the tablets. It caused this muscle dystonia which came on suddenly and caused all of my muscles to seize up uncontrollably, caused my head to bend completely backwards, my tongue to stick out, arms and legs cramping up. The best way to describe how it looked was as if I was having an exorcism. It was agonisingly, painful and embarrassing as I couldn’t get help for hours as my body had contorted so badly I couldn’t move to call help. It took a high dose of lorazepam and other medications to calm it a bit until it was out of my system.",LLL666
5,Risperidone,Borderline Personality Disorder,9.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"September 9, 2021",0,"When I first started I gained a lot of weight. However after changing my diet it calmed down and I started loosing again. It works really well for most all my side effects, dissociation, delusions, aggression and depression. Just be very careful of what foods you eat and try to stick to a healthy diet. I was suddenly able to go throughout the day without the urge to hurt myself for almost the first time in my life. Truly great.",Melen
6,Risperidone,Borderline Personality Disorder,9.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"August 25, 2021",1,"I was on this medication as a child I had ADHD my psych tried to get me sectioned however my mother refused. This medication slowed me right down no more anger, mood swings, it wasn't all great as it made me like a zombie for a while. I'm 23 now it gave me a head twitch that’s on going to this day but I’d rather have a twitch than what I was going through.  But now I'm an adult and I'm deciding to go on it again, this time my dr says I have bpd, panic disorder. I have several panic attacks daily it’s awful I can’t take antidepressants as they set of my mania and I’m currently on pregabalin for my anxiety.  So risperidone is my final option and I was very reluctant to take it due to the risks it comes with and I have terrible health anxiety but I need to choose quality over quantity of life. I've sat and read all these comments about the medication and they’re not wrong when you first start the medication it’s hard but the light at the end of the tunnel is the best feeling",Kiah

8,Risperidone,Borderline Personality Disorder,1.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"April 15, 2021",0,"I have ASPD and was prescribed risperidone to help my aggression and homicidal thoughts (no idea how an antipsychotic was supposed to help) Anyway, all the pills did really was give me super dry mouth, boner problems, made me extra irritable, and dizzy, and weak all the time for no reason at all. I would occasionally see things that weren't there (before I started the pills) but after I started taking them it stopped, so I guess it fixed one thing, but overall it was bad. Take this if you really absolutely need it, and don't miss your dose. I missed two days once and I wigged out mad. 0.5/10",Mike Hunt

I have been taking Risperidone for 6 years now  and I have found that it does work to a degree, stabilizing my moods.But it does the job so well that all positive emotions are suppressed as well.I have decided to come off it and see what it's like to feel again, for better or for worse.",BrianMc
15,Risperidone,Borderline Personality Disorder,1.0,,"April 11, 2017",10,"Took this medication for 4 months it didn't do much but help me sleep. I experienced lactation, enlarged breasts ""went from a B cup to a Double D""  hunger to the point that I never felt full no matter what I ate, obsessive sweating, and the worst thing was that I gained 40lbs in 4 months. I was originally 130lbs and topped off at 170lbs and flushed the remaining medication and had zero withdrawals. Unfortunately this was 3 years ago and no matter what I do I can not lose more than 10lbs and I gain it back off and on. I am getting my thyroid tested to check if it caused it to be come inactive or under active. Because I have never weighed more than 135lbs even after having 3 Full term babies. This Medication should be removed from the market!!!",MedicationGuinniPig4real!
16,Risperidone,Borderline Personality Disorder,1.0,,"November 28, 2016",13,"With this medication, which I was on for a month at 0.5 mg, I felt nauseous constantly, I felt feverish, and I gained 10 pounds without having much of an appetite. I developed restless legs, shaking and tremors. At one point, I fainted and fell to the floor shaking. It never relieved any of my symptoms. It was only like taking a pill that made me sick. Now, I'm not saying this isn't the right medication for YOU, only that it had these adverse effects on me.",EmilyJo32y6

20,Risperidone,Borderline Personality Disorder,1.0,,"August 23, 2011",25,"My 5 year old son was given this medication for anger associated with ADHD. He started on 0.5 mg and it worked right away. He was better able to control his anger and frustration. I started noticing what I thought were tics which we attributed to a stimulant (and so discontinued that) but kept him on the Risperidone. In fact, the psychiatrist increased his dosage to 1 mg. While the medicine worked in terms of his anger/frustration, he developed a very scary side effect: tardive dyskinesia. I stopped the medicine rather abruptly because of the abnormal movements and we went through a grueling two weeks or so of withdrawal. I know this medicine has some positive effects, but please use with caution.",Anonymous
