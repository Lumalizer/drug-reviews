0,Alprazolam,Borderline Personality Disorder,9,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"April 9, 2020",20,"Alprazolam has been a life saver for me due to PTSD. I experience anxiety, depression, BPD symptoms,  which I think all run in the family, plus due to severe childhood & adult traumas.My dose of alprzolam  I take is 1 mg 3 x day. I have struggled with addiction issues with substances before & if I drink too much alcohol with alprazolam it can cause bad side effects for me. But if taken as prescribed & try to incorporate it with counseling, healthy diet & exercise, & little or no alcohol, alprazolam can be highly therapeutic for many. I feel Xanax generics can sometimes vary in effectiveness so check different pharmacies if you feel a generic is not working well enough for you!",Luna
