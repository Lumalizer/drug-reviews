3,Quetiapine,Borderline Personality Disorder,9.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"October 25, 2021",3,"I have been prescribed Seroquel previously to deal with post-breakup Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD) breakdown. It helped, but once I recovered I couldn't deal with the sleepiness side effect and I stayed on an SSRI for a couple of years.  Recently I got diagnosed with possible ADHD as well and boy am I glad I told my doctor to try Seroquel again.I was started on Brintellix for general depression/focus and Seroquel for BPD symptom management and finally I feel like an actual person and not just a shell of myself. I used to have a tendency to hurt others verbally, be angry, break stuff, break down afterwards crying. Seroquel helps, but I had to accept the fact that it would make me sleepy at first. I slept off the initial stage of ""I can't get wake up"" and take it strictly in the evening at least 10-12 hours before I have to get up. A coffee wakes me up after about an hour without issues now. I am very happy with Seroquel :)",Anonymous
4,Quetiapine,Borderline Personality Disorder,8.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"September 18, 2021",0,"I’ve been on and off seroquel ever since I was diagnosed with borderline personality disorder in 2017. I was diagnosed at 17 and I’m 21 now. I started on 25mg and got increased steadily to 100mg from 2017-2019. I quit taking my meds several times over the years bc nothing was working and I attempted suicide 5 times in 2 years. In 2020 I got back on seroquel, only seroquel, on 50mg. It has helped reduce my mood swings, impulsivity, paranoia, and psychosis. I am able to sleep so well when I take it. When I miss dosages bc I run out, the withdrawals feels like I am dying, I cannot sleep or eat, the psychosis is absolutely horrendous, I have horrible headaches, and restless leg. I was just increased to 100mg from 50mg bc I had a psychotic episode and the only issue so far is my heart is racing for about an hour after I take it which makes my paranoia worse. It has only been 2 days on 100mg so hopefully it evens out. But I feel good on this medication it is the only thing that works.",Nessie

I take it alongside adderall XR and prosozin. It seems to be the best med combo I've been on. My anxiety has been cut down significantly, this medication works better than benzodiazipenes which I do not want to take. My impulsiveness has been cut down significantly, I sleep better, act better, feel better, function better all of it. No weight gain for me, as I watch what I eat. only thing is be ready for some CRAZY DREAMS, and I mean crazy. Life changing med yall.",Crod8309

8,Quetiapine,Borderline Personality Disorder,7.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"April 4, 2021",7,"Well I started on 25mg and it was okay but I would still feel extreme rages, soo I went up to 50mg. It did help me a lot, I realised that things that I would usually overthink weren’t actually that big of a deal.I was continually having relationship problems soo I started going up until 100mg. And now I’ve realised that it’s not actually helping that much. I’m not as emotional and wild as I was, and I can see a positive, but I feel like I miss the old me! I miss feeling everything and expressing myself with real emotions. Now I feel more motivated, but I don’t feel like me any more. I’m more quiet and I still get the rage, I still get upset and overwhelmed, just not as much. It does work, but I’m gaining soo much weight and I want to be the old me. Maybe with some therapy when Covid is over and try something else, but I’m going to slowly drop downs to 25mg and then come off of it because I don’t want to be on this for years.",I. C
9,Quetiapine,Borderline Personality Disorder,7.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"February 6, 2021",10,"I found the low doses of 25mg, 50mg, 75mg slow to adjust to but overwhelmingly positive after a while I found that 75mg was no longer as effective so moved to 100mg.I have a very fairly fast metabolism so I often have an intense reaction to medicine and drugs.I tried 125mg for 4 days and I started having shakes, 3 hour adrenaline rush, constant moving, suicidal thoughts, intense uncontrollable rage/anger.Reduced my dose back to 100mg and all side effects have disappeared.In general I feel much better within myself. My mood ranges have become far less turbulent and I am slightly less irritable in general.Will continue to to monitor and maybe reduce again to 75mg.",Ragin Fumin
10,Quetiapine,Borderline Personality Disorder,10.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"February 1, 2021",74,"I’ve been taking 25mg of Quetiapine at night for a month. Was wary of the weight gain, however have not gained any weight. I do watch what I eat and walk for around 30mins-1hr everyday. I think it’s best to take it at night as it does make you very sleepy and do feel some slight hunger, so best to take at night to avoid urges to eat/over eat. In terms of mental health, it’s completed changed my life, I went from crying for hours a days by torturing myself with overthinking, to just finally being able to feel grounded and live my life like a ‘normal’ person. I haven’t changed and I’m not ‘doped’ out all the time as some people may imagine when someone takes a drug like this. I actually feel positive about my life and it’s allowed me to have some hope for overcoming BPD, or manage my symptoms. I would definitely recommend this drug, however I am aware people have different reactions, but for me it’s been very beneficial and I hope my review can help someone else too",Sarah
11,Quetiapine,Borderline Personality Disorder,10.0,,"January 27, 2021",31,"I have been diagnosed with Borderline personality disorder (BPD). I’m 20. I was depressed and suicidal when my psychiatrist put me on seroquel. Itook 4-5 months for it to fully kick in. 300mg was too much for me my mornings were horrible and I fainted a couple of times. my heart was beating so fast when I woke up and I would get so dizzy it was so hard to start my days properly. I wouldn’t go back to 300mg - also made me feel like a potato, because I never felt sad anymore.  I am now taking 150mg which is working soooo well for me. I am finally happy and I have reached a point of emotional stability and consciousness which I have never had previously. It makes me feel like I have seen the real life on the other side. I was so blinded due to bpd and  now seroquel - only (no dialect treatment) made me feel so confident and the person I’ve always been looking for. I’ve been on it for 9 months and I can’t imagine my life without it. I might be addicted to it but IDC - I  would never go back to my bpd it scares into the thought of living in that nightmare.",cb1617

I've only just overcome that fact really, From the start I felt extremely High or Sedated (I was prescribed quetiapine for hallucinations and night terrors, I started on 75mg and I'm currently on 250mg and over the years despite the start up side effects from 2-4 weeks maybe 6 weeks for some people, it is still a brilliant drug for my BPD and PTSD.

13,Quetiapine,Borderline Personality Disorder,3.0,,"November 20, 2020",3,"I have mixed feelings about this drug. I was originally on 75mg of Quetiapine for about 3 years for insomnia and it helped massively getting to sleep but it made me feel as though I had a hangover the next day. I have currently been an inpatient for the last 4 months and it was increased up to 400mg, this is when the major side effects came into play. First side effect that was very apparent was weight gain: I went from about 65kg to 80kg in the space of 2 months. As well as it being obvious I put on weight it also made my hands and face swell. Another side effect was not being able to stay awake, if you are to take this drug I suggest taking it on a night and not throughout the day as it makes you very sedative. The major side effect to me was my pulse, about an hour after taking the medication my heart rate rocketed to about 160bpm, luckily I was in hospital at the time so a DR saw me straight away and I was taken off the drug.",Lux08

16,Quetiapine,Borderline Personality Disorder,10.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"July 31, 2020",34,I'm a 23 y/o woman diagnosed with borderline personality disorder at age 18. I take 25mg quetiapine once daily and this medication has gotten my psychotic symptoms under control as well as getting my co-morbid generalized anxiety disorder under control. I also take .25mg xanax as needed for spikes of anxiety and it works like a charm! I used to not be able to sleep through the night without waking up hallucinating and it was a nightmare. Now I actually sleep and during the day it's made my psychotic symptoms completely go away. The only con I've noticed is the morning grogginess but that's eased as I've gotten used to the medication. I absolutely recommend this for anyone with BPD specifically struggling with psychotic symptoms.,Venus
17,Quetiapine,Borderline Personality Disorder,10.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"July 1, 2020",58,"I have been on Seroquel for 5 years now. I began at 100mg and and just recently moved to 200mg. Prior to Seroquel, my BPD symptoms were out of control. I was misdiagnosed many times over my lifetime and have been given countless drugs for depression and anxiety, which either did not work or made things worse. Since being on Seroquel, my life has completely turned around. I feel totally in control of my thoughts, emotions, and actions. I feel rational and sane, have impulse control, have been able to hold down a job and maintained a nice lifestyle and marriage for the entire time, which I was never able to do before. I take it at bedtime, it's the ONLY thing that helps me sleep at night, I wake in the morning feeling rested and alert. I do struggle with being overweight by about 40lbs, but the benefits far outweigh the weight side effect for me.",CMac

I found the tablet to help my mental condition as my personality has changed following my brain haemorrhage. However my overwhelming concern was the weight that I had gained 4 stone! So in December 2019 I gradually started to reduce my dosage and now I only take 200mg at bedtime as it helps me to sleep as I wouldn’t be able to sleep without taking the Quetiapine.,Gaz.

21,Quetiapine,Borderline Personality Disorder,7.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"April 29, 2020",15,"I’m currently on 50 mg of Seroquel. It has helped a lot with psychotic symptoms related to BPD (borderline personality disorder), I haven’t had auditory hallucinations on it at this dose. It’s also helped boost my appetite which I was struggling with. The drowsiness made morning classes difficult since I was put on it while attending college, but overall I’d say the side effects are preferable to the symptoms the Seroquel is treating. It also seems to help taper down my impulsiveness.",Timy

25,Quetiapine,Borderline Personality Disorder,1.0,,"February 14, 2020",33,"Firstly, when I began this medication, I thought it was a godsend. I was prescribed it while in a behavioral health center and went from waking multiple times a night to sleeping a solid 8 hours and waking mostly refreshed, once the grogginess stepped aside. My mood evened out and my will to live was finally there. I was happy. I have been on this medication since November and it is now February and things have gone from wonderful, to complete rock bottom. My anxiety is through the roof and I've even developed false memory syndrome which has caused rampant paranoia in my waking life. I no longer sleep through the night because I'm jarred by horrifying nightmares built around my OCD intrusive thoughts and deep fears. I'm exhausted, depressed, and have absolutely no appetite anymore. It also has since caused me a lot of physical symptoms like severe nausea, body twitches, and diarrhea nearly every day. The honeymoon phase is over and I am miserable.",Dylan

46,Quetiapine,Borderline Personality Disorder,5.0,,"March 12, 2018",5,"I was originally prescribed quetiapine 25mg for sleep as an add-on to my other meds when I was in hospital. My understanding is that under about 100mg it has no effect other than as an alpha-histamine blocker, which is essentially the same as benadryl. For antipsychotic effect, a larger dose is needed, and for sleep, the side effects seem to outweigh the benefit vs., for example, benadryl itself. Having said that, since there has been some benefit shown at higher doses for BDP, someone with this condition likely has nothing to lose to take it at 25 or 50mg. Others have mentioned that it aggravates their restless legs syndrome, and it does the same for me - but 300mg of gabapentin easily takes care of that, and 300 or 600 works great for RLS regardless. The other issue I have with quetiapine is heartburn but for that I have an Rx for generic Zantac which works like a charm. I can't speak to the benefits of ""therapeutic level"" doses of quetiapine as I have never been on more than 50mg.",William

I increase my dose every time I trigger acutely and it calms me down. Drawback are I get hypotension from the XL, meaning I feel feint, dizzy and nauseas multiple times a day.

I'm on 600mg of the XR version nightly. It took a nearly 2 months for me to notice an effect but once it did take effect there was a great difference. I went from being incredibly low with repeated drinking, self harm & hospital admissions to a deep stability I haven't experienced in years. I've not self harmed now for 3 months & also quit drinking alcohol. My mood is on very much an even keel with no extreme highs & lows. I'm just happy at a normal level & enjoying life & am dealing with things so much better. Only negative is slight weight gain but it's a price I'm willing to pay for this stability.",Broken mind

If I drop down to 300mg I become unstable in my mood again. This medication has helped me become stable, I rarely become ""high"", due to this I have not self-harmed in a year and 6 months.The weight gain has made me uncomfortable, especially considering that the medication can make me very hungry. However, my weight has now stabilized and I ave a BMI of 28, so its not too bad. I still become very angry sometimes, but attribute this to my own behaviour and coping mechanisms.Overall, this has given me my life back.

Quetiapine helps me get to sleep but doesn't knock me out for as long as before. I average 8 hours per night, but still tend to have an afternoon nap. The gnawing anxiety only returns for short periods when under a lot of stress. The downside to quetiapine? I wonder if it makes me unable to empathize.

I was also prescribed Cymbalta for depression but have just ditched that because I was too fearless and suicidal on it.  Whilst Seroquel is not touching my depression, I noticed that after taking it I felt that I gained a degree of self-control back which helped me to start to use basic life skills that I have learnt, which help me to deal with some of the BPD approaches to life's problems.
