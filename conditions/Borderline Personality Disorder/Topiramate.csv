0,Topiramate,Borderline Personality Disorder,5.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"March 14, 2022",1,"I was using this for years but noticed it blocked my sexual response, meaning I was very numb downstairs. It also made me very forgetful and if you drink alcohol with this it makes you even more forgetful! If I went out with friends I was always losing my bag or phone, something I've never done before - personal belongings are usually glued to me when I'm out. I did feel it worked to begin with but, after a few years, things happened in my life and then I had more triggers because of this, and then the medication stopped working altogether. When I came off it I actually felt better. So overall, very confused about this drug. I'm currently feeling worse again not using anything at the moment and not sure what to do next. My doctor wants me to go back on this drug but not sure I want to.",Em33
1,Topiramate,Borderline Personality Disorder,1.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"December 31, 2021",1,"You got to be really careful taking this. Make sure you are taking it for the right reasons please. I’m a high functioning borderline: working out 5 times a week, signed with a well known modeling agency, I’m on the Dean’s list at my college. This medication completely ruined me and the girl I was. I don’t feel enjoyment in anything anymore. Before when I would be in my highs and a bit compulsive, I could to control myself; now I don’t even have fun hanging out with friends, eating my favorite foods, listening to my favourite music. Warning if you are very active, stay away. I’m now so weak in the gym; it’s impossible to fuel myself for my workouts because I crave nothing. I was given the medication because I model (no weight gain). I usually would be squatting 250lbs but I haven’t been able to push it and it’s very discouraging (thanks pills). I’ve always had borderline but now I’m dealing with depression",Liv
2,Topiramate,Borderline Personality Disorder,10.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"January 11, 2021",11,"I was placed on this medication topiramate and it helped me with my borderline personality disorder! I was able to function better and it assisted with mood and irritation. The side effects at first were difficult, however it got easier. I was on 50mg daily.",PMR2020
3,Topiramate,Borderline Personality Disorder,10.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"December 13, 2020",15,"This medication has been a game changer.  After trying so many medications (SSRI, SNRI, and then working my way through the mood stabilizers) Topamax has completely changed the way I think - I no longer pick at my skin. I feel very calm. I don't feel like I'm going I will lose my life every time I leave my house.  I did experience some cognitive issues for the first few weeks, but those side effects have subsided and I am now thinking clearer. I attribute this to perhaps not being consumed by fear and anxiety. Loss of taste has definitely been an annoying side effect - I miss tasting salty and sweet foods - this has resulted in a 20lb weight loss.",Jill

6,Topiramate,Borderline Personality Disorder,2.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"May 13, 2020",6,"I did not notice any emotional or behavioral changes I took topiramate for years. It gave me memorable and intense nightmares to the point I had panic attacks in my sleep, I remembered my nightmares vividly. I was told this would help with migraines, behaviors like intense emotional swings, also with weight loss. It may have helped me lose weight but I was doing a lot of over things to lose weight so hard to say. I would recommend trying but really watch if it helps or not, and if your side effects are worse than the supposed or help that it gives you.",KK
7,Topiramate,Borderline Personality Disorder,1.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"December 22, 2019",16,"My doctor told me there’s no actual pill for BPD so it was a long shot to try this drug.  I wanted to love it like everyone else, but I had the most god awful side effects.  My hands and feet become painfully numb and tingly like I sat on them and they fell asleep and it also gave me a weird, phegmy, deep cough.  I’ve heard such good things and everybody’s body chemistry is different and my body did not get along with this drug at all.  Nope, nope,  I’ll never take this drug again!",Driskey

11,Topiramate,Borderline Personality Disorder,10.0,,"May 10, 2018",52,"I have been on many meds for bpd and nothing worked. I was suicidal daily. I was on a cocktail of meds which wasn't helping so I just stopped them all. I did not feel better or worse. As with most days I was calling the suicide helpline. I was going to work every day. My manager would not allow me to go on the sick leave. My therapist was urging me to call in sick saying I wasn't  in any state to hold down a job. I was still taking my sleeping meds 5 pills which I take the minute I get home from work every day so I sleep until 5 next morning. I was so depressed, anxious, suicidal, I can't bear the evenings and weekends which are just hours of crying and self harming. I found this site and read about topimax, I put it to my doctor. We tried 50mg for my bulimia which I do as self harm It helped. I told my doctor that maybe if we upped the dose it may help as a mood stabiliser. To cut a long story short I'm on 200mg in the morning and 200mg in the evening, just this is my 3rd day and already I feel a difference :)",andrea198
12,Topiramate,Borderline Personality Disorder,10.0,,"August 6, 2017",35,"This drug is a game changer ! I'm coping daily much better...  I was a mess, suicidal a roller coaster of instability and terrible migraines, so far so good. I'm in a place where Dialectical behavior therapy (dbt) can at least sink in ....  I'm hoping not to much weight loss cause I'm tiny to begin with. But no side effects so far.",Yahs girl

Not a bright idea for someone with anxiety. I have mild anxiety. Racing negative thoughts. Took it 3 days, still have issues months later.",pmbourque

16,Topiramate,Borderline Personality Disorder,4.0,,"July 6, 2016",15,"Personally this drug helped my mood swings greatly, however I was quite disturbed that it agitated my diet as much as it did. I have a co-morbid eating disorder which was agitated by the med. The Topirimate made it so I HAD to eat my food a very specific way. Something soft, yet crunchy at the same time. Normally I wouldnt complain, however it was always on my mind.I think the hardest thing about the med was the appetite suppression for me. I was down to eating one meal a day, which ultimately let to me not loosing any weight which I can say was very difficult for me. I had increased irritability, and I felt overly fatigued. I am also on Citalopram, which is a terrible combination if you're prone to fatigue.",Kinkymink
