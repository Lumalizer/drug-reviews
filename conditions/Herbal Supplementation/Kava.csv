0,Kava,Herbal Supplementation,9,,"March 18, 2012",36,I have taken Kava Kava in 10-mg capsules for insomnia because I work shift work and have trouble relaxing when I need to at times.  I buy powdered root from a reputable company and put it in gel caps.  It works very well for me and I have been taking it for years with nothing detrimental to report.  I have taken melatonin in the past but then had periods after where I couldn't sleep without it.  I sleep fine on my days off without taking Kava and have never awoke drowsy.,Anonymous
