0,Prednisone,Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia,10,Taken for less than 1 month,"January 25, 2021",1,Prednisone works the best yet maintains a bad rap for no real reason.   What is so strange is that doctors seem to be scared to use this drug.  For Chemo they are not going to save one more minute of your life by avoiding it.  For chronic Bronchitis or asthma some doctors will try everything but Prednisone which can land you in the ER.  With Prednisone 3 or 4 days and your problem is gone.,Nickle
