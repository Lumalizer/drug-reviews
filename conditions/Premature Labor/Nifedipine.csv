0,Nifedipine,Premature Labor,4,Taken for less than 1 month,"July 31, 2021",0,"Baby born 32 weeks and 3 days.  I started having bad headaches by the 3rd day. I had swelling in the common places but my neck still feels swollen. Anyway, I was put on Nifedipine ER 30mg at 2 weeks and 1 day postpartum my blood pressure was high. I am having side effects which comes on in the late afternoon hours last till almost 10:30 pm to 11 pm, it all depends. Heart rate is up, headaches,   muscle cramps in legs, and my neck is also being effected. I'm seeing my obgyn this week coming. My blood pressure has been normal with the medication, but I can stand the side effects. I'm hoping I can get off this medication and my blood pressure stays normal now.",Myst
1,Nifedipine,Premature Labor,9,Taken for less than 1 month,"September 16, 2019",2,"Was hospitalized for 3 days at 32 weeks after showing signs of preterm labor. During hospital stay, was administered magnesium sulfate. Before discharged, was weaned off magnesium and put on nifedipine. Had horrible shakes for around 30 mins during the transition, but no major adverse event afterwards. Taking 10mg Q6H and have not experienced any contractions for over a week. Doctors are confident baby can go full-term if I continue on the med.",Panda
2,Nifedipine,Premature Labor,1,Taken for less than 1 month,"July 19, 2019",6,"I was prescribed this RX to help with a TTT situation with with my twins. After taking the med the first time it literally felt like fire in my throat and would not stop along with my heart racing and feeling my pulse in my ears. I took it a second time in the hospital and same side effects but this time it dropped my BP so low I actually passed out. The last dose taken was at 930 am and it is currently 930 pm and still have the heart thumping with feeling my pulse in my ears. This med is awful! I never have any issues with medication, but this one my body could not tolerate.",Cbrimmer
3,Nifedipine,Premature Labor,1,Taken for less than 1 month,"December 29, 2016",19,I was given this medication at 36 weeks of pregnancy because they tried to stop the contractions. My doctor suggested this medication as a last resort. I was admitted a week later with no fetal heartbeat. Subsequently this medication stop the blood flow to the placenta ultimately causing my son Jayden to have a heart attack. It was not given approval to be administered on pregnant females and was in testing phases for pre term labor.  This drug has cost me a lifetime of agony.,Regina Lane
4,Nifedipine,Premature Labor,7,,"May 4, 2014",6,I have been taking this for 1 weeks straight because of premature labor at 33 weeks pregnant. The medication didn't cause me a problem until about the 5th day I started getting horrible pressure and nauseating headaches. It has been working for the contractions though I still have them they are far more spaced apart and less regular. The things mothers will do for their babies that's all I have to say!,hclark2786
