0,Furosemide,Pulmonary Edema,10.0,,"July 26, 2021",2,I don't get the swelling of the calves and ankles with edema. Mine is pulmonary edema. For some reason my lungs fill up with fluid. Furosemide drains every bit of that out of me. It's a powerful fast acting diuretic and it gets the job done. I'm on 40mg once daily or as needed.,joccon
1,Furosemide,Pulmonary Edema,1.0,,"June 25, 2019",6,"I tried Furosemide 54/583 by Roxane Labs for treatment of CHF and edema. Response was zero. Pharmacy said pill was a generic lasix, which I doubt.",janet
2,Furosemide,Pulmonary Edema,,Taken for less than 1 month,"October 5, 2018",34,"Lasix (furosemide):I have been taking lasix for 2 days now. My swelling seems to come and go. I was swollen in my stomach, thighs, ankles and feet.  I couldn't walk and I was short of breathe. Thankfully with lasix I am able to walk and swelling going down. I take 40mg in the morning time",Sara
3,Furosemide,Pulmonary Edema,9.0,,"March 30, 2014",26,"Right after surgery, I had a fever, confusion, my blood pressure and rate of breathing went very low. I had not pee'd for several hours,  I had an oxygen level of 60 while I was sleepy and out of it. I was given 60mg of Lasix and not even 15 minutes later I was non stop peeing, my blood pressure and rate of breathing picked up quite a lot. I can't even imagine that the pee kept going on and on with the girls using bedpans for me. I was just out of surgery so that was necessary. Doctor keptthe oxygen level up to an 8 for the rest of the night. I believe that the medicine saved my life even though I threw up on it.",Linzybabe
