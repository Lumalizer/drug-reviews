0,Sandostatin,Carcinoid Tumor,8,Taken for 5 to 10 years,"April 16, 2017",13,"After about 18 months of 28 day LAR injections, I started having joint and back pain. I believe this is actually fairly common. I've asked who has this on various support group web sites.... lots of people!  One person had it start up after their first injection. However, more respondents had it start after a year or more. The main location of my pain is in the hips. I've been to several ortho doctors who say I do not have but a slight bit of arthritis in my hips- certainly not enough to warrant hip replacement & in the range of an average amount for my age..... the lower back pain started prior to hips. It has been deduced that the pain must be a side effect of the Sandostatin-  after x-rays, bone scans, MRI's, CT-etc.. nothing looks abnormal",Beepsie
1,Sandostatin,Carcinoid Tumor,10,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"January 4, 2013",38,"I agree with the other review.  This product has been a life saver for me.  It has completely taken away my other symptoms.  The only drawback for me is fatigue, but honestly I can live with it considering everything else that I am dealing with prior to taking this medication.",brauny
