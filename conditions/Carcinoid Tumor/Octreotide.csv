0,Octreotide,Carcinoid Tumor,9.0,Taken for 10 years or more,"September 9, 2021",1,"Sandostatin LAR Depot (octreotide):Been on Sandostatin LAR for 19 years now and has definitely  kept me going. Side effects were almost non-existent, a bit uncomfortable being administered due to the thickness of needle and consistency of mix, but over quickly. In the last 18 months, it's battling to hold back my markers (Chromogranin). Last 12 months up'd dose to every 3 weeks (from every 4 weeks), with little change. You'd think after 19 years, Novartis would drop the cost and also develop the next level.... sadly not!",BruceZA

2,Octreotide,Carcinoid Tumor,2.0,,"April 11, 2020",1,"octreotide  helps with watery stools. After second monthly injection, I am pretty miserable. I have, loose, pale, foul, chemical, smelling stools that float, bad pain at the injection site which makes it difficult to climb stairs, or walk, exhaustion, abdominal cramping, strange pain throughout body that comes and goes, some nausea that comes and goes, bad, lingering headache, Depression, and heavy anxiety. I hate it. I think I would rather just have the diarrhea.",Bee

I can't regain the lost weightor strength.  I'm very tired. The doctor can't tell me  if it helps the tumors secretion, or will I ever be right.",sickly
6,Octreotide,Carcinoid Tumor,8.0,Taken for 5 to 10 years,"April 16, 2017",13,"Sandostatin (octreotide):After about 18 months of 28 day LAR injections, I started having joint and back pain. I believe this is actually fairly common. I've asked who has this on various support group web sites.... lots of people!  One person had it start up after their first injection. However, more respondents had it start after a year or more. The main location of my pain is in the hips. I've been to several ortho doctors who say I do not have but a slight bit of arthritis in my hips- certainly not enough to warrant hip replacement & in the range of an average amount for my age..... the lower back pain started prior to hips. It has been deduced that the pain must be a side effect of the Sandostatin-  after x-rays, bone scans, MRI's, CT-etc.. nothing looks abnormal",Beepsie
7,Octreotide,Carcinoid Tumor,10.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"January 4, 2013",38,"Sandostatin (octreotide):I agree with the other review.  This product has been a life saver for me.  It has completely taken away my other symptoms.  The only drawback for me is fatigue, but honestly I can live with it considering everything else that I am dealing with prior to taking this medication.",brauny
8,Octreotide,Carcinoid Tumor,,,"December 17, 2009",10,"I was started on Octreotide for 2 weeks, did not have carcinoid syndrome before taking the short acting octreotide but as I continued to give myself the injections the diarrhea began and got worse.  No other complaints except of slight itching at injection site.  The oncologist was having me take them to keep tumors from growing and metastasizing.  She did, however, take me off of them because they were causing more problems than she thought it was worth for me.",lipsofscarlett
9,Octreotide,Carcinoid Tumor,10.0,,"August 10, 2009",37,"Sandostatin (octreotide):This medicine has been a life saver for me, nothing else worked. In a couple of days I felt improvement - no uncontrollable diarrhea. ",gthomp
