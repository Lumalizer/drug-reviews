1,Tamoxifen,Breast Cancer Metastatic,5,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"August 15, 2021",1,"I take tamoxifen for bone mets. I take 10mg tamoxifen at the same time as 10mg of melatonin and 125mg of Vit E succinate. I also juice veggies, eat vegan and take supplements. The side effects I have experienced are lighter periods and moods (my PMS is gone); mild, sporadic itching across my whole body; bone and achiness; tiredness. Iâ€™m hoping the tamoxifen will help to fill in the holes the cancer has left in my bones (I have heard reports of this happening).",Anonymous
