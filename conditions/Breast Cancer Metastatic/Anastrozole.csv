0,Anastrozole,Breast Cancer Metastatic,3,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"March 21, 2020",71,"Arimidex (anastrozole):I've been taking Arimidex for 4 years for breast cancer mets. I was diagnosed  with the mets to the bone in Jan/16. I'm to the point that I feel I just can't take this drug anymore, so I stopped today. I want to stop hurting so bad. I feel terrible in the morning when I try to get up.  I can no longer manage steps, standing for any length of time, walking is history. I'm on major amounts of narcotics but don't get nearly as much relief as I'd like. I just can't do it anymore. My life has no quality, this drug is not worth the amount of pain it causes!! So long Arimidex!",Kacie
1,Anastrozole,Breast Cancer Metastatic,2,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"February 1, 2020",21,I have been taking Anastrazole since March last year and am having terrible problems with my speech and swallowing.  Really terrifying incidents of choking.  I am also having problems with excessive phlegm in my throat which is worse at nights and takes time to clear. I do have Myasthenia Gravis which can cause some speech problems but I have never had the choking or the phlegm and mucus previously,Andarcsom
2,Anastrozole,Breast Cancer Metastatic,10,Taken for 5 to 10 years,"January 8, 2020",38,"My experience with Anastrozole has been beneficial. Following a double mastectomy and removal of the majority of my right arm lymph nodes, significant chemo and radiation, I started Anastrozole in 2013. None of the side effects have been too bad or debilitating, so I am very fortunate and grateful for this drug for the significant benefits. I will have to stop in a couple of years and that makes me nervous! As so many reviews here are about major issues, it's important to know that's not always the case.",Phyllis
3,Anastrozole,Breast Cancer Metastatic,9,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"April 7, 2018",40,Arimidex (anastrozole):I have been on Arimidex/Anastrozole with every 4 week Zometa infusion for 2 1/2 years with no side effects.  After reading other reviews I feel very lucky.  I am still doing weight training and boxing 2x a week.  Tumor markers are increasing slowly in the last 6 months but are barely still within normal range.,LJ
4,Anastrozole,Breast Cancer Metastatic,7,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"May 17, 2017",15,"Was diagnosed in Aug 2014 with stage 4. Had radiation and then Anastrzole Jan 2015. Nausea for 2 weeks, joint pains still, warm showers work with alleve for me night before and one during day.  Also I realized that a cane made quite a difference in hip/recovering neck surgery. I don't use it as much around house but on concrete (parking lots) areas is a must. I think the pressure was too much without it at first and delayed the healing as I am much stronger now. ***The weight gain is terrible/ 3 lbs a month and insomnia.*** Weeks watching food  (that's why a 7 rating) intake/limiting no difference at all and lots of water and walking. Still feel much stronger though and breast tumors have not increased. May 16 2017 also xgeva once a month injection",Lisa Grace
5,Anastrozole,Breast Cancer Metastatic,5,,"March 28, 2017",19,"I was dx lobular/mixed Stage3A BR Ca Hercept-, Estr and Progesterone+ in Nov 2012. Had lumpectomy for 5cm tumor and 9/16 + lymph nodes. Had chemo and radiation full boat. Anastrazole is difficult but life saving. I always see the cup as half full and for me this is now more important than ever! I was 66 when diagnosed and am now 70. I do have occasional hot flashes that go away quickly. My biggest complaint is sore hands and knees. My feet also tingle but I believe that is from the Taxol chemo. I find walking and getting up out of a chair difficult. BUT I recommend swimming. I go 3-4 times a week and wow what a difference! Water aerobics are great too. Try it and do what you can and you will feel a difference. Some days better than others!",Turette
