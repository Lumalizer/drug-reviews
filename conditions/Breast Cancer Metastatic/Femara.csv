0,Femara,Breast Cancer Metastatic,1,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"February 14, 2016",26,"I'll make this as brief as possible:This drug isn't putting a dent on ceasing tumor progression in me. Unfortunately, the intravenous chemo [Abraxane] I was on had plateaued and was no longer effective. I have no idea what I will be going on next.",Anonymous

2,Femara,Breast Cancer Metastatic,10,,"June 5, 2013",141,"Femara for 18 months no side effects for first 6 months, then joint and muscle pain, physical fatigue, bone density loss. Will continue for as long as it works, at the moment looking clear, I want to live.",ramade
3,Femara,Breast Cancer Metastatic,10,,"May 9, 2012",261,"I've been taking Femara since the breast cancer was discovered in my lung - that has been 10 years this year. Two types of chemo failed to knock it out and as I was preparing for radiation, I started taking Femara. Within a month the tumor began to shrink and all that is left is scarring where it once was. I am so grateful to my doctor for recommending it to me. My other oncologist didn't even mention it. Needless to say I'm happy to be alive and enjoying life.",Anonymous
4,Femara,Breast Cancer Metastatic,5,,"March 3, 2012",104,"After a year on Femara I am beginning to experience severe hair loss, bald patches on top of my head and the hair is turning thin and brittle. Insomnia for the last 2 months, pain in my joints, I was diagnosed with Glaucoma and am very forgetful, i.e. find it defficult to concentrate.  But, if Femara stops the recurrence of cancer, I'll keep taking it.  If it just were not for the hair loss. ",MVR
5,Femara,Breast Cancer Metastatic,1,,"November 30, 2010",98,"Had to get off of this. I still work and could not get past the ""brain fog"" and severe joint pain.",jkique
6,Femara,Breast Cancer Metastatic,10,,"May 23, 2010",137,"After 7 years of several different medicines to try to stop the growth of the tumors, Femara is the only one which worked for me. My WBC is higher, the tumor has actually shrunk in the breast - but being realistic, it's not a cure-all, a patch for a longer life but eventually we all expire. I highly recommend this product for those who want longevity without losing your quality of life.",Still Here
7,Femara,Breast Cancer Metastatic,9,,"July 14, 2009",178,"I have been using Femara for 8 months, and I have been having very few side effects. I get the hot flashes only once in a while now.  I do have some joint pain, but that has been easy to tolerate, if that means I will have a longer life, but only GOD knows that. There is always hope, just keep the faith and have no doubt in the medicine, doctors and mostly GOD.",Anonymous
