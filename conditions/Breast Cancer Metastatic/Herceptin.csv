0,Herceptin,Breast Cancer Metastatic,,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"November 21, 2017",17,These medicines saved my life and continue to keep me cancer free for over 3 years. Thank goodness for the scientists for these target therapy drugs (herceptin and perjeta)that focus on the bad cells with minimal side effects which allows for a pretty good quality of life in spite of cancer. If only the cost would be more affordable.,Anonymous

I took it every 3 weeks for 52 weeks.You will need a TET done on your heart before you start and Benadryl before infusion but I had no side effects. I did take it with Taxol for 12 weeks.
