0,Fulvestrant,Breast Cancer Metastatic,2.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"January 4, 2022",4,"Faslodex (fulvestrant):Nasty drug. I have post herpatic neuralgia,  this has increased the severity of the pain. I have diarrhoea,  and extreme lethargy. Only had 3 doses. Think the cure worse than the complaint. Seriously considering stopping treatment, and taking pot luck.",Jane
1,Fulvestrant,Breast Cancer Metastatic,2.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"December 16, 2021",1,"I am having a negative experience & discontinuing care. After 2nd injection, liver enzymes spiked. I'm badly jaundiced, nauseous, & itchy. I cannot properly digest food & it's difficult & painful to void my bowels, walk, & drive. At only 39, I still value quality of life over quantity, & this drug provides an unacceptable quality of life. I am working with an integrative clinic to flush it from my system because it's dreadfully long-lasting. My advice is not to use this, especially if you have a history of liver disorder or disease.",PoetMom
2,Fulvestrant,Breast Cancer Metastatic,1.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"October 9, 2021",6,"Faslodex (fulvestrant):I was relatively stable despite mets in bone, I was able to walk and function reasonably well.After the first fulvestrant I had digestive problems and tiredness. After the 2nd I had bone pain (new mets) and generalised muscle pain especially shoulders, trigeminal neuralgia possibly from brain mets and new breast lesions. I feel as if this medication has finished me off.Doctors do not take these bad outcomes seriously, the attitude is that it was going to happen anyway",Toula
3,Fulvestrant,Breast Cancer Metastatic,,Taken for 5 to 10 years,"September 4, 2021",2,"I am 79 years old and have battled breast cancer since 1999. During that time I had radiation, taken tamoxifen.  After 10 years, my cancer came back. I then had a mastectomy. Two years later my cancer metastasized to my spine. Thank God for Fulvestrant!  I have now been on Fuivestrant for 7 1/2 years. I have had constant sweats (I have a mini fan I always have with me) Constantly tired, no energy, constipation. At this time my blood work is fine and My cancer is dormant. The side effects are not fun at all, but I definitely can handle it with a smile on my face because I am alive! Thanks to all you have shared their experiences.",Anonymous

Yes, there are side effects; moody, bone pain, flu like syndrome for a few days...BUT all are managed well. I also take Verzenio. My liver functions are fine and my disease has not progressed at all.

6,Fulvestrant,Breast Cancer Metastatic,7.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"December 17, 2020",14,"Faslodex (fulvestrant):For 8 months I had injections in my butt every 28 days it did lower my estrogen . After stopping because of chronic injection pain they tried injection in the thigh. It’s been four months since last butt shots and 3 months since thigh shot. The pain is still there and very hard sometimes, I really believe nerve damage is cause, I’ve been back on letrozole for 2 months but still experience the chronic sporadic burning, numbing butt and thighs . Besides that it made me smell of burnt motor oil. Drs brush it off and say  oh I’ve never heard that before",Honee

8,Fulvestrant,Breast Cancer Metastatic,1.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"November 21, 2020",8,"Warning: Be very careful before agreeing to treatment with Fulvestrant. A study confirmed that, after breast cancer cells become resistant to Fulvestrant, an aggressive phenotype frequently develops thus causing significant migration and invasion. The study found that this occurs with breast cancer cell lines MCF7 and T47D.After about 12 months of treatment, skin lesions started forming on my breast. Over about 10 weeks to-date the lesions continue to migrate and now cover about 75% of my breast. Also, additional small lumps have appeared elsewhere below my armpit and in the center of my abdomen. Similar to another person’s post on this site, Fulvestrant was like miracle grow for my cancer. My cancer now is more aggressive than ever, since my initial diagnosis, prior to this treatment.Also, what is additionally disturbing is that the risk of this outcome is not indicated in any of the prescribing/patient information for the brand or the generic versions.",Anonymous

No side effects but now the treatment is Falsodex with Ibrance. Been experiencing dry mouth, slight pain in lower back, vision difference and loss of appetite. Not intolerable though. The injections don’t hurt because they warm it up. Hang in there ladies and carry on! Will update results.",Anonymous

12,Fulvestrant,Breast Cancer Metastatic,10.0,Taken for 5 to 10 years,"September 26, 2020",18,Faslodex (fulvestrant):I have been on Faslodex for 5 years now with no discernible side affects. My bloodwork and cat scans have all been good so I am happy with the drug. I can see from other comments that some people have had some terrible side affects so have gone off it. We all have different reactions and all we can do is keep searching until we find a drug that our bodies can handle. Thank god we have many more choices than we did 40 years ago and that we have free medical coverage here in Canada.,Laureen
13,Fulvestrant,Breast Cancer Metastatic,1.0,,"June 4, 2020",32,"Faslodex (fulvestrant):I want to warn you all about this drug. A very close person to me died because of Faslodex.  She was put on it after the previous drug stopped working and even though she had changes on her liver the doctor decided to put her on Faslodex. Her physical state was very good at that point. Already after the first injection she started experiencing severe pain in her lower back.  Then from one injection to another, her state was getting worse. Her liver got inflamed and she couldn't eat normally. It got to the point where she couldn't walk anymore, from severe pains and weakness. She died in pain, not knowing what was happening to her, and doctors couldn't explain anything, despite numerous exams. Final diagnosis was general metastasis - while only two weeks before her death she had all the exams that showed nothing. Therefore - please think twice before you trust your doctor. If your reaction to Faslodex is as bad, stop it immediately and stay away from it because it's POISON.",Jane
14,Fulvestrant,Breast Cancer Metastatic,9.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"March 3, 2020",28,Faslodex (fulvestrant):I am 76 and was diagnosed with stage 4 metastatic breast cancer in bones 21 months ago. Have been on Arimidex till it now shows spots in liver and surrounding lymph nodes.  Have had 3 shots of Faslodex.  Two had no ill effects but one has left huge lumps because the medication was not heated and the shot was placed higher and released faster than the other two.  Make sure the nurse heats it!!!Tomorrow I am supposed to start Ibrance but wonder if the 7 months it supposedly adds to my life is worth the side effects.Many thanks to all of you who have taken the time to post.  It has been helpful.  It made me realize that the pain in my jaw is probably from the  bone strengthening infusion I get.And lastly I was surprised and encouraged that some of you have lived so long with cancer.,Candy girl

I have been on the injection for 7 years and it has kept the cells from growing. Minimal side effects. The biggest problem is the cost. Even with Insurance it's over $800 a month. I may need to stop the injections.",Seda
16,Fulvestrant,Breast Cancer Metastatic,3.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"October 16, 2019",20,"Faslodex (fulvestrant):I was diagnosed with stage 4 breast cancer, mets to bone, this past April.  I have been on Faslodex,(5 months) Xgeva (4 months) & Ibrance (2+ months).   My Dr. has weaned me off everything because of side effects of EXTREME fatigue, weakness, nausea, shortness of breath, bone pain, dizziness, low  while blood cells (wbc) which is from the Ibrance).  I can tell the Xgeva was responsible for the majority on my weakness, but the Faslodex still has be so weak that I want to buy a walker.  I can also tell you that my nurse warmed my shot for 20 to 30 minutes & gave me my injections high on my butt, with no weight on the corresponding leg & that  I had no pain whatsoever.  Also used Biotin mouthwash per  dentist.  I have two weeks until Faslodex is entirely out of my system.  It did work in healing my lesions per my CT scans its just the side effects were too debilitating.",Sunny
17,Fulvestrant,Breast Cancer Metastatic,10.0,,"August 23, 2019",27,"Faslodex (fulvestrant):I was diagnosed with Metastatic Breast Cancer to the bones  6 years and 4 mos ago.  Initially I was treated with Letrozole and Xgeva worked for me for about 4 yrs 8 mos but then the found some active spots on my spine again.  I had more Radiation and Have been on Faslodex, Ibrance and Xgeva ever since.  I don’t get bad reactions from Faslodex.  If the nurse warms up the Faslodex before it is injected it is easier for the nurses to injectand it feels better.  The area of the injection is a bit tender for a couple days but nothing bad.  My urine smells like ammonia or something for a couple days.I really don’t get side effects from Faslodex.  I have terrible dry mouth but I take many meds.  Lately I have been horribly tired but I see the Dr tomorrow.To anyone that has jaw pain that is probably from your Xgeva and can be very painful and definitely something the Dr needs to know.  Please call your Dr.I hope you are all doing well!",Mini9045
18,Fulvestrant,Breast Cancer Metastatic,9.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"March 15, 2019",33,"Faslodex (fulvestrant):My wife has been on this med for 5 years now. She started it right after her cancer returned and had spread to her spine and hip. She has all the same side effects you guys talk about and where it was the first week following her injection was bad the longer she has been on it this time is starting to extend. How effective is faslodex  - well it has stopped all growth, it has not reversed it however it has kept it stable all this time. For the lady who asked about the dental issues my wife has had the same issue and is loosing teeth. It is known as mandibular necrosis and it is usually cause by the shot they give to strengthen her bones . Has anyone else been on the med for longer than 5 years?",Gene
19,Fulvestrant,Breast Cancer Metastatic,,,"September 4, 2018",24,Faslodex (fulvestrant):I've been on the shots for 5 months ...the first 3 months I received the shots from another Dr. and they were painful in administration AND for 2-3 days after.  I changed Dr.'s and the nurse that has given it to me the last two months has made a big difference I have very little pain with the injection and no pain in my buttocks afterwards..what a blessing. My take on that is it wasn't warmed up to room temp and she is injecting it higher on the butt than the other nurse did. I get a funny taste immediately and my urine has a chemical smell for about a week...that's about it...,roadrunner

I have a lot of side effects — same as everyone else.  I was just wondering if anyone is experiencing jaw pain. It just came on suddenly.  I went to dentist and they said I have bone loss but no infection to cause pain.  Some days the jaw hurts more than others.,Kathy

Was on it for 3 months and it was like miracle grow for my MBC, my liver mets flourished into a garden of tumors. Aromasin for 9 months started the two small liver lesions to multiply like crazy and the Faslodex was worse. All sizes of tumors, the largest being 12 cm. I was on the cusp of liver failure. Also caused sciatica in my left side and have had that for a yr and will never go away.New oncologist put me on Taxol for 7 months. The first 5 months liver enzymes were dropping, tumors shrinking and the last 2 months Taxol stopped working. Eveything reversed. Tried CMF and Xeloda, side effects were severe I refused to do any more treatments. Abraxane now, bad side effects.",Abigailmaltese

The side effects I experience are; sweating, hot flashes again, severe bone pain, nausea, fatigue big time, constipation, etc.  It is worth it to me because it is all tolerable and the other alternative is my cancer would start growing again.
