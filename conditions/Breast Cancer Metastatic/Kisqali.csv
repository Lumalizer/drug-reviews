Expected the worst but no negative side effects whatsoever. So far bi monthly blood work and ECG’s give me the green light. WBC count within range. I take 600 mg Kisqali along with 2.5 mg Letrozole. Then hit the mountain and hike for an hour. Feel great. Still work part time. I’m 65. I hope this continues.,Quickbread

10,Kisqali,Breast Cancer Metastatic,8,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"February 7, 2018",53,"I made it 5 rounds before my liver enzymes just wouldn't go down. It shrunk everything by at least half! My RBC and neutrophils are right on the line. Not sure what's next for me --I was on the Kisqali/Femara combo with monthly injections of Xgeva and Zoladex. I struggled with constipation and dried out everything -- but that might be from being forced into menopause. If you happen to be on this combo: Some hair thinning, unexplained blurry and double vision, rage!, dementia, balance problems, sleep problems, and thyroid issues -- but from what I've heard, a million times easier than old school chemo.
