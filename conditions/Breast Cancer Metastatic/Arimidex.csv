0,Arimidex,Breast Cancer Metastatic,3,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"March 21, 2020",71,"I've been taking Arimidex for 4 years for breast cancer mets. I was diagnosed  with the mets to the bone in Jan/16. I'm to the point that I feel I just can't take this drug anymore, so I stopped today. I want to stop hurting so bad. I feel terrible in the morning when I try to get up.  I can no longer manage steps, standing for any length of time, walking is history. I'm on major amounts of narcotics but don't get nearly as much relief as I'd like. I just can't do it anymore. My life has no quality, this drug is not worth the amount of pain it causes!! So long Arimidex!",Kacie
1,Arimidex,Breast Cancer Metastatic,9,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"April 7, 2018",40,I have been on Arimidex/Anastrozole with every 4 week Zometa infusion for 2 1/2 years with no side effects.  After reading other reviews I feel very lucky.  I am still doing weight training and boxing 2x a week.  Tumor markers are increasing slowly in the last 6 months but are barely still within normal range.,LJ
