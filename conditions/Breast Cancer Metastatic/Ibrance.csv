After being on Ibrance for 4 months my tumor in my breast was gone as well as in my two affected lymph nodes. I still have bone mets in my lower back and a few spots on my liver but, I am doing well! No pain and my tumor markers have been constantly going down. I feel great! I am also on xgeva and flasodex shots monthly to treat the bone mets. I am so very thankful that my treatment has been working. Thank you for this wonderful medication. Blessings to all of you.",Truly Blessed
1,Ibrance,Breast Cancer Metastatic,3.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"November 24, 2021",2,"1st I'd like to say that seeing so many positive reviews makes me very happy.  I do not wish to take away from the success, quality of life & even remission of those for which it has worked. I'd just like to report my Mom's story.  My Mom had breast cancer in 2001.  She has been remission since 2002 & I could not be more grateful. During a trip to the ER for severe stomach pain late 2018, a very terse ER tech rudely asked my Mom why she didn't tell him & how long had she had cancer in her bones. Sadly, the breast cancer had returned.  She was stable on injections until a spot appeared on her liver late last year.That's when she was put on Ibrance. It seemed to be doing it's job but Mom was getting so weak...  She completed the cycle but it did too much damage to her numbers & we almost lost her.And, it mitral valve prolapse/regur that led to congestive heart failure.  I know that everyone reacts differently.  I just needed to share. Thank you for reading.  God Bless",Lost
2,Ibrance,Breast Cancer Metastatic,8.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"November 1, 2021",2,"I was originally diagnosed in 2018. Was told that 4 rounds of chemo and have bilateral mastectomy. My cancer was in my left nipple and it like deteriorating and separating from my breast very itchy. I had surgery along with cosmetic surgery. Fast forward 2021 and I had a severe cough, turns out double pneumonia with fluid development in my lungs. Had to have my lungs drained with eventually having a lung catheter implanted.  From the fluid they found some cancerous cells there.  Some spots in my lungs, liver with this crazy cough.  Started to see an oncologist and was diagnosed with MBC. I asked if there was a pill because I was not ready mentally to do chemo. She told me about ibrance and fasolodex. I started in June and so far I am doing well. I was went on 125mg reduced to 100mg. Side effects low blood count. I get really short of breath to the point where it’s hard to walk.",Bjc

In April 2020 my tumor marker shot up so Bone and CT scan were done, results not good so a biopsy was done on lower spine and May 5, 2020 found out that the cancer had metastasized to my bones.  June 2020 started Faslodex Injections, July 2020 started Ibrance capsules and Xgeva injections.  PET scan in September and December 2020 showed no progression or activity and CT in April 2021 shows no progression or activity.  I am thankful that this treatment regimen is working.

I am now on my 9th or 10th round of Ibrance. Doing great. CA 15-3 has reduced from 200 to 29. CT's show all tumours have reduced in size and number (liver, oesophagus, vertebrae, pelvis, intra-pleural space). No significant side effects. Neutrophils dip at end of each round but recover well.

Throat pain I did not have with the caramel capsules. What's the use to change a drug's capsule? It had to be taken with a meal. Now the tablet has a dirtier feel and it was harder to tolerate as well. Cancer markers have gone up in the end. Side effects are bad...eyes, immunity drop needed for the battle.

6,Ibrance,Breast Cancer Metastatic,6.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"January 28, 2021",13,"I was started on Ibrance in March 2020. I had a lot of weakness and abnormal labs when I first started taking it. I was also getting radiation which contributed. After a couple of months I was better and able to return to work. Since that time I have had a few minor side effects.  A sore mouth and some rash from time to time but nothing I couldn’t handle. From March to Oct my cancer antigens dropped from 258-66. In Nov I had COVID and it has all been down hill. Not sure if that plays any part or not. Since Dec I have required to be in the hosp for pain, have gone through a 2nd course of radiation and my cancer antigen has gone back up and now back to 201. Right now my bone pain is so bad I can barely walk to the bathroom. When I try to even  sit up the pain is bad.

7,Ibrance,Breast Cancer Metastatic,1.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"January 10, 2021",9,"Ibrance sadly was not be effective for long. For the first 3 months it kept my breast cancer stable. RGCC to get rid of the cancer cells  in Vitro test tube response showed 25% elimination rate. Not really that impressive. Within 3 months the elimination rate had dropped to ZERO and the cancer was progressing again. We went off it about 6 months too late instead of monitoring every month for resistance. Even Ibrances new reports say average efficacy time before resistance is 7.8 months but I have found much shorter. For all the problems this drug causes and bad side effects IMO its not a good option, better off with SOT and IPT treatments.",truth
8,Ibrance,Breast Cancer Metastatic,10.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"December 14, 2020",11,"Taking Ibrance has been very positive. I am on my 4th round with no side effects. First diagnosed with Stage 3 in 2004 then d Stage 4 in 2016. For 4 years I have been unable to swallow due to oesophageal thickening after cancer cells migrated into the outer muscular layer from the surrounding lymph nodes. All my nutrition other than water density fluids has been taken through a PEG tube directly into my stomach. After 6 weeks on Ibrance  I was able to transition to eating all my meals. It is a real joy to be able to eat again. A recent CT scan showed marked reduction of tumors in my liver, lymph nodes, oesophagus and vertebrae with new bone growth evident. Cancer markers (CA15-3) have reduced from 200 to 70. I am also on Letrizole. So far I am very happy with the results. I am also thankful that our government (New Zealand) put this medication of the ""free list"" earlier this year and it now does not cost anything (previously it would have cost $4500 per cycle).",Maisie

10,Ibrance,Breast Cancer Metastatic,3.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"November 30, 2020",7,I have been on Ibrance since June 2017.  I loved the capsules. They were easy to take on the go and not many side effects.  July 2020 I was switched to the pills after being in the capsules over three years.  I really reall don't like these pills.  The packaging is awful and the side effects terrible.  I have a lot of stomach issues on the pill form that I did not have on the capsules.  My liver enzymes have gone up.  It use to be a great medicine and they changed it to the point I’m considering asking my dr to change to another inhibitor drug. I use to always be quick to recommend Ibrance to a new patient when I had capsules. Now I won’t recommend it at all.,Florida Girl
11,Ibrance,Breast Cancer Metastatic,10.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"September 3, 2020",30,"I have been taking ibrance/letrozole since 2017 for breast cancer mets, with great results.  No new growth! Recently the ibrance capsules were changed to a tablet.  The new tablet comes in 3 cards of blister packs per month.  The tablet is easy to swallow, as was the capsule.  However, the blister packs that it comes in are very difficult to open, especially for those of us with arthritis or who are weak.  I was told not to open the packs early to load my pill case due to the stability of the tablet.  We have enough problems without having to struggle to get a pill out of a pack every day.  Perhaps the company could change back to the capsules in a bottle or reinvent the tablet so it can be in a bottle.  Thank you",nancy

I only have one area under my armpit showing signs of cancer not four. And the  one that is in my throat is only half the size it was before. The medication is working!!!!! Praise god.

25,Ibrance,Breast Cancer Metastatic,1.0,,"March 9, 2019",47,"I went on it for one cycle with letrozole.   Immediately I felt so awful like I had been poisoned.  All my lab work became really horrible.  I was so weak and sick I could barely move.  I had to skip many doses because I was so sick.  And then found out the cancer progressed crazy fast in the less than three weeks on it.  It took me many months to recover.  I feel like I have PTSD from  being on that drug.  And with the side effects being so horrendous I stopped the letrozole during the first week because the hormonal side effects on top of the toxic poisoned feelings on Ibrance weren't helping things at all.   So far I've done about a dozen metastatic breast cancer treatments since diagnosis in 2011, and that was the scariest and most dangerous treatment ever.

Then, a small suspicious lesion appeared on said breast that, when biopsied, was diagnosed as positive non hormone receptive & my Doc recommended removal.  Shortly after surgery, my Doc retired.  Results were not good afterwards but, after finding a new Doc quite some time later, he prescribed Exemestane &, later, Ibrance.

After two months I complained about breathlessness but my oncologist assumed that we should give it some more time to work because of the promotional reviews and propaganda by Pfizer.

I received chemo(Cytoxan, Adria, Taxotere) no radiation.  Was clear for 13 years until Oct 2015 diagnosed with mets to bone. Had right hip replacement for fracture and radiation. Other lesions noted in spine, left hip, and mammary node.  Started Ibrance and Letrozole with very little side effects. Some hair thinning, occasional mouth sore, fatigue at times.  Side effects very minimal. Also received Xgevia injection monthly.  Results excellent: markers good, lesions inactive for 17 months. Recently had Pet scan and found active lesion on left hip. Next plan is to do some radiation, Fasoldex injections monthly and continue Xgevia",15 years and still swinging

Actually am worse off now than before. It seems to have triggered something to make my mets spread.Side effects: mild to moderate. Bad fatigue and mouth soresInsurance out of pocket would have been $60 a month, but co pay assistance made it only $10.",Jaja67

I take both with my main meal at night.I have not had a scan yet. She's planning one in early March. My oncologist said wine with dinner is ok.I've heard many say alcohol is terrible to drink with cancer. I'm confused what I should be doing with alcohol. A little or none at all?I'm trying to learn about health products and the benefit of mushrooms. It's still overwhelming but I'm hopeful. I'm very tired on Ibrance.

My onocologist put me on Ibrance , hormonal therapy and a bone shot. I am in my second month of taking it so I cannot tell you if any of the cancer has gotten smaller or even gone away. My blood work, all came back well , after the first mo. Being so aggressive! I will see him in the third month to see if the tumor has been affected by the treatment. He is so optimistic about this drug  :-) I can help some new ibrance patients out by telling you to eat smaller amounts of food. I think I have drank more water on ibrance ,than I have in the last year combined.  I myself would not recommend taking it at night ! Lot's of water !!",Faithbewithus
50,Ibrance,Breast Cancer Metastatic,9.0,,"November 23, 2016",103,"I was prompted to write this after reading some of the negative reviews. God how I wish this would work for everyone. I have only been on it for around 7 months but my first scan was promising (I have bone metastasis and there were no new spots and previous lesions appeared smaller). I go for my next scan in a few weeks. I'm so fortunate in that I've had no side effects. Your neutrophils will dip and yes, I'm tired at times but what else is new. I know that some are experiencing terrible side effects but I wanted to chime in and say that not everyone experiences them. I do take spirulina pills and they seem to help get my neutrophils where they should be (above 1.0). If you are a candidate for ibrance, count yourself lucky and try it!","Scans promising, no side effec"
51,Ibrance,Breast Cancer Metastatic,10.0,,"November 7, 2016",94,"I'm on Faslodex and Ibrance. My cancer was in my lymph nodes near my clavicle, on T10, T11, T12, L5, on my Sacrum and spread around my pelvis in a lot of little spots, plus it was in my hip joint. My organs were spared, but it was scary since it was in my lymph nodes. I've been on Faslodex since August 2016 and I started Ibrance in September 2016. In just two months, all of my lesions have shrunk and there's no new metabolic activity surrounding what remains. I take my Ibrance at night and don't feel dizzy or nauseous. I don't feel too great if I eat too much, but as long as I eat light meals, my energy is good and I feel normal. I do feel fatigued from time to time, but a quick nap leaves me feeling refreshed.",Harry's Mom

Earlier this year Doctors discovered that I had metastatic cancer. A nine inch cancer between the lung and rib cage. Side effects of Ibrance were a little rough at first but eased up as time went by. Stomach problems, headaches, weakness but they eased up as time went by. I learned that I had to drink lots of water. It is now 8 months later and My cancer is in remission.",Halt

Was prescribed oxygen on exertion.  First few weeks on Ibrance, I was getting worst but by 2nd week of December, cancer damage started reversing.  tumor disappeared, lung fluid decreased, SPO2 got normal.  In April 2016, PetScan says that cancer is no longer detectable... latest PetScan in July says the same plus no more pleural effusion.  I didn't have any side effects at all.

58,Ibrance,Breast Cancer Metastatic,1.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"December 14, 2015",55,"My oncologist was enthusiastic to put me on Ibrance due to the reports and fast tracking of approval for the drug.   I was on Ibrance for 6 months and it was a disaster.   The drug did nothing for the cancer.  In fact, the cancer spread a little with use of Ibrance.   The side effects were great.   Normal hematocrit levels should have been 35-45, but with Ibrance, mine were 20-25.  It wiped out my immune system, made me anemic, and provided a whole host of negative side effects.   I know of a few people who were also on Ibrance and it did not work for them.   One of them ended up in the hospital for weeks.  I have had a hard time connecting or finding patients who have had a positive experience.   Ibrance is not as advertised.",JanVA

My doctor is extremely supportive of it's uses and anticipated outcomes. (I have a fantastic doctor) I've had ease of access, when I mention Ibrance to medical professionals and the like their response is positive according to what they're hearing. My side effects have been few and not severe. The only major reaction I experienced was during the course of undergoing radiation treatments and taking Ibrance & Femara in combination. I became neutropenic (sp?) w/mild diarrhea, weakness, dehydration and throat and esophagus challenges. My challenges were a bit overwhelming.  The newness of Ibrance concerns me. Just hoping it does the job!  Thank you.",Only Positive
