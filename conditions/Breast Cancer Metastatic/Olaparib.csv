0,Olaparib,Breast Cancer Metastatic,10,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"August 7, 2021",4,"Lynparza (olaparib):I had TNBC with BRCA1 mutation and had complete pathologic response after chemo and mastectomy. Four years later I was diagnosed with a recurrence in my supraclavucal lymph node and multiple nodules in lungs. I was on Lynparza alone  for 10 months until it recently stopped working. I had very few side effects that subsided within a few weeks and from that moment on I didn't feel I had cancer or had any side effects. I was able to do everything and lead a very active life style. Unfortunately, Olaparib no longer works and I'm starting something else. I wish I could be on Lynparza forever. Best quality of life ever.",Lel
