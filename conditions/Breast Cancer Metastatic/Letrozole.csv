2,Letrozole,Breast Cancer Metastatic,10.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"October 4, 2021",2,"I've been on letrozole for 4 years, since I was first diagnosed with stage 4 metastatic breast cancer. The first year I also took Kisqali. 2 years ago was able to take just letrozole alone and has kept me stable with no progression. I have gained 20lbs over the past two years, impossible to lose. I also have a lot of aches and pains in bone and muscle. Also have insomnia, sweating and genitourinary syndrome. I've also become prediabetic. Unfortunately, I can't go off of this medication as stage 4 is terminal. I am fortunate to only need a hormone blocker for now but the SEs are still intolerable at times.",Island Girl

10,Letrozole,Breast Cancer Metastatic,9.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"March 26, 2018",44,"At 75  I was paralyzed from the waist down and diagnosed with stage 4 ovarian cancer & paraneoplastic  syndrome. My main tumor was size of an American football, with Mets. Given 1 dose of chemo.  2 weeks later I got pneumonia, a UTI and severe sepsis. My kids were told I had 2 hours to live. Still there the next day I was given a 1% chance of living for a month.  More chemo was out so was put on Letrozole. After 8 months of paralysis, I moved my right foot.  I started physio,  and within 3 months I learned to stand then walk.  A year on, my tumors continue to shrink.  Then joint pain started after about 8 months in  hips, wrists, knees, ankles & bones on top of my feet and I seized up every time I take a break and have start all over again. Morning is  hardest. But the bottom line is I am alive. I have been declared a medical miracle... and I owe it all to Letrozole. The pain can be quite bad at times but I take no pain killers. I just sit down and consider the alternative! Thank you Letrozole",HH

Letrazole was the first aromatase inhibitor I tried.I am so sorry to hear of the side effects many have had. I have had a few. Gained a little weight,constipation. But I had serious joint pain and stiffness before I had cancer. The chemo made my joint pain and stiffness go away. Even my hips.When I finished it crept back. Then I started letrazole and it went away. I know this helps me becuase I ran out of it on vacation for two days and could barely move the day I got my refill. After three doses I was back to normal. That is good because I have to take it as long as I live.",Danielinthelionsden
17,Letrozole,Breast Cancer Metastatic,10.0,Taken for 5 to 10 years,"June 21, 2015",46,"After a modified radical mastectomy for stage 3 breast cancer, I took letrozole for 5 years and my tumor marker test (CA 15-3) remained low. My oncologist and I decided that without any indication of malignancy I could safely go off the letrozole. After 2 years off it my (CA 15-3) blood test shot up and I was diagnosed with metastatic breast cancer on my chest wall. I resumed taking letrozole and had 36 radiation treatments. I have taken letrozole for 7 months now and my most current CT scan showed the lesion was gone. I know the radiation destroyed most of the lesion but I'm sure the letrozole helped a lot with the rest. I probably will take letrozole for the rest of my life.",Bananafaced
