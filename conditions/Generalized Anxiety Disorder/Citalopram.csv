0,Citalopram,Generalized Anxiety Disorder,,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"January 31, 2022",5,I had a traumatic childhood being the child of several divorces on both sides and lots of physical and emotional abuse. I had managed my symptoms with meds and CBT through 20’s and was off in my 30’s. I had some trauma happen through the pandemic and lost a dear friend as well as my own health scares that paired with heightened anxiety over COVID I began having terrible OCD/GAD that turned into depression. I couldn’t fathom life and figured I’d be better off not in it. I started 10mg generic celexa and moved up to 20mg after 8 days. I had no side effects besides a fuzzy feeling in my head on the first few days. This stuff changed my life. My symptoms are under control I can stop the obsessive thoughts and ruminating and I can walk away from doing one of my OCD rituals. I’m no longer consumed most of the day by ruminating and obsessing. I don’t feel like life is pointless. Don’t let bad reviews deter you from trying this medication like I did.,PBYogi
1,Citalopram,Generalized Anxiety Disorder,9.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"January 4, 2022",0,"I have been taking Citalopram 20mg for 4 weeks today. I am female and I do get spikes in anxiety, panic, intrusive thoughts, etc especially the 2 weeks before menstrual cycle starts. I should preface this with, I took lexapro 10mg for almost 10 years, had a baby, and lexapro wasn’t as effective, zoloft for 6mo, Effexor XR for over a year, still wasn’t cutting it, cymbalta for a mo, (stopped Cym. after genesight test) and now taking citalopram. It has been a bit of a rough road switching from SNRI back to SSRI, but the last 3 days have given me hope, I’ve weaned down from taking 1.5-1.75mg of klonopin/day to only .5-.75mg and hopes of not needing it at all once citalopram is in full swing. You have to give medication time. 100%. If you haven’t looked into Genesight Testing, I highly recommend that as well!",Moving Forward

3,Citalopram,Generalized Anxiety Disorder,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"December 24, 2021",3,"I've been suffering with extreme work related stress and anxiety which also turned into depression. I couldn't face work, social situations or even going to the shops. I ended up weeping all the time, with no energy, not getting out of bed, constantly worrying and unable to stop ruminating obsessively. My doctor started me on 10mg of citalopram. The first one and a half to two weeks were awful, I had to stay off work and not do anything for that time. I started off having racing thoughts, increased anxiety, jaw clenching, nausea, the jitters and being unable to sleep for the first week despite feeling tired all the time, although my mood did improve and I wasn't tearful as much. This tapered to just increased anxiety, some nausea and tiredness. I'm now nearly into my third week and I'm feeling so much better. I have more energy, my mood is good, I don't panic about work, I don't get intrusive, repeating negative thoughts and worries and my self esteem is back to normal.",Actna

6,Citalopram,Generalized Anxiety Disorder,9.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"December 4, 2021",0,"Citalopram 10mg was my first attempt as an antidepressant. I had GAD with some depressive symptoms but not enough to qualify as depression. After 4 weeks of heightened anxiety (which are a sign that the medicine is working)  the anxiety reduced quite a lot and the mood improved. However, citalopram made me really sleepy, to the point I was always falling asleep around 7pm. I switched to Lexapro later which worked wonders and did not make me so sleepy. After 3 months on Lexapro I switched to Brintellix, another drug, that is lighter and did not give me orgasm problems.",supermouse

8,Citalopram,Generalized Anxiety Disorder,10.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"September 25, 2021",2,"(Review from UK, 21y/o) I decided to try medication at the start of August as I was struggling with really bad anxiety, having constant panic attacks and mild agoraphobia. I couldn’t go far from home and felt like I was constantly in fight or flight mode no matter where I was. I was started on sertraline but had bad side effects in just 2 days and developed an allergic reaction so couldn’t carry on with it. Then I was put on Citalopram, 10mg for a week and then upped to 20mg. It has been 6-7 weeks now and I can’t believe how this has changed my life. I am getting back to who I was but also feeling like a new person. I haven’t had a panic attack in weeks and I am happy to go out and do things that were unthinkable for me 2 months ago. I’m not cured by any means but I am feeling so much better in such a short period of time it’s amazing. Side effects were minimal, mainly tiredness and that’s really it.",reviewer2000
9,Citalopram,Generalized Anxiety Disorder,10.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"September 2, 2021",2,"At the beginning of August I had a really bad panic attack to the point where I called the ambulance on myself. Everyday after this panic attack I started dealing with non stop anxiety attacks and terrible insomnia. I couldn’t sleep more than 45 min without waking up and having an anxiety attack. I thought my life was over. All I thought about was my anxiety, and the next time I would have a panic attack was. I was fully consumed by my anxious thoughts. I went to the hospital 3 more times in the span of 2 weeks because I couldn’t deal with my own thoughts anymore. My doctor prescribed me citalopram at the beginning of August, after about 3 weeks it kicked in and my life has been amazing ever since. No more panic attacks, no more anxiety and no more insomnia. I can sleep through the night, and if I do wake up, I’m able to just go back to sleep. No more thoughts consuming me and no more worrying. Citalopram changed my life.",Emily
10,Citalopram,Generalized Anxiety Disorder,3.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"May 24, 2021",15,"After suffering from generalized anxiety disorder, I took celexa. I had horrible side effects: didn’t want to leave bed, nausea, diarrhea, stomach pains, feeling like I’m losing control, anxiety attacks daily,  dizziness, no energy, no appetite (lost 15 lbs). The most concerning side effect was that this medication made me depressed. Mind you, I’ve never had depression in my whole life and the purpose of me taking this drug was to combat my anxiety. I’ve been taking it for 2 months and my psychiatrist said it’s reached it’s full potential. I gave this a 3/10 because at the 7 week mark I had a couple average days. Average days really aren’t enough though to live a meaningful and happy life.A lot of doctors say that at the two month mark you’ll feel better, and that’s not always true. Things got worse for me on these meds. Wishing everyone who reads this all the love in the world and just know that things WILL get better, whether celexa or another pill helps!",Nikkisixx
11,Citalopram,Generalized Anxiety Disorder,8.0,,"May 5, 2021",11,"I have generalized anxiety. After 1.5 y of unsuccessful therapy, I was recommended to take citalopram. I tapered up slowly and at 15mg the side effects began (night sweat, increase in anxiety) but the worst one was severe insomnia that lasted for 3 weeks. I also had a bit of mood swings. However, at 4th week benchmark, the anxiety disappeared completely, the insomnia disappeared (I take it in the evening and I manage to sleep). I was slightly depressed for 7-10 days after, but my mood gradually improved. I’m now at 2 months in at 20mg and feel normal. I’m less interested in sex than when I was healthier (compared to 5 years ago), but I now enjoy sex better than when I was anxious. I’m extremely happy with the results. The only persisting side effect is a sight daytime drowsiness. If this continues at the third month, my dr will consider switching to escitalopram, a sister drug that is more antidepressant but less anxiolytic than citalopram, so it is supposed to be less sedative.",MG
12,Citalopram,Generalized Anxiety Disorder,5.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"April 28, 2021",14,"I have been taking citalopram 30mg for 3 years now.  I had a rough adjustment to it (started at 5mg) but I am sensitive to any drugs.  It was my last resort so I stuck with it.  One thing I learned is that if you are undermethylated these drugs will most likely work for you because you typically have low serotonin.  However if you are an overmethylator you will be too high in serotonin and these drugs can make you manic and worse.  So, I would suggest getting a methylation test to see if SSRi’s are suitable.  Also, very important is the kryptopyrrole test.  It tests you for an inherited condition called Pyroluria.  If you have it you can treat your depression and anxiety with high doses of vitamin b6 and zinc.  Please research these things before you start on these meds because for some like myself they are very hard to ween off of.",Lily

I was diagnosed with GAD, and for the first week my anxiety was high all the time. No sleep, no resting, no eating. My body was high alert. Headaches and loss of appetite too. But, after those 7 days, I felt better, little by little. I noticed I slept, had a meal, laughed, hugged, invested my time, etc. Yes, side effects are unpleasant, but so is living with anxiety for years. This stuff helps you come out.",Meggix
14,Citalopram,Generalized Anxiety Disorder,9.0,,"April 15, 2021",6,I tried Sertraline but it had very negative effects. Then I tried citalopram at 20mg per day for 7 weeks and made me feel much worse. Titrated down to 10mg for a couple of months and have found that though it may not be the silver bullet for GAD it certainly does take the edge from it. Overthinking and having too much time on my hands are also factors which make my GAD worse. Citalopram helps me a lot while I slowly adjust my thinking processes and challenge negative core values about myself which took many years to build up.,Dave Boy
15,Citalopram,Generalized Anxiety Disorder,1.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"April 6, 2021",6,I tried 20 mg per day for anxiety and it made no difference whatsoever after 3 months even after upping the dose.

16,Citalopram,Generalized Anxiety Disorder,9.0,,"April 4, 2021",53,"Honestly, I remember coming on here and reading the reviews before trying it myself. This medication changed so much for me, in a great way. I struggle with GAD and I had major panic attacks that led me to be hospitalized. I was not a fan of wanting to take medication for my mental health challenges, but at that point, I had no other choice but to try. It was hard at first, side effects were a little bit annoying, but eventually, I started to feel human again. I hadn’t had a panic attack anymore since then, or at least as severe/strong, and I didn't feel like my anxiety was constantly weighing on me every second. I tried to lower my dosage once I was feeling better, but it turned out it was too early for me to reduce my dose. I am currently taking 20mg everyday and have been on it for about 6 months. I encourage you to try it, and if you’re worried about it, know that trying it is better than not knowing at all. Goodluck!",Anon
17,Citalopram,Generalized Anxiety Disorder,5.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"April 3, 2021",8,Was on citalopram 10mg for 2 weeks. Side effects was that I couldn't sleep.  High anxiety a few times and nausea a few times . 3rd week and now starting 20mg. Nausea this morning.  Just hope side effects are not too strong and don't last a long time. Want to feel normal again. Been a roller coaster trying to find right medication.  Have high hopes for this one as depression  and anxiety is slightly lower. I'm sure another couple weeks and I will feel great and I be able to sleep,Ron

21,Citalopram,Generalized Anxiety Disorder,7.0,,"December 17, 2020",15,"Citalopram is a rough start up and though informed of side fx,  wasn’t ready. I am on 20’s and take them around 10:30pm. Days 1 & 2 I was unable to do more than lay around sweating, feeling heart palpitations and the most tired I’ve ever been. Shaky from pressure changes, a little dizzy and some gas. Slept around 12 hours. Very little to no hunger and a very dry mouth. Soup, ramen, popsicles and ice cream. Days 3 & 4Was the first time I felt a lift of side effects though only shortly. Still a little dizzy, gassy and the hands and feet were really tingling. Yawning almost constantly. Slept 14 sweaty hours each day. Very little to no hunger, same diet. Constipation set in.Day 545 minutes after taking the pill, felt great for 5 hours and got hungry. Woke up after 8 hours and felt ok. 3 hours of feeling a little weird and a successful BM, my brain turned back on all the way and hunger came back again. Balance much better.

22,Citalopram,Generalized Anxiety Disorder,10.0,,"December 8, 2020",27,"Hello! This citalopram is a miracle drug. I started having anxiety at the age of 15, which progressed and got worse at 16. I am now 18. I started having panic attacks and they kept getting worse, to the point where it was every time I left the house. They got so bad I felt like I was having a stroke. I spoke to the doctor and they started me on 10 mg of Citalopram. I haven’t noticed any side effects. Within 1 week of using, I noticed citalopram having a positive effect. I have been using it slightly over 2 weeks and I barely have panic attacks anymore. About every 4 days now, I still have 14 more pills before it’s supposed to fully work. When I started having anxiety it got worse when I smoked weed. When the effects got too intense, I would freak out and have a panic attack. I quit using weed while I got onto citalopram, and also quit alcohol, which of course was hard but totally worth it!",Victor

I exercise daily which helps. Overall I am pleased with the results but suggest you do not drink alcohol,  reduce coffee intake, exercise, sleep over 7 hours and ensure you are self aware not to put oneself in stressful situations. Life is too short not to enjoy the journey . It can and it does get better but educate yourself on what you have and the triggers and your responses to life events",Tony

I felt odd for almost a month before the side affects lessened. My mind raced all the time, so my doctor upped the dose to 40mg after being on 20mg for a few months. I stayed on it from June 2019 until January 2020. During this period I never once felt any relief from anxiety or stress. Actually, I was more on the edge than ever. February 1st I stopped cold turkey without any withdrawal symptoms...I mean NONE! After a few weeks off this stuff my mind started to settle down and I could concentrate again. While on Citalopram I could not absorb and retain information. I consider this experiment a complete waste, and wish I had never been talked into starting it...total disaster.",Luke

I struggled to even sit in a car for a 5 minute drive at times it was so bad. Didn’t go on holiday for 6 years as couldn’t pull myself to get on a plane. Anxiety attacks were common and happened about 4-5 times a week. Finally I thought enough was enough and went to the doctors. Was prescribed 20mg  citalopram for 6 weeks. Nothing happened so the doctor increased to 30mg. After 8 weeks the anxiety stopped. I didn’t feel any different day to day, only the anxiety attacks would not start. Been on for 3 months now and still not had an anxiety attack. It has completely changed my life, and was even able to fly to Germany to go abroad for the first time since the anxiety started.

32,Citalopram,Generalized Anxiety Disorder,10.0,,"December 3, 2019",31,"One of the best decisions I've made. I was suicidal for the last year and reached the point where I would think about it for 6hrs each day paralysed in bed. I was always sceptical of pharmaceutical medication. I believed that doctors are just legal drug dealers (if you look into history doctors in the 1950's prescribed cocaine to house wife's and more recently the Xanax epidemic in the USA = an opioid. and lead me to the conclusion, that doctors have no idea what they're doing.) But the prescribed medication citalopram along with therapy helped me to stop my paranoid obsessive episodes of cynicism. The first couple weeks are horrific. But if you power through, the benefits are extraordinary. A new found appreciation for life. I noticed staying active during the trial stage (the first month) helped to reduce symptoms e.g. studies, work and gym.

I can go months without a single panic attack now. I originally started on 10mg, but have been on a dose of 20mg for the past two years. The only real side effect I noticed was lack of sex drive for the first few months. Please listen to your doctor and your body, they know what is best for you. For me it was an absolute life changer!

Some believe that 10mg is not a therapeutic dose and that 20mg is more effective.Almost at 4 weeks on this medication (only about 2 weeks at my full dose). I’ve always considered myself a happy person, but just been dealing with a sudden onset of anxiety throughout the day. My mood improved very quickly as did my energy. The anxiety has definitely improved but I still get some when driving or at random times but it is manageable. Hoping that more time on the meds will improve these situations. Side effects for the first two days were brain fog and a ‘heavy’ feeling in my head.

I put off taking meds my whole life. I’m 68 and my son swears by this drug which is why I tried it.

The first couple of weeks consisted of insomnia, nausea, burning of my arms, anxiety and I lost about 20 lbs. I was scared to leave my house. After about a month or so I became better. I was able to leave the house, my appetite was better and also my mood. I've been taking 20 mg. I increased to 30 mg and then I went back to 20mg. I'm now breaking the pill in half and taking half in the morning and half at night along with Atarax 10 mg for anxiety. Overall, I'm 80% better. Give the medicine a shot.

Depression with passing suicidal thoughts? Panic attacks? Me too. All due to stress! This stuff citalopram works (for me) It takes time! Be patient! Only read good reviews as it prolongs it working with reading negative stuff. I'm on my 5th week and I'm managing to go to the supermarket for the first time in months. I can drop my boy off at nursery with having a panic attack. I can do my gigs now without thinking everybody hates me and packing up mid gig. The benefits out weigh the side effects for me. I had big pupils, sweaty nights, crazy dreams and heightened anxiety for a few weeks. Honestly this stuff is a miracle. I tried to go the natural way for months before with no joy and sometimes meds are needed. You are not weak! You are taking the right steps by asking for medical help. The stigma around these drugs is nonsense as everyone is different and these meds saves lives. Simple!",RIG

I was never in a good mood, and always extremely impatient and irritable. I began citalopram, and I noticed an incredible difference within days. The doctor said there was no way this was possible and I could possibly just be experiencing placebo effect but It was such a significant difference that I am sure It was already working. The only downside of this drug was that the side effects began the very first day I started it. I never had much trouble sleeping before taking it but the first night I took the drug I did not sleep for a single minute. It took a couple of days to get any significant sleep at all. I also had no appetite for about a week and lost about 5 pounds that week. After that first week the side effects were non-existent and everything was well. I have been on citalopram for about 2 years and have had nothing to complain about after the first week. hope this is helpful",zach

Whilst no doubt if you can manage the side effects it can work, be also wary about the long term effects and the withdrawal symptoms.

78,Citalopram,Generalized Anxiety Disorder,9.0,,"July 16, 2018",21,"Overall the 40mg tablet of Citalopram has been very helpful with GAD and related depression. I was originally on the 20mg and around 12 months ago had my dose increased to 40mg. My symptoms have decreased significantly from what I would call fairly strong GAD and my mood improved overall to a very  stable level. I found in the first weeks and months adjusting to the medication there were episodes of anger unrelated to anything happening in my life, which can be unsettling but it does pass. There were also times when I had general lethargy, almost like the flu, which only lasted 4-5 days.I would also add there was a strangeness to some of my thoughts. If anyone goes through something like that, don't worry it will eventually settle down!The Citalopram also helps reduce the impact of certain negative thoughts.

I felt really awful for the first 3 weeks, my anxiety got worse. Had a fuzzy head ache for 5 hours after taking med, I felt terrible. The Dr said it would take 3 months to really take effect. He was correct. As I remember after 5 weeks I could really feel the difference. You can’t evaluate the true benefit of the med for a long time. The side effects gradually go away. I can’t believe there is a med that could help me feel like my old self again. I did not take the full dose at first. I ramped up gradual with time. Stay the course, be patient! If after 5 weeks you don’t feel better you may have to change to another med. If you don’t give it a chance, you can quite and go back to feeling miserable.",Luvlif

89,Citalopram,Generalized Anxiety Disorder,1.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"February 25, 2018",6,"I was prescribed Citalopram at the age of 17. I took the medication for about 5 years, and can’t recall it ever helping me with anxiety or depression. When I stopped taking Citalopram, the withdrawals were horrible. The intense withdrawals and side effects lasted about 3 months. Mild withdrawals and side effects lasted another 3 months. After the 6 months of uncomfortable withdrawals, I had occasional side effects that lasted another 6 months. Exercising often releases your body’s stored endorphins and seratonin. For me, working out and staying active boosts my mood and makes me feel good. At times, it is difficult to find a way to decrease my anxiety. One method that does help, is to recite positive affirmations about myself. It takes my mind off of the anxiety, and reminds myself I am a strong, loving, and kind person. I hope that my experience can help you, and prevent you from going through the horrible withdrawals that I suffered from.",Paul H.

For two plus years now I am free of these afflictions and live a happy well adjusted life! For me the results started immediately,  maybe a little too much results at first.  The biggest shock is that the day after I started taking the medication, I  physically saw myself differently in the mirror. This was a huge step to overcoming my anorexia. I no longer dwelled  on the motor mirror or cried all the time and my general anxiety was quelled. My mind was no longer racing and focusing on negatives. After 8  weeks I felt like a normal person.",Liz Adkins
