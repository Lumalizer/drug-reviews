0,Sertraline,Generalized Anxiety Disorder,1.0,,"March 28, 2022",0,Didn’t like this drug at all . Maybe helped with the anxiety but as I was taking it alongside therapy it’s hard to tell. As I’m a night worker my sleep pattern is not the norm but it’s been manageable for 20 + years . Early into taking this medication I realised it was affecting my sleep and made me feel desensitised to everything around me. I only took it for 10 days before I stopped. I’ve stopped taking it 6 eewks ago but still suffering with insomnia. Although the sertraline is out of my system my GP thinks the drug has triggered it. It’s hard times for me at present working 5 nights a week  and trying to find relief for my insomnia . I come home from work in a morning and think today is the day when things may start to get better . Sadly it wasn’t today maybe it will be tomorrow !!!Wish I’d never taken sertraline my sleep was never a problem for me until then.Can’t even rate it as the therapy could have had a lot  to do with combating the anxiety .,Julis
1,Sertraline,Generalized Anxiety Disorder,8.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"March 25, 2022",2,"After suffering from anxiety since 2019, I had decided to try Sertraline in April 2021 and from day one I noticed change. The first night was awful. But it slowly started to get better. I upped the dosage from 25 to 50 mg. And after 6 weeks I was feeling much better but not 100%. Then from 50mg-75mg. That was tough for 4/5 weeks then it began to feel better but still not 100%. Then in August last year I went from 75-100 mg. I definitely felt better when I implemented some lifestyle changes. But I’m still yet to feel 100%. On 100 mg, there are some days where I feel completely normal. But some days I get the physical symptoms I used to get before I took the meds. I know for a fact that I felt better each time I increased the dose. So I’ll probably go up to 125 or even higher if necessary.  Regardless of how rocky I have been all year, Sertraline has helped me tremendously. My advice is to follow the guidance of your therapist. There is an end date to your struggles. God bless.",30yo Male 
2,Sertraline,Generalized Anxiety Disorder,9.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"March 24, 2022",1,"I got put on 25mg of Setraline about 2 months ago after being diagnosed with Generalized Anxiety Disorder. I had only recently been getting panic attacks and once it started effecting my everyday life I knew I needed to get help right away. I have had depression for about 3 years but went unmedicated because it usually was just during the winter where it was really bad. I live in a very rainy state where half the year is gloomy so I was sort of set up to have depression just from that. But once I started getting panic attacks doing everyday things I knew it was time to try a medication. To my surprise the first week went very well, my mind was so quiet for the first time in forever. And now 2 months later I have done everything that I was struggling to do before without issue (work, grocery trips, going out to eat in public etc). This medication had really helped me. I will add that I am also on an as needed prescription if I do feel like I am getting panicky. (Hydroxyzine 10mg)",Lilpisces
3,Sertraline,Generalized Anxiety Disorder,9.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"March 6, 2022",2,"I struggled for twelve months with severe anxiety and it got so bad that I ended up with moderate depression too. I didn't like the thought of going on medication and tried everything to heal myself ‘naturally’. I meditated daily, ate a healthy diet, read endless self help books, took magnesium and fish oil supplements, practiced mindfulness…. You name it I did it! The final straw was a weekend away to our favourite place. Normally being there took all my anxiety away but not this time. I had a panic attack and spent all week crying. The next day I made an appointment  with my doctor who prescribed me 50mg Zoloft. Day 12,13 and 14 were the hardest with increased anxiety and diarrhoea. I visited here daily to read the encouraging reviews. Day 15 everything changed, a calm came over me. From then on it continued to get better. By week 5 I felt completely well. Don’t suffer unnecessarily! There is help",Catholicmom
4,Sertraline,Generalized Anxiety Disorder,10.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"March 1, 2022",4,"I have been on sertraline for 10½ weeks now, 2½ weeks at 50mg and 8 weeks at 100mg. This drug is amazing, though the initial side effects can be rough (increased anxiety, insomnia, hand tremors, nausea, headaches, bruising more easily). The worst for me were the anxiety uptick and the insomnia but my G.P. gave me clonazepam (0.25mg twice daily or as needed). I used the clonazepam for about 6 weeks on and off and they were a great help. The side effects are only temporary so, please, hang in there. Give sertraline time (at least 8 weeks) to build up in your system before deciding whether to continue, or not. I am so glad I constantly read and re-read the positive reviews on here when I was battling through the first few weeks. I feel like a different person now. Anxiety practically non-existent, I am calmer, more able to cope with stress and  generally happier all round. This medication made me realise that God can, and does, use ""big pharma"" to help people with chemical imbalances.",1 Corinthians 5 v21
5,Sertraline,Generalized Anxiety Disorder,4.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"February 27, 2022",1,"Been struggling with anxiety for quite some time but it was manageable.  Once covid hit I went down fast, anxiety led into panic attacks. I eventually went to the doctor and she prescribed 50mg, well that first night was horrific to the point I passed out and landed face first on the floor eventually waking up to my wife freaking out.  Went back to the doctor and she suggested 12.5mg for a week.  I have to say I'm paranoid to take them,  they are sitting on my counter.  I need something to get my life back.  I'm hoping after all this reading I can try again.",Anonymous
6,Sertraline,Generalized Anxiety Disorder,10.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"February 22, 2022",4,"After quitting lexapro suddenly without weaning off, due to it causing intense episodes of psychosis and anxiety and suicidal thoughts after a few months of use, I was in an even worse place than I started off with. Constant nasty feeling inside, paranoid, extremely nervous, panicky, very suicidal, just fed up of having to deal with the intense dread and fear every day. After a few months of this suffering, I finally said I need to go to the doctor to see if there is anything she could do, she said sertraline would be a good option to try. I was terrified of medication due to what lexapro did, so I didnt take the sertraline until 3 days after it was prescribed. When I took it, my own paranoia sent me into a horrible state of anxiety ,ended up in emergency department. Long story short, after an absolute grind and mental battle, My anxiety is almost non existant. Honestly unbelievable. Try it, if its not for you, try something else.something will work. Best decision of my life :)",Kris

8,Sertraline,Generalized Anxiety Disorder,10.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"February 7, 2022",2,"After I had my baby, I really started dealing with postpartum anxiety and depression. I've had a history of anxiety and depression anyway, but I thought I was dealing fairly well on my own. Postpartum put me over the edge, though. I talked to my midwife at my follow-up appointment and she prescribed this. I was too nervous to even start taking it right away. I was afraid of the side effects and afraid it would affect my baby since I breastfeed. I finally decided about a month before I returned to work that I should bite the bullet and start. That was the best thing I could have done. I feel better mentally than I have in years. I've been on it for about 2 months now, and I'm not noticing any negative side effects.",Ambrd

10,Sertraline,Generalized Anxiety Disorder,9.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"February 3, 2022",5,"I took approx 12.5mg for 2 weeks and then upped to 25mg last week. I felt like there was no way out before, I had suicidal thoughts and feelings, panic attacks, rushing thoughts.  For the first 10 days I had horrid side effects, but 3 weeks on life is easier.  I still get some mild anxiety but it is early days, and it lasts about 5 minutes, however I smile now, I can clean and cook, I’m patient with my son, I laugh more, I catch myself smiling and it warms my heart. I’ve always had negative reactions to meds, so I weaned in gently, and fought through the hard 10 days and now I’m so happy I did. I feel like a human! I get bored due to not being busy fighting my anxiety!! I thought nothing could help me, I was too far gone, no meds could help etc..but here I am, I am alive and living and not just surviving! Please don’t give up. Sertraline can save lives, I wish I started  it sooner. I’m in a refuge so had support from staff when it was hard at first, please have support for the first week or so",Nicole

12,Sertraline,Generalized Anxiety Disorder,10.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"January 24, 2022",1,"I never used to suffer from Anxiety or depression.  There was a build up of a few events in my life and out of the blue I had a panic attack.  After that I suffered with continuous anxiety.  It was debilitating and then I started falling into a mild depression.  I went to see my psychiatrist and she started me on 25mg sertraline for 4 days and then 50mg onwards.  For the first week I didn't really feel any better or worse.  I had a bit of a stomach upset from the medication and felt a little weird in my head, but after two weeks the side effects went away. I did not experience any heavy side affects for which I am very grateful for. After 4 weeks on 50mg I really felt like I was getting back to myself.  In the beginning it felt like this was something that was going to beat me. But I kept on doing things that made me feel better and kept with the medication.  It really helps. Include, exercise,  yoga, Omega EPH 1000mg, CBT training with doctors permission of course.",Brent
13,Sertraline,Generalized Anxiety Disorder,8.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"January 17, 2022",2,"Male 37 years old. Try Cipralex 10 mg for 48 hours which was the worst days of my life. Looks like a serotonin syndrome. My GP made me try sertraline instead. Starts at 25 mg after one week I upgrade to 50mg, after a couple of days I decided to get back at 25mg because of extreme agitation in the morning and other side effects. It start to make a difference I would say after 6 complete weeks and I'm at almost 9 complete weeks and it goes better by the time, better mood but nothing disconnected from a normal mood, which this is what I wanted. I got, over the course of these weeks, a lot of side effect, the main one was Insomnia, it finally go away but it take time (about 6 weeks). Feel less and less agitated in the morning. Still stuck with loose stools every morning but if this the only remaining side effect I will live with it.",Fred
14,Sertraline,Generalized Anxiety Disorder,8.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"January 13, 2022",1,"I started on Sertraline just over 2 weeks ago having suffered from panic attacks that had resulted in me going to A&E (ER for my American readers!) 4 times over the last 12 months. The majority of my anxiety was related to health concerns... this despite being a pretty healthy and fit 38 year old. The first 3 days on Sertraline were quite bad, however I had anticipated this as I had originally been given citalopram and had such a bad reaction, I'd stopped after 5 days. I had a range of side effects including loss of appetite, nausea, headaches, tight chest, anxiety and fatigue. These started to ease after day 4 but it was up and down. Now into week 2 I am feeling a lot better. Most side effects have gone and I generally feel in a better mood with very limited anxious feelings. Still early days but I wanted to post as the comments on this site helped me through that first initial struggle. It does get better, so please stick with it!",JtotheT
15,Sertraline,Generalized Anxiety Disorder,10.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"December 26, 2021",4,"I have been formally diagnosed with GAD and OCD surrounding intrusive thoughts. I was prescribed 50mg of Sertraline daily to help relieve my symptoms, and I can honestly say that it has helped saved my life. Other antidepressants I've tried in the past made me feel ""funny"", tired, irritable, some made me feel nothing at all. The only side effect I experienced taking Sertraline was mild nausea which subsided within a few weeks.Sertraline helped me to get out of my lowest point in life. My GAD and OCD will always be with me, I know this as I've tried to come off medication before and it has always persisted. But Sertraline has assisted in taking the edge off my symptoms, helped me rationalise my intrusive thoughts and thinking patterns, has helped me sleep better, and has even slightly shifted the ""rock in the stomach feeling"" that many sufferers of anxiety feel. As said before, it has saved my life. I will never discontinue this medication.",Sal
16,Sertraline,Generalized Anxiety Disorder,8.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"December 3, 2021",13,"Hi Where to start !! I had been diagnosed at 55 with GAD had it since I was 7 I am now 60. I had a meltdown in mid September akin to a breakdown I wanted to die the hole was so deep and dark . Doc prescribed me sertraline and over 3 weeks increased dose to 150mg, believe everything you read about this drug the side effects were horrific, mind like a washing machine, intrusive thoughts, grueling insomnia, no appetite for 8 weeks , diarrhea, sweating , I truly thought there was no way out and because you don’t have a GP on speed dial reading and re reading forums about this drug to comfort me in the knowledge that it works…Good news !! It appeared to kick in, for hours at first, then a day here and there, nothing permanent but I found myself humming to the radio or watching the Telly with no intrusive dark thought,  for me it did take the 12 weeks and if you are willing to persevere it is TRULY worth it … you’ve come this far reading my experience YOU CAN DO IT !!",Ivyrae2014
17,Sertraline,Generalized Anxiety Disorder,6.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"December 2, 2021",0,Hey guys! I'm a 20-year-old female I have PTSD and GAD which has made life a lot more difficult the past 3 years and after avoiding meds for so long I finally caved and decided to give Zoloft an injection since my depression has gotten pretty bad since I moved. This medication honestly gave me a lot of side effects and I'm only on 25mg. It's given me really bad hot flashes where I have woken up extremely sweaty in the middle of the night. I also have been experiencing derealization while taking this where I feel like I'm zoned out and can't really process the world around me. It's given me more energy and made me feel calmer and collected at times but there have been moments where I can't get out of bed because I feel so tired and nauseous. I've had to take naps in the middle of the day because of how tired and sick it has made me feel but I'm hoping the side effects wear off once my body gets used to it since it has been a little over a month for me.,Tay

22,Sertraline,Generalized Anxiety Disorder,8.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"September 16, 2021",1,"Went on sertraline back in 2016, and it literally was a hard pill to swallow given all of the side effects.  Increased anxiety, pitting feeling in my stomach, couldn't sleep, you name it. Started with 12.5mg and slowly titrated up to 75mg, which was apparently my therapeutic dose?   Hard to say, because the side effects never subsided as I titrated up.   Now I believe 50mg or even 25mg would have done the trick.  Either way it worked and I gradually got better after slowly titrating up after 3 long months.  An interesting recent studies show that people who are poor or slow metabolizers get more side effects.  One way I found out I was a slow metabolizer was actually from an article on coffee that stated slow metabolizers feel the effects of caffeine more since the it stays in their system longer.   Got off  sertraline a few years back, and of course my anxiety and GAD returned.  So, if you are a slow metabolizer, you may get side effects and you may want to start on a small dose.",John

25,Sertraline,Generalized Anxiety Disorder,10.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"August 18, 2021",10,"Part 2 continued from above: However, the side effects are all very short term and I can't describe how much they have helped me over the past months. They say the first few weeks are tough and I thought how could things get much worse... Well they do, however, if you can hold out past the 8-10 weeks, it's game changing. My social anxiety gone from a 9 to a 3. I'm rebuilding relationships and am more present in the moment. I never felt more at peace in my life. After 10 years of struggle I wish I started them sooner.

Dreading being called out to read to the class, giving presentations, meeting new people or being the center of attention was always a huge fear of mine. I was and still am against medication as a quick fix to life's problems. I have been avoiding anti depressants for year's. Trying alternative treatments to name a few; counselling, therapy (three times from 6-12 months a go), cold water exposure every morning for 3 months in a lake, yoga for 3 years, micro dosing on magic mushrooms, boxing, running, gym and meditation to name a few. However, I always felt one step forwards and two back over the last 10 years.At the age of 24 I decided to look into anti depressants again. Reading the reviews made me nervous.

My OBGYN prescribed me Lexapro at 19. I took it for probably a year. It worked well. Then life happened and along the way the panic attacks and daily anxiety came back. I went back to my OB who suggested wellbutrin. THAT WAS TERRIBLE for me!! I did not do well, I actually ended up breaking out in hives along with all the other side effects you can experience. So I decided to try out a psychiatrist who would have a little more information to work with. She recommended I try zoloft since the Lexapro had worked so many years earlier. I will say the first two weeks are ALWAYS a nightmare. I keep a journal each time I start so I can go back and remind myself, yes this sucks and is scary, but you've been here before and it does get better. I am currently on day 6 at 50mg.

I experienced some of the initial side effects: increased anxiety, insomnia, headaches, shakiness, jaw pain and dizziness. But all eventually went away after a month or so of use. My husband noticed a difference in me around week 4, but I didn’t really notice much of a change until week 6/7. Honestly, I wasn’t even sure the medicine was truly working until about 12 weeks in. I have had a lot of ups and downs, but the downs have been less often since about week 4.  Now at a little over 14 weeks, I feel like things have really leveled out for me. I still feel emotions. I cry, I laugh, I joke around, I get excited for family outings. All of the normal feelings are back. I don’t feel emotionally blunted. The side effects can be tough in the beginning… and from my experience, the doors and windows don’t start to open very quickly. But once they do, it can feel really incredible.",Madkat

I was determined to stick with it. I’m glad I did. After a week each day I felt better. It’s been a year since I started it and I feel amazing.

I took it for many years and it kept anxiety at bay and I was relatively happy (with the odd set back). There is a BUT though, and that is the long term side effects that I (and others I know) have suffered with. The price I paid for taking the drug is regular debilitating headaches, major gastric reflux issues and excessive sweating. I was in a high dose and eventually, decided to stop gradually in 2020. That was a living nightmare! The discontinuation symptoms are seriously bad. I was on 200mg a day and reduced it very slowly over about six weeks but the symptoms were very bad, flu like, aches and pains etc. I succeeded after a couple of months and felt great but 6 months later, I've relapsed!

My GP said that the fact I am getting some positive results by week 4 is a really good sign and she gave me the choice of staying on 50mgs to see how much I improved in the next couple of weeks or just bite the bullet and try 100mgs - which I’ve done. I have also been  drinking some alcohol some nights which is absolutely fine. There is no interaction at all. I just want to be back to normal. I’ve had so much stress in the last few years that I’ve lost my personality, and I can’t wait to get it back and to be happy and fun again. Definitely feel like I’m on the way! ",Eilidh

I felt like they first helped me to cope with my periods. Mood swings etc. They definitely helped with social anxiety but in the past 2 weeks, I felt that they are making me feel worse in relation to depression. It had worsened. Doctor said I should try 100mg but  but he's not right. I know what I feel. They have helped me for a while whilst I needed them, but now I don't feel depressed and anxiety is so much better to control that I just want to come off them to start feeling normal again. If you're only mildly depressed then I would advise against them. I try sports instead. When on sertraline, I was detached and zoned out, which at first felt good but now it's worse. Everyone is different so this is just my opinion. I just listen to my body and mind and feel that the doctors don't know what's exactly right for me.

I've had general anxiety and panic disorder my entire life, but I started it after a rough couple of years and an especially rough couple of months when I was willing to try anything if it would make me feel normal again. For me, zoloft has taken away the feelings of anxiety almost completely. I still feel anxious in some long-term situations that are hard for me, but for the most part, I can do so much more than I used to be able to because I don't constantly feel plagued by fear anymore. I've had two panic attacks on zoloft in a period of about a year, and both were much easier for me to recover from than the panic attacks I had when I wasn't on medication. I do have some sexual side effects (mild), and I have a much lower tolerance for alcohol than I used to (and I get worse hangovers). I'm really really happy that I tried this medication, and I would strongly recommend it to others with generalized anxiety and panic disorder.",Louise

I still feel a bit anxious every now and then but I can actually now think positive thoughts and think about the future, which for the last 4 months I was a nervous wreck, I couldn't go out, I couldn't move off the sofa, I couldn't eat (lost 4 stone in 2 months ) my anxiety was so bad I thought I would be better off not being here, I didn't want to see or be around anyone from the way I was feeling, but it can now see light at the end of a VERY DARK tunnel. It took me 3 wks to pluck the courage to take them and I'm so glad I did. THEY WORK!",VIXtar
196,Sertraline,Generalized Anxiety Disorder,8.0,Taken for 10 years or more,"December 30, 2014",31,"I started taking Zoloft in 1993 after 5 years of intense suffering from anxiety which led to depression. I had relentlessly recurring unpleasant thoughts that I could not control, starting from just a moment after I'd wake up in the morning and continuing all day, leaving me exhausted. The demands of my first professional job and impending marriage broke me and I finally agreed to use medication. I went on 50mg and after 3 weeks it felt like a miracle occurred. I put my troubles behind me and immediately got on with life. I still had breakthrough anxiety and had lots of supplemental meds over the years, such as Buspar and Trazodone, and Zoloft to 75,100,150 mg. I settled on 100mg 10 years ago. I use Clonazepam rarely when it gets intense.",crun3

I also had an eating disorder, and I was put on Zyprexa for food related anxiety. Zyprexa made me into a zombie, but once I recovered I took Zoloft for my anxiety and love it! It has put all of the little worries in my life into perspective and helped me handle disappointment and stress much better. I don't get hungry very often, but I rarely feel nauseous. My social life has gone up a lot since I've taken this, and I sleep like a baby at night. My only complaint is that I get incredibly energetic and distracted easily and do not respond well if I don't take it for a couple days. Love it though!",iccake10

I am a natural happy and outgoing woman, but due to pressure and high expectations, I guess,  I started feeling anxious and sad all the time. I used to feel chest tightness, rapid palpitations and fear to fail or not do good in life and eventually become a failure. I remember I used to get horrible headaches on a daily basis and even stomach issues. Mind you, I even had a colonoscopy and endoscopy done due to the severity of the digestive problem although the results were okay. Also, I hadinsomia and fatigue. I must confess that all those terrible ""symptoms"" went away once I started taking this medicine. My mood has improved and I've noticed that I am much happier.",brendiszz

I am a 36 yr old mother of two & suddenly I started having panic attacks.  I was so scared to start taking Zoloft because I thought it would ""change"" me, or make me feel ""off.""  This was SO not the case! I tried everything natural I could first-- but I was still having anxiety regularly. I was also having negative thoughts that I could not stop, I would have to actively try not to think about certain things, and I really struggled with that.  I have been on Zoloft about 2 weeks and all of that has stopped!  I feel happy! I didn't even realize I had been in a funk, I feel so so SO much better now.

I switched about 6 months ago to sertraline, and started on a tiny dose of 25 mg which didn't help very much. I am currently on 50 mg and the difference has been wonderful. I stopped freaking out about everything, crying for no reason, shaking, feeling faint, or any of the other awful things that come with anxiety. This dose has worked well for the past 6 months, however I notice it is becoming slightly less effective, so I'm going to bump it up to 75 mg. All in all, though, sertraline works very well for me personally.",emjay95

It was when I kept forgetting to get my prescription refilled and it got to the point where it was about 2 weeks without it and I was very emotional and depressed. Not suicidal Just depressed. Probably 10 times worse then when I started the medication. It was very bad. Just take your medication and you should be fine. I missed a few days after that once or twice and nothing out of the ordinary happened. It was only because I went off for so long without weaning myself off. Overall great!",Anonymous

I have done okay with life's normal challenges, but the underlying anxiety was always there and I was constantly struggling against it.  I just lived with it.  If it got especially bad, I took Xanax or Ativan, but you can't use those long term.  Finally I let the doc prescribe sertraline.  (My husband had been set against it-he thought if I exercised more, all this would go away....but I couldn't exercise more....my anxiety made me tired all the time). Once I got past the first three weeks and started to see the difference, I was amazed.

Suicidal thoughts decreased dramatically and  I became much easier to get along with; no more getting all worked up over minor issues, less intense and hyper-reactive to every little thing. Less worrying and fretting. Huge increase in ability to focus/concentrate, especially ability to read again without my mind distracted and reading the same sentence over and over.

Finally my family forced me to go to the doctor and she told me that because of my upcoming life events (getting married, starting a new career, moving out) and because of my Type A personality, it's likely I have a slight chemical imbalance in my brain which could be causing my extreme nausea.

I started on 100mg, and have since gone down to daily 25mg tablets combined with 150mg of Wellbutrin XL daily, which in my personal opinion is a far more effective medication in that it doesn't tend to slow down the rate of someones introverted thought.
