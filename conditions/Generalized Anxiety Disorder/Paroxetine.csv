I’ve been on Paxil for 11 year now for anxiety and depression at the time. I recently tried weaning off it and had all the side effects everyone on here is talking about brain zaps, severe anxiety, bad depression. I didn’t really know that was part of the withdrawal process I just thought it was my depression. I was put back on it and ever since I was put back on it I feel small boned, joints feel small, I feel like my structure shrunk and feel sucked up. I went to see an endocrinologist please if anyone else has anything that can relate to this or help let me know.",Joe_6161

When I started taking it I was sick for the first 3 weeks, but overall it helped ease my anxiety and depression. I gained 15 kg on it, which was horrible. Also my sex drive disappeared completely, which sucked. Then once I tried to stop taking it (with help from my doctor) it became a literal nightmare. I quit a couple weeks ago and I've been having severe withdrawal symptoms. I have been experiencing severe nausea, non stop, can't keep food down, sweating, brain zaps, overall it feels like I have the worst flu. Now the only options are going back on the meds or switching to a different anti depressant that will eventually have less withdrawal symptoms.. Overall kind of a crappy experience.",beckym

Most of the years I’ve been able to manage it with meditation, spiritual podcasts, and therapy. But in 2020 my anxiety took a turn for the worse. For over a year, almost 18 months, I felt absolutely miserable. My fight and flight was constantly on. I couldn’t sleep unless medicated. I started feeling very angry and could barely get off the couch at the end of a work day, because it took so much energy to keep my cool at work. I finally gave in and consulted a psychiatrist. She diagnosed me again with major anxiety disorder and also with moderate depression, even though I was not sad, but the anger I felt was a huge symptom. I started with Zoloft , but started to lose all my hair , had major jaw clenching, and also trouble sleeping. 8 weeks ago we changed to Paxil 20mg. I feel amazing. I no longer have daily panic attacks, rumination, intrusive thoughts, and get a full night sleep every night. am excelling at work. No side effects.",Lux

The first week (which I know is the most intense for all SSRIS) was just so hard. My jaw was shaking uncontrollably, I was extremely tiered and I would fall asleep almost anywhere, I had extreme anxiety and sweating. However, I spoke to my psychiatrist who told me to continue as the side effects would subside. So I kept on, and yes the side effects did subside but 4 months in I still felt extremely fatigue. I was a long distance runner and even going for a walk became a challenge for me. I would sleep 8/9 hours a night and still found it incredibly difficult to wake up and I'd need a 2 hour nap in the day (thankfully I work from home). It was difficult for me to socialise, put on clothes and other basic day to day tasks. My jaw was also still shaking and in 4 months I had gained weight (lack of movement I assume). I do believe the anxiety subsided, but the side effects themselves gave me anxiety, especially the fatigue.",Melissaamy

There was a point in time where I couldn't drive without getting a panic attack, after years on Paxil, I barely even think about it when I get in my car.  One thing that surprised me to learn is that Paxil is an antidepressant.  I always figured Paxil was essentially a depressant with the way that it treats anxiety symptoms.  Personally, for me, Paxil does nothing for my depression.  Given the choice of treating my anxiety or depression, it's a very easy decision.  My depression ranges from mild to average, makes it difficult to be interested in things, get out of bed in the morning, interact with friends, etc.  My anxiety makes it almost impossible to live a normal life.I would definitely be interested to know if there's something that can be paired with Paxil that doesn't affect its ability to treat anxiety but helps with depression.",TraceAbandon

I cannot comment on long term use but I would like to share my symptom experience as it’s been a wild ride. Firstly, my anxiety has heightened ten fold, I find myself having panic attacks in public and frequently shaking involuntarily mainly in my hands. I also experienced an extremely tense jaw and facial muscles to the point where it would make me more anxious that I was making weird faces. Generally restless and feel very very weird as if I’m having an outer body experience. I have brief moments of calmness where I feel my anxiety has lessened to an extent where I can deal with it, but then I take it again and symptoms come back. I also experience auditory hallucinations, doctor has told me this is not a normal symptom and may stem from my younger age where I did used to have these severely.

I always felt as though instead of me controlling my thoughts, my thoughts would control me. I couldn’t stand another day feeling this constant apprehension so, I started on 10 mg and I started to feel a difference in my anxiety around week 3-4. Although my symptoms had decreased, I experienced a whole lot of side effects. To name a few: anhedonia, indifference (apathy), emotional numbness, derealization, depersonalization, dry mouth, diarrhea, low sex drive, increased appetite, changes in taste, yawning, drowsiness, mild sore throat, etc. I increased from 10 mg to 20 mg in order to treat the anhedonia, it did relieve it to an extent but I then felt too apathetic. I went back down to 10 and eventually discontinued due to other lingering side effects. Although this medication did calm me down and reduce my anxiety, I’d recommend trying this medication as a last resort! Try Lexapro before trying this one.",AnxiousBoy123 (A.L.)

I was in the darkest place of my life with anxiety and depression when I went for my last resort: medication. My doctor recommended a low dose of paroxetine. It only took 5 days and my mood, outlook, and anxiety went from black to white. This isn't placebo because I was hopeless before it started working. I'm lucky to have a quick response. The 5 days were miserable in terms of my anxiety and mood, but worth it. I can now drive again, leave the house, be alone. I have hope again. The first month I had annoying side effects: brain fog, drowsiness, sleepiness, forgetfulness. After a while it went away. The only side effect I have now is hypersomnia, but I don't mind it at all. I actually read a peer-reviewed article saying people who experience hypersomnia on paroxetine have a better response to the drug.",bee

Once I was on it for a few years I started waking with headaches and noticed I was clenching my jaw quite a bit.  I got a dental device to help with the jaw clenching which helped temporarily.  Then I tried a lower dose which helped for a while but then my anxiety would get worse I'd up the med and the clenching increased.

I feel you have to treat it like a vitamin,  thinking  that the pill will fix everything can make you a typical pessimist, however, effects are really noticeable around the 3-4 week period. My experience is a more stable mood, diminished social anxiety, and more energy. I began to see improvements in the threshold for my emotions. It would take me a lot longer to become upset or anxious about something. It is not as if the feeling is gone but you become less stimulated by your environment. Things that really were stressful and important to me became petty and easier to manage. I have taken Lexapro, Prozac, and Effexor and I think Paxil has been the best overall SSRI.",Ryandawg

Recently, I've been preparing for a CT Scan and I think it's caused my anxiety to spike again. I'm staying positive and trying to face the reality that my worry is the cause of the anxiety. I know the full effect with Paxil doesn't kick in until 3 months and I am going to stay on it to benefit from it. Like I said, it's been a tremendous blessing, but still got a hill to climb.

I also developed an ulcer and was diagnosed with severe Irritable Bowel Syndrome. My doctor decided to place me back on Paxil. After being on for 6 months, I feel absolutely wonderful.

But, of course, that wasn't a reasonable ore or comfortable way to be treated, so I told the psychiatrist I didn't want the Paxil. And unlike what most folks here experienced, I became anorexic instead of gaining weight.  I had no interest in eating at all. As a result, I lost about 10 lbs in 2 weeks, and I was only about 115 lbs to start. My pain doctor has just given me a sample of Cymbalta.

Alcohol abuse was almost certainly the cause of it's ineffectiveness & I have learned my lesson. Many negative reviews on the web describe the severe withdrawal symptoms. I count myself lucky that Paxil worked wonders for me WITHOUT any withdrawal periods. Not everyone experiences this withdrawal so if you're here reading experiences & worrying about possible future withdrawal don't assume it will happen to you. I am now on mirtazapine which is ok but I really miss the feel good 'boost' & confidence that Paxil gave me. I used to call this my 'serotonin high'.
