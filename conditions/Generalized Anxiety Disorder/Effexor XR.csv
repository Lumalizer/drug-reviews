0,Effexor XR,Generalized Anxiety Disorder,8.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"March 22, 2022",0,"This is the first medicine I have taken that has greatly lessened depression, generalized anxiety, obsessions, and dpdr. SSRI’s were no good for me.  I titrated up slowly. Once I got to 150 mg, anxiety and panic was greatly reduced. I’m at 187.5 mg now. The medicine does come with side effects. High blood pressure, which I take medicine for so I can stay on Effexor. Low libido on the low doses but it has gone up a bit once you go up in dose. Idk if this is a side effect from Effexor or my dpdr but I still have a degree of anhedonia and lack of satisfaction/pleasure in things. DPDR has lessened in intensity tho. All I feel now is a thin layer of it. Hopefully going up more takes care of it. Although it may not work, it’s worth a try if SSRI’s don’t do it for you. It saved my life, it may save yours too. Good luck :)",adrianlopeez11
1,Effexor XR,Generalized Anxiety Disorder,8.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"March 8, 2022",1,"Effexor helped with my anxiety but gave me bad insomnia. Looking back, I should have just dealt with the insomnia. Instead, I kept asking for other meds to help with ""this"" side effect and ""that"" side effect, all the while increasing my effexor dose. Eventually I started feeling manic and bulletproof. I almost lost my job for being belligerent. BUT I was also drinking alcohol. I started hearing whooshing noises when I turned my head too fast. I eventually moved on from effexor but I'm not 100% sure why.I just started back taking effexor after about 10 years. No alcohol. Cutting back on caffeine and will try to manage my sleep with good habits instead of pills. Starting at 37.5. Here we go.",Jason
2,Effexor XR,Generalized Anxiety Disorder,9.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"February 12, 2022",1,"Effexor XR stopped my suffering. Before Effexor, I was struggling with depression, anxiety/panic, dissociation, etc. On 225 mg, depression is gone, panic is mostly gone, still get anxiety occasionally but it’s not even close to how it used to be and dissociation is not as intense as it once was. This medication lowered the intensity of my anxiety dramatically. It’s honestly a miracle. Thank god for this medicine. If SSRI’s aren’t a good fit, try Effexor.",adrianlopeez11
3,Effexor XR,Generalized Anxiety Disorder,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"January 28, 2022",1,"I’m 28, I’ve struggled for 13 years with crippling anxiety. I first tried celexa years ago and that made me a zombie which scared me away and into dealing with my anxiety on my own. I’ve coped well with it. I recently had a lot of life changes which made me really anxious about everything and then depression came on top of that being a single mom. Anyways. Few months ago I decided to give it a try. I was prescribed with cipralex and it seemed to help my depression right away but made my anxiety way worse and was always fatigued no matter what time I took it. Was on that for 3 months. Finally I had enough and my doctor switched me to Effexor XR. Honestly the first day was instant relief!!! No more anxiety and all around feeling good with lots of energy. This was a huge life saver for me. It’s only been 2 weeks on it now and I don’t even want to look back, just forward in life. I can’t believe I’ve suffered so long thinking that it was normal to feel like that.",Sab19462
4,Effexor XR,Generalized Anxiety Disorder,9.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"January 27, 2022",0,"I am taking Effexor XR, along with 5 other drugs for my mental health. I am diagnosed with Bipolar I disorder (with severe depression), OCD, GAD, C-PTSD, Borderline Personality disorder, ADHD... anyways, this is definitely helping with my intrusive thoughts and depression and anxiety. My ONLY complaint is that the first few days on it, I had just come out of the hospital, and I was feeling more manic than normal. Fortunately, with my other drugs (plus some melatonin for sleep), I was able to stabilize, making Effexor XR worth it I think. I'm still relatively new to it (a few weeks) and on a low dose (although that might be for the best with the mania risks) but I certainly see a difference now. I think patience is required!(note: I also take Zyprexa, Depakote ER, Requip [that's for Restless Leg Syndrome], Concerta, and Clonidine... it's taken me 7 years of many trials to find a good balance... who knows if it'll last, but I'm hopeful.

5,Effexor XR,Generalized Anxiety Disorder,10.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"December 30, 2021",10,"I have suffered from a severe anxiety since childhood and have been a regular user of benzodiazepines such as Ativan.  In 2004 I suffered major depression  in addition to anxiety which is always present and was prescribed Effexor. It really helped me and enabled me to think, and  feel better and go back to work. It made me more confident and assertive, and no longer did I have obsessive - worrying thoughts. Since then I tried different medications for anxiety/depression, but all had horrible side effects so I could not continue taking them. I am back on Effexor - 75 mg works beautifully for me and I no longer worry, my anxiety is gone. It feels so good to feel happy and be able to live in peace without the continuous inner torment. Effexor is the only drug that works for me!",Vanessa
6,Effexor XR,Generalized Anxiety Disorder,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"December 28, 2021",1,"This medication did not work out well for me. I understand that these types of medications can affect people differently, but I wanted to share my experience. I took this medication for anxiety at 37.5mg for 2 days and that was enough for me. The first day was fine, the second day I felt depersonalization and like what was happening around me was not real. That night I went to bed at 10pm and woke up 2 hours later having racing thoughts and hallucinations and hot flashes and nausea. My heart was racing, I had a burning in my chest that radiated up to my underarms and my body was shaking and sweating profusely. This was followed by chills and then repeat of the same scenario with the hot flashes and racing thoughts/hallucinations. I thought I had been given LSD by mistake! I decided to stop taking the medication. Luckily I did not have any withdrawal or negative side effects - only a minor headache.",aspenwoods
7,Effexor XR,Generalized Anxiety Disorder,8.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"September 22, 2021",3,"CW: Mention of being suicidal. I suffer from borderline personality disorder and PTSD. Personality disorders are wild because you don't know how much of you is really you and how much is just symptoms of it. This medication changed my entire life. I have goals, dreams, passions, a sense of identity, a drive to better myself, a healthy and nurturing relationship, all of which I would not have dreamt of having before. This medication is the best thing that happened to me, because before I used  it I was just drifting through life waiting to die and every day I hoped would be my last and waking up each morning felt like a punishment. The reason I didn't give it the 10/10 it probably deserves is because the initial couple of weeks of treatment are awful and it definitely gets worse before it gets better, and also the withdrawals. I don't always have the means to get my prescription, and by the second day without taking it I feel like death. Drunk without the fun lol",BBx

I was also diagnosed with glaucoma which interacts with antidepressants because these medications can raise eye pressure so my G.P tried me on effexor just through desperation due to my suicidal tendencies/thoughts. I didn't think it was humanly possible to feel worse than I could but effexor certainly did that. This is the worst of all the antidepressants it's like hippie crack and angel dust combine. Within 3 hours I was on the toilet then constantly sweating actually dripping in sweat then the monster panic attacks and brain zaps kicked in. First three days I didn't eat a single thing by day 7 I was wanting to get sectioned.

9,Effexor XR,Generalized Anxiety Disorder,9.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"August 17, 2021",177,"This medicine works. With side effects, yes. But IT WORKS. Tips: Start with 37.5 mg every morning for 7 days. Then replace 37.5 with 75mg every morning for another 7 days. At the end of the 2nd week you will start to feel 'human' again. Add another 37.5 every afternoon for another 7 days,  but not too late in order to avoid insomnia. At the end of the month replace the 37.5 with 75 mg and so you have 150 mg every day with minimum side effects. Anxiety will reduce, sentimental reactions will become more curbed and manageable. You will be yourself again. Remember: be patient and persistent. Stick with it, especially the first month, don't give up. Use some diazepams in order to reduce the anxiety produced by the pill the first weeks! Feel free to ask anything! United we stand!!!",Lalakis
10,Effexor XR,Generalized Anxiety Disorder,2.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"July 17, 2021",2,"I was on this medicine from July 2010 until December 2013. When I started taking it, it made me feel like a zombie. I thought I was also going crazy. It made me gain around 40-80 pounds, if not more. It made me depressed and even more anxious. I would not leave the house and sometimes would not shower for days. I decided that in June 2013 that I was going to wean off the medicine. I was weaning off of it for about 5-6 months. While weaning off of it, I still didn’t want to do anything and was falling classes in college. Once I got off it fully, which was December 2013, I started to experience extreme anxiety. What helped me was being distracted, seeing a therapist, exercising and being on a keto diet. I didn’t feel like myself until September 2014, so it took a while. I absolutely would never go back on this medication",Jimmy_Cash1992

Began to help in some ways almost immediately. Slowly, I've tapered my dose down from 150mg to just 37.5mg (gone up and down some in between through the years). This small amount still makes a significant difference in my anxiety and has caused a big improvement in my overall outlook on life. It is an extremely difficult drug to taper off of. As someone who works in medicine, I wish they would educate healthcare professionals about how crazy the withdrawal can be from drugs like this.",Alice

I’ve been trying to get off of this drug for 4 months and I can’t because of the awful withdrawal symptoms. I remember reading that I will probably have to open the capsule and taper down on the little beads inside to wean off of this awfulness.

14,Effexor XR,Generalized Anxiety Disorder,7.0,,"May 30, 2021",7,"I took 75-112.5mg of Effexor for depression and anxiety for the first time in 2016 and felt overall more energy, more cravings for food and lower anxiety/depression levels overall. I did have sleeping issues which made me more irritable. I got off Effexor and changed to Prozac, little energy, super lazy, weight gain etc so went back on in 2019.  Worked my way up to 150mg as I had a lot of intrusive thoughts and intense anxiety, At 150mg- hard time sleeping.  you don't take the drug regularly, you WILL feel it so you must be anal about taking it every single day around the same time ( took in morning) I experienced 30-40lbs weight gain in 2 years + covid weight but the meds made me gain more weight cause of the cravings and increased appetite at 150mg. I will say, if weight gain is not an issue for you and you can commit to taking the drug regularly, 75-112.5 mg is a perfect sweet spot and the drug really does help. I recommend for anyone facing GAD or depression even OCD.",zenalee

I started with lexapro and it made me feel terrible, with horribly low libido. I then tried Busbar with the same side effects. Effexor XR was my next try. I’m writing this because I was nervous about taking this medication after reading reviews. This medication has saved my life. I can finally do things that anxiety stopped me from doing. My panic attacks have decreased to hardly any. I had social anxiety and I feel like I can have a normal conversation without stuttering due to being anxious. The only con I have of this medication is if I skip it one day I have horrible flu like symptoms, extreme headaches. However, I don’t plan to skip it regularly so as long as you take it as prescribed this shouldn’t be a problem. I 10/10 recommend this medication!",Addie

Effexor was the only medication that continued to work at 225mg for 16 yrs until I decided I’d had enough of taking pills and got off them in a week with hardly any side effects at all. I did notice when trying to find the right dosage for me at 150mg I felt my mind become numb. I had no empathy, emotions and felt like a zombie but increasing the dose took me out of the fog and I could function like a normal human being.

Effexor was so much easier to start for me, with very few side effects (mild headache, some shakiness, some mild chest tightness). I started at 37.5 mg then bumped up to 75 mg. Once I went to 75 mg, something just clicked and so much fogginess went away. My anxiety improved and my mood is much more stable. This is definitely a much better drug for my chemistry. That being said, don’t be afraid to try it, and don’t take the negative reviews to heart, people are much more likely to leave negative reviews for bad experiences.

21,Effexor XR,Generalized Anxiety Disorder,7.0,,"September 24, 2020",47,"Was prescribed Effexor 37.5 MG for GAD and Depression. I also Have OCD.  Side Effects were as follows;1st Day: Fuzzy, Lethargic, Unable to focus, Stomach Issues.2nd Day: Same as First Day with Loss of Appetite. 3rd Day: Same as Second Day4th /5th Day: Same as Previous Days, except SLIGHTY raised Anxiety and Notably raised Depression.6th Day: Felt Better, Slept Better, Appetite Still Down.7th Day: Noticeably Less  Anxiety and Depression, No Libido  which in my case is good b/c I have a tendency to have lots of unprotected sex with random women.8th day: Appetite is still not right, but I feel better than I did before I took the meds, and definitely better than I did in the first 5 days of taking it. For some it takes longer but if you are a person with bad anxiety, any physical ailments seem worse than they really are. I'd say the first 7 Days on 37.5 MG are tough, but it eventually got better.

22,Effexor XR,Generalized Anxiety Disorder,10.0,,"September 20, 2020",139,"I have always been a more anxious person, but in college I experienced sensations of extreme anxiety (detached from reality drenched sweating shaking) and almost passed out. This lasted for days I went to the ER and was told it was a result of extreme stress and was given an Ativan. This continued for a year anytime I felt mildly stressed and went to the doctor. I had a horrible reaction to celexa it sedated me, Zoloft helped some but not great, and Effexor. Effexor was difficult at first was fatigued and dizzy for about 2 weeks. In the fourth week the good effects of the medication hit me and it felt like I could breathe again. I am an even better version of myself by that I mean happier and calmer. I don’t experience the physical symptoms on a daily basis. I’m more confident and worry less about stressful situation. It took me trying 3 different meds to feel this way.

26,Effexor XR,Generalized Anxiety Disorder,5.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"July 30, 2020",25,"Took Effexor XR for 3 years for Generalized Anxiety Disorder , started at 150mg and ended up on the lowest dose available after 3 years. Pros: was finally able to go places, work, make friends. It was hard to actually have a panic attack which was great. I was able to function! Combined with psychotherapy it got me to a good place mentally. Cons: weaning off Effexor was a month of real awfulness. Withdrawal was horrific, felt like I had tentacles inside my brain, migraines, extreme sensitivity to sound/light, even when changing dosages I would experience withdrawal and sleep paralysis. Emotionally it made me feel like a zombie, no longer feel anything above a ‘grey’ daily baseline, relationships suffered, I had zero libido or joy. The biggest thing - it’s permanently affected my memory. I struggle to remember things from those 3 years and on it I struggled a lot with brain fog, losing my train of thought and not being able to retain information. It makes me sad that I’ve lost memories of travel and milestones.",ED
27,Effexor XR,Generalized Anxiety Disorder,10.0,Taken for 10 years or more,"July 18, 2020",122,"Just a friendly PSA:I understand everyone reacts differently to medications, but I feel that Effexor XR is getting an undeserved bad rap. I took a75 mg for 6 months, then down to 37.5 for generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) I stayed on the lowest dose for over 10 years. I never looked back. I felt great every day. Tamping down all the anxiety is a HUGE game changer. Anyhow, when I tapered off, I did it EXTREMELY slowly under my docs supervision. It took almost 10 months, but I NEVER had any withdrawal symptoms.... ever. The key here is to not be in a hurry. And honestly... I had some pretty uncomfortable side effects for about 6 weeks when I first started, but nothing compared to the crippling anxiety. Don’t be afraid of it, at least trying this drug if your doctor prescribes it for you. Just give yourself 6-12 full weeks for any relief, and if its not a good fit, don’t fear tapering off SLOWLY......",Catwoman22
28,Effexor XR,Generalized Anxiety Disorder,9.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"July 3, 2020",44,"I ended up in the emergency room for what I thought was a heart attack. After an extensive workup, it turns out I had just experienced my first major panic episode. I’ve always had anxiety, but it never got so bad that I thought I was legitimately dying. After speaking to my psychiatrist, he recommended starting me on Effexor XR. Within a month, I noticed a change in my ability to handle stressful situations and everyday generalized anxiety I battle with. It has boosted my confidence immensely. The only downside is that if I miss a dose or am late taking it, I have bad detoxing side effects. I would describe it as feeling drunk - disoriented, almost to the point of being uncomfortable to drive. If you are the type to be on top of taking your meds, I think this medication is worth a try.",Macy
29,Effexor XR,Generalized Anxiety Disorder,8.0,,"April 11, 2020",25,"The people saying they don’t get side effects maybe they just don’t notice, but there are side effects. I sweat more, sleep less, and have no sex drive, but those are all things I can live with in exchange for the positive effects I get. I started taking Effexor in high school because I was sleeping an average of 16 hours a day, likely had depression because I was anxious so much, and my quality of life was abysmal. I left the house like four or five times a week at the most as a 16 year old. Once I started Effexor I started to feel more energized, I didn’t need nearly as much sleep, and my depression has cleared away completely. I still have issues with anxiety attacks, but have recently lowered my Effexor dose and started taking lexapro as well. This is a medication you cannot miss doses on because you will start to feel serious symptoms of withdrawal if doses are skipped, but it’s a great medication worth trying if you haven’t found what’s worked for you yet.",Anonymous

I’ve been clean for 4 years. I’ve struggled with depression & anxiety my whole life. I just finished the Hep C treatment. Now I have random rapid heart palpitations. Also I just had a baby, a c-section, 2 blood transfusions, & gallbladder surgery so it was probably a combination of things that messed up my natural balance. I’m terrified and excited all at once about it. I hope it works for me. Seems like it just depends on the person really? Like any medicine really. But I’m terrified about the withdrawals. I’ve had my fair share of horrific withdrawals. it’s one of the main reasons I quit heroin & why I won’t go back. So it’s my first day on it & I did what someone else suggested & I took out all the granules (75mg caps) & only took 30 granules. So I will check back in in a week or 2.

I have had horrible issues with my sleep, with my diet and my stomach always hurting and being in knots 24-7. When I started Effexor everything changed for the better.

I only take a dose of 37.5mg. I would like to increase it one day. The only side effect that I would say is why I rate this a 9 is it has caused some sexual issues but not as bad as SSRI's did to me. It is true once on it your hooked forever. But that is 100% fine with me. I am more social and excited about life knowing each day I will never have to feel the knots and pain in my stomach, horrible anxiety ever again. THANK YOU to whoever made this medication.

I am already on Lamotrigine ( 75mg) for my bipolar disorder, and that helped. Recently Effexor XR was added to my regimen (37.5mg) for depression and also anxiety as well. Then I take GABAPENTIN 300mg as needed for mood and anxiety relief ( kinda acts like a benzo but isn’t a benzo). I’m also tapering off Lorazepam from my usual dose of .5mg to now .25, then probably nothing.  But when Effexor was added immediately I felt my mood lift like within 2 hours after taking first pill. So I thought maybe I was tweaking but usually I know if pills work or not on how I wake up the next morning. Woke up next morning and I felt close to normal again. So I know day by day it will just get better. I don’t even take it with food but haven’t noticed any side effects yet. Nothing. Just ease.

Was on 37.5mg (starting dose) total of 25 days and developed what is believed to be a serotonin syndrome.  Reading up on it, because I’m also on Gabapentin and a benzodiazepine, the combination with EffexorXR is  potentiator for serotonin syndrome (even at 37.5mg) AND discontinuation syndrome (damned if you start, damned if you stop).  Am incapacitated by severe ongoing vertigo.  Wish I had never let the very experienced psychiatrist get me in this situation.  Wouldn’t touch this drug with a 10 ft pole.",Sky C.

Starting the medicine my BP was normal I just had bad anxiety and at times panic attacks. I thought all was well and didn't think much of it, but each time I went to see the Dr. My BP would raise just slightly higher each visit. My wife told me I wasn't acting myself so I decided to make an appointment and my BP had gone from normal to 175/130. The Dr. Immediately cut my dose to 75mg a day which had brought it down to 140s over 90s. This medicine can make some peoples BP go through the roof, and when you stop taking it the withdrawal effects are terrible. When your coming off Effexor your BP can also run severely high along with dizziness, muscle/joint aches&pains, some chest discomfort, headache and possibly brain zaps. While Effexor does work good for a lot of people it did nothing for me except give me high blood pressure and nearly put me in the hospital. Always monitor or BP on this med.

76,Effexor XR,Generalized Anxiety Disorder,9.0,,"May 15, 2017",50,"I started Effexor XR in Nov 2016. The first week (37.5 mg) was a bit of a roller coaster for me in terms of emotions. Every day around noon I would start to feel a bit panicky and get hot/cold flashes. After about 5 days the mood swings stopped. I had a brief period where I could feel there was a difference, and then it ""crashed"". I upped the dose, and the same pattern repeated every 3-4 weeks, where the meds would become effective, crash, increase the dose, and repeat. After roughly 6 months of this, I have finally made it to a dosage that didn't crash (187.5 mg). I am SO grateful for this - the benefits were well worth the wait. Doing things/talking to people no longer makes me feel completely exhausted. Have patience with this drug.",Rii
