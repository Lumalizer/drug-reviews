0,Lexapro,Generalized Anxiety Disorder,10.0,Taken for 10 years or more,"March 16, 2022",16,"I begin taking this drug 10 years ago when I thought I was seriously ill. I had numerous medical tests done, but in the end my doctor was right and it was just anxiety and panic attacks. I don’t say JUST lightly. I know you are reading this post because you are miserable with suffering, and struggling so much right now. Please know that you are in good company, and so many people are suffering just as you are. I highly encourage you to give this medication a solid chance. I’m not gonna lie, the first 2 to 3 weeks were pretty brutal. Increased anxiety at times, then better at times. Then one day, I had an entire afternoon where  I felt perfectly normal. The next day I had a little anxiety, but those good days grew longer and longer until I realized I wasn’t constantly keeping score about my anxiety. Back and forth for a while, just like the tide. My ideal dose is 20 mg, but I usually take 10 when things are relatively calm; 20 when things get really bad. YOU’VE GOT THIS! Hugs",Tried and True
1,Lexapro,Generalized Anxiety Disorder,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"March 16, 2022",7,I have suffered with anxiety for most of my life I am now 29. I stopped driving and going places alone because I would have such severe panic attacks  I tried Prozac in the past but felt it wasn’t for me. I am on day 3 of 10mg lexapro at night. The first night and next day was  a complete nightmare DO NOT STOP TAKING IT! Do not get discouraged. I feel much better day 3 other than my appetite has not returned just yet. I am calm and I am more patient I am not on edge wanting to fight or flight! I am still out of work because I am adjusting to the lexapro and want to be able to start eating more to gain my strength. I will leave another review in a month to let y’all know how it’s going. Sending lots of love! We got this! And we can get our lives back!,leelou92
2,Lexapro,Generalized Anxiety Disorder,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"March 11, 2022",1,"Hi, my experience was very awful and bad. My doctor gave me lexapro 10mg I only took it for 3 days.

3,Lexapro,Generalized Anxiety Disorder,9.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"March 9, 2022",9,"I have never experienced this much peace.  I am 38 years old and have struggled with anxiety my whole life… the craziest part is that I have just pushed through it all these years.  I have been very successful In Business and in life, but I have never been at peace with myself or my surroundings.  I am on day 9 of lexapro 10mg and I feel like a different person.  After 2 years of anxiety that wouldn’t allow me to sleep, panic attacks, and anxiety related depression…. Enough was enough.  If you’re struggling with GAD give this a try.  It might just save your life like it has saved mine.  The first week was brutal.  I was crawling out of my skin, terrible dreams, sweating, couldn’t get our bed for 2 days… but 9 days in and I am in a mental place that I never thought possible.  Trust me, you don’t deserve to live with anxiety and fear like most of us here do.  Seek help, you will find peace you deserve",CHI
4,Lexapro,Generalized Anxiety Disorder,7.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"March 7, 2022",0,I started with Lexapro  5mg since I am very sensitive to medication just to start there. I took it for two days along with wellbutrin 150mg xl that I have been taking for like 6 months and although it made my anxiety dissipate it also shorten my emotional span. It didn't blunt me but I felt more mellow. BUT it gave me a terrible cerebral feeling like if my brain was fried. Couldn't continue cause this feeling made me feel like dying. Not suicidal but it sucked. But if you can push through that then you may reap the benefits.,Nat
5,Lexapro,Generalized Anxiety Disorder,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"March 5, 2022",4,"This pill saved my life, there’s no doubt in my mind. I was experiencing daily, intense anxiety and panic, my latest episode left me so shaken and traumatized, I immediately scheduled an appointment with my doctor to talk about medication options. I won’t lie, the first week was very tough. Heightened anxiety, shaky, no appetite, both fatigue and insomnia. I almost gave up by day 3. With the help of my support system, I stuck it out, and saw noticeable changes in my behavior by week two. My appetite was coming back, I was able to sleep, and my anxiety episodes never progressed to the point of hysteria. By weeks three and four, I felt hopeful about the future again. The mornings and evenings were still a bit nerve filled, but during the day I could function, and I had my motivation back. In entering week five, and I haven’t had more than a slight stomach ache in the morning when I first wake up. I keep wondering, is this how normal people feel every day?.",euphoricjess
6,Lexapro,Generalized Anxiety Disorder,10.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"March 5, 2022",1,"Wow!!! It took over 30 years to be diagnosed with the CORRECT medical condition. I've tried countless Prescriptions, therapies, you name it! Lexapro has been a REAL lifesaver. I've been taking the 20mg pill for 6 months now. I no longer have road rage and petty things that used to drive me batty no longer do. Guys!! That alone speaks volumes! I thoroughly enjoy not getting irritated over petty crap. I lost two of the closest people in my life a few months apart last year, and instead of losing my mind, I cried here and there, but that was it!! Definitely a much more pleasant person to be around.

8,Lexapro,Generalized Anxiety Disorder,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"February 25, 2022",1,"I was taking the drug for anxiety and depression. I'd rate both as moderate. After two doses of 10mg I woke up on the third day with side effects much worse than the original problem. The main effect is an intense whole body distress that goes in waves. I could do nothing but curl up and moan. The rest of the day was spent staring off into space.  The second major effect was to turn my mild tinnitus into a scream. There are other side effects that I will not note but are not as bad as these two. Overall the worst drug I have ever taken by a huge margin.I stopped after the first two pills and am still waiting for the side effects to go away. It's been eight days now and thing are better but I am hoping to get back to the original anxiety/depression.Fifteen years ago I had a bad reaction to another SSRI so I have learned one useful lesson, don't ever take this class of drug again",Bad Stuff
9,Lexapro,Generalized Anxiety Disorder,10.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"February 22, 2022",10,I have always had generalized anxiety my whole life which limited me to not being able to enjoy life like I should be. I decided to try Lexapro out and WOW I wish I did sooner. I was scared to start taking this medication  due to the side effects I read about. I started with 2.5mg for the first 2 weeks then up to 5mg then finally up to the perfect dose for me of 10mg.

11,Lexapro,Generalized Anxiety Disorder,,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"February 19, 2022",5,"This is a miracle medication for me.  I am in my mid-40s and I have a biological kind of anxiety and depression.  I've been seeing a psychologist for 5 years and have a lot of useful coping techniques that I thought would see me through if I ever came off medication.  I came off Zoloft very slowly after being on it for > 5 years.  At first I was fine but then my anxiety crept back in and hit with a vengeance.  I had dreadful insomnia and my anxiety and depression were off the charts.  Nothing in my life had changed.  I literally woke up one day with a cloud hanging over me that just got worse and worse. No amount of diet, exercise, meditation or CBT did a thing.   I tried all of the non-serotonin antidepressants like Bupropion and Agomelatine and they did nothing.   Four weeks into taking Lexapro, my anxiety and depression had completely resolved.  I am happily married, have 2 wonderful children and a great career that I can now enjoy.  I will happily stay on this medication forever.",FeelingBetter
12,Lexapro,Generalized Anxiety Disorder,9.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"February 11, 2022",0,"Leaxapro helped me a lot, I was at first scared to take any medications. (I also have ADHD). My doctor also diagnosed me with GAD, so ADHD and GAD were not a good mix. Took 26 years for me to get help. Started at 5mg, it worked great for 7 months, then in January I noticed I was starting to get anxious about small things in my life, mostly surrounding my pet birds. Doctor monitored me, and decided to up my dose to 10 mg, it's my 9th day and I'm feeling okay. Mild side effects like being sleepy, stomach problems and headaches.  Since starting I've been able to come out of my shell and not build walls up around myself to keep people out, it's made me more confident and I can enjoy things stress free now.",indyrae

I find comfort in my bed and afraid if I leave the house I'm going to have a panic attack which just increases my anxiety. I'm still taking 5mg at night and reading the reviews are helping me stick with it. I'm trusting the process and can wait to get my life back. When should I feel a relief.",Nene
14,Lexapro,Generalized Anxiety Disorder,2.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"January 13, 2022",1,"My doctor switched me over to Lexapro after my 20mg of paxil stopped working after about 20 years.  I was excited to take it cause I thought that it would work the way paxil did when I first started taking it.  Unfortunately that ended up not being the case.  At 30mg of lexapro I felt some improvement and so my doctor put me on 40mg.  That worked better for a while but not 100 percent.  After about 4 months on 40mg I realized that things were not going to get better, and so I was taken off lexapro.",Cookie
15,Lexapro,Generalized Anxiety Disorder,10.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"January 8, 2022",1,"Lexapro gave me my life back! I was struggling with GAD for some months and tried other medications before my psychiatrist prescribed Lexapro. I was dealing with panic attacks everyday and literally didn’t know what to do with my life anymore. The first day I felt a difference, it was like a breath of fresh air. The next couple weeks I still had some off days but by the end of week 4 I was able to live regularly again. If you’re just starting Lexapro just remember it’s not a miracle drug. It takes time. Give it 4-6 weeks and try not to give up while waiting to see results. I still suffer from panic attacks and anxiety but it is so much easier to bear. Don’t let all of the negative reviews scare you.

16,Lexapro,Generalized Anxiety Disorder,10.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"November 24, 2021",8,"Let me start that it takes quite some time for the meds to kick in . First 4 weeks were brutal for me . Between constant fear and anxiety and non stop crying and lost of appetite I thought I am going crazy, but after 4 weeks things got better a bit.  Less tired,  less tears.  Week 6 was very good and hopeful. My energy levels were higher,  started to smile again . Less naps during the day ( I could sleep 14 hours and that wasn't enough in my first 4 weeks) I am on week 8 , my anxiety is manageable.  Still there but less scary . Therapy helps too . Lost 20 lbs within 7 weeks , not feeling hungry but energy levels are much much better. So please give this medicine a try . It might not work right away and changes might not be noticeable right away but over time you will see the difference.  I started on 2.5 mg then bumped it to 5 mg and now I am on 7.5 mg.

18,Lexapro,Generalized Anxiety Disorder,10.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"November 9, 2021",8,"I’m I was diagnosed with generalized anxiety disorder at age 11. I had been on paroxetine up until the age 18, when it stopped working, apparently because I was on it too long. For over 2 years I was struggling to find the right medication. It was hurting my mental health to constantly switch medications and go through the trial and error process. Prozac, Zoloft, Lamictal… You name it. Lexapro saved me and helped me become a functioning member of society again. I no longer suffer from panic attacks or have a horrible pit in my stomach whenever I go into a situation that would’ve made me pass out. Side effects were minimal to none. A headache and stomachache here and there, but other than that, I was seeing results within 2 weeks. After it was in my system I have absolutely no side effects. Miracle drug for me.",Carmen
19,Lexapro,Generalized Anxiety Disorder,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"November 4, 2021",3,"Stick with it is the best advise I was given.  I was started on 20mg 3 weeks ago and the side effects and changes were difficult and I missed a couple days of work. (Mine were/are  tiredness, dizziness, no sex drive, nausea, diarrhea-1st week only, constant yawning) but this week I feel amazing!   I had quite a bit going on as you can tell by the high dose. I still have some of my anxieties and spurts of depression but I haven't been on it very long. It has really taken the edge off and helped me feel calm.  I felt like I was at my breaking point. Seeing a Doctor was the best thing I did. Feeling like I did was no way to live and I did for many years.  I started out taking lexapro in the mornings, but the pharmacy called and said I should try at night. But I may switch back to mornings because I cant fall asleep now.  Overall it was worth the wait and the side effects  I'm feeling much better than I did.",Lubean
20,Lexapro,Generalized Anxiety Disorder,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"November 2, 2021",11,"I felt it only fair to leave my review when I used these reviews to get me through. I was terrified of starting medication and more so by some bad reviews. I tried Zoloft & reacted really badly which solidified my views of not using meds. I tried every holistic approach & after 12 months of living with panic disorder I couldn’t live with it anymore, every day was exhausting and constantly living in fear of another attack. I’m only day 12 on lexapro, the first week is rough, my anxiety heightened and I had to have valium to help relax, it gets worse before better. Every day when I wondered if & when this drug would work I read the good reviews for encouragement & I promise the hard times pass. I have slowly felt better the past few days but today I feel amazing, I feel clear & I had a beautiful day at the beach with my family, I’m so excited for this new mind frame.

Three weeks on I feel like I am different person and like I can cope with life. Before this I had severe anxiety, some depression and hopelessness and obsessive compulsive thoughts and behaviours.  I feel very different and so much better. Please if you are struggling give this a chance as it could really help. I was scared too but very glad I tried it and its helped me even on a tiny dose. Side effects for the first week or so were fatigue but thats gone now. Only side effects now are a tense jaw and a slight twitching in my eye lid which has come and gone for a couple of days (although this could be due to stress and tiredness too).

My doc advised my body probably isn't absorbing the 100mg I was on, still having panic attacks rarely also. I am currently tapering off Zoloft to 50mg for 2 weeks, while taking 10mg of lexapro. It's only day one and I don't know if it was the reassurance from my doc (I had a lump in my hand near a vein and I convinced myself it was a blood clot after astra vaccination, doc thinks it's a ganglion cyst) that made me relax but I don't feel the need to overthink random muscle twitches to the point it becomes a panic attack. Only day 1 so not expecting every day to be jolly, but fingers crossed they are, update to come.

When at my absolute rock bottom, I would spend hours reading reviews begging & pleading for any semblance of hope during such a horrifically dark time.I was POSITIVE with every fiber of my being that it wouldn’t work for me & that I would be a shell of myself - anxious, panicky with doom dread & hopelessness forever. I was certain of it.The first 4 weeks were absolutely brutal. I held on by a thread as my body adjusted to the medication. I had morning dread, nausea, zero appetite, anxiety, hopelessness + more.I started feeling relief at 4 weeks almost exactly. I had to use lorazepam to sleep during this time and am weaning slowly off now, but at 8 weeks on Lexapro I feel 10000x better. I cope now. I get through the day with little to no anxiety, and little to no depression. It took around 6 weeks to get what I would say is relief & I am SO grateful. I am so much better now!!",Kma04

25,Lexapro,Generalized Anxiety Disorder,10.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"October 21, 2021",9,"I have been on and off Lexapro for 4 years. Every time I think I can stop and deal with life medication-free, I end up coming right back to Lexapro. I’ve tried other meds in the past, and I’ve determined that Lexapro is the one for me. I pair it with Bupropion and have such positive results. I have a bit more energy. I’ve been able to keep weight off. Mentally, wow. I feel so, so much better. I wake up feeling excited for the day. Things don’t bother me as much, and I can handle negative experiences in a calm way, and even get over them quickly. My anxiety is way lower, which is my favorite thing about this medication. Only downside for me is lower sex drive. It’s worth it to me to feel better and to enjoy life so much more. Unless you have adverse effects that you cannot function with, I recommend sticking with it. I felt better after just two weeks. But everyone is different. Hang in there. Things can and will turn around and get better. Love to you all.",CoffeeCats22
26,Lexapro,Generalized Anxiety Disorder,8.0,,"October 19, 2021",5,"I started off week one on a 5 mg dose just for an introduction not sure of what was going to happen. Week 2 and 3 I increased to the 10 mg. My anxiety seemed to get worse, I lost weight but stayed on Course. Week 4 my doctor increased to 20 mg. I experienced severe anxiety attacks, insomnia, trouble sleeping, night sweats. I have to admit it was awful, I thought I was dying. I stayed the course though after reading reviews and determined I have to give it time. It Took till week 7 to see a noticeable change. I am now on week 8 and am happy to say I have felt pretty much normal for a week and a half now. I highly recommend if trying this medication you give it at least 7 weeks to start working. I can’t imagine where I would be today without this med. I also recommend researching good foods for boosting Serotonin levels and change diet to suit.",Worry wart
27,Lexapro,Generalized Anxiety Disorder,9.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"October 11, 2021",11,"After reading these reviews myself I felt obligated to share my experience. I'm a 29 year old male that has had no anxiety issues up until a couple months ago. After speaking with my PCP he prescribed me with Lexapro which I think has saved my life. I definitely made a mistake at first and was taking it in the morning and quickly realized that wasn't the best idea and had a rough couple nights. After Day 3 and switching to taking it at night I realized that this is the most effective way to take the drug. On Day 10, I noticed that all of my physical symptoms were almost 95% suppressed and I was feeling a lot happier. If you have anxiety, give this drug a shot. I was once in your shoes reading these reviews before I took Lexapro and the anxiety you build from just reading the negative reviews can trigger more anxiety attacks. Give it a go and make sure you at least give it two weeks.",Richie B.
28,Lexapro,Generalized Anxiety Disorder,9.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"October 7, 2021",7,"Thank you to everyone who shared their experience!! I constantly read all of your stories and they filled me with hope. I had debilitating GAD and was afraid to do everyday tasks like cooking and driving. I was uncomfortable being alone and overwhelmed when anyone in my family wanted to hang out with me. I stopped talking to everyone and just stayed in my room. I was put on 5mg of Lexapro (generic) and my anxieties got worse. I was sweating a lot from my hands and feet, had racing thoughts about losing control, felt like I was never going to stop worrying. I had horrible insomnia and took melatonin nightly just to get a couple of hours of sleep a night. I began feeling better after 1 week at 5mg and increased to 10mg. I’ve been at 10mg for 5 days and on Lexapro for almost at 3 weeks total. I still have some insomnia and I have some brain fog but the fog usually lifts in the evening time.

I have struggled so much with white knuckling anxiety. Therapists told me to just ignore anxiety, but after almost passing out multiple times I couldn’t do it alone. Life with my level of anxiety was almost impossible. I shrunk into a barely recognizable version of myself. Back into a shell where I was safe and protected. Finally my doctor prescribed lexapro and it’s been so much easier. It’s not a magic pill but it turns the noise down 10-20% in all situations. I can handle 80% anxiety intensity with lexapro.

31,Lexapro,Generalized Anxiety Disorder,7.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"September 21, 2021",5,"Day 10. As others have said, the first few days were rough. The biggest issue I faced was constant hunger and maybe I gained a pound or two before I realized that much of the hunger pain can be satiated with water. My other mistake was taking it at 5pm made me drowsy as heck and feel kinda weird and hungry. Now I take it before bed and right on day 7, one week later, the hunger pain is gone.As for its effectiveness 10 days in? I think it might be too early to tell but I don't feel so worked up about going outside. In order to learn more I have to run more tests such as going to the store or simply pushing my own boundaries.I hope to remember to update this a few months from now.

32,Lexapro,Generalized Anxiety Disorder,10.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"September 6, 2021",14,"Having struggled with mild anxiety my entire life, this was always manageable until I reached my mid twenties, my mild anxiety started to become more severe. It had gotten to the point where I felt anxious nearly every waking hour, often for no reason. I could not find a way to control it. I would be nauseous, shaking, crying, sometimes even crossing over into depressive and dark episodes. I was sick of feeling this way and didn't see a way out. I decided to visit my doctor and was prescribed 10mg of Lexapro daily. I didn't experience any side effects apart from some fatigue and was beginning to feel better in a matter of days. Now, I barely feel anxiety at all. Sometimes I get a little nervous but it is fleeting and very easy to control. I feel happy, calm and capable of doing things before with ease that I couldn't have imagined. That little anxious voice in my head isn't there anymore. If you're considering this medication, definitely go for it. It made me feel like me again",DijonReo
33,Lexapro,Generalized Anxiety Disorder,10.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"September 5, 2021",12,"I have GAD. I have been anxious all my life. It has become a problem over the last 5 years or so as the symptoms became physical. I will hurt in random spots all the time; the top of my head, my joints, my muscles, my neck, my stomach, different random spots throughout my body. I have gone to doctors for these issues over the years to no avail. After some blood work or ultrasounds, they would say its stress and that would make me angry. They weren't taking me serious. I was offered SSRIs a few times and turned them down out of fear and denial. Fear that it would make me a zombie. Fear that without my anxiety i wouldnt be productive. Eventually I started seeing a therapist and she talked me into it. She said to try it and if it didn't help to stop. So I went for it. I started on 5 mg of Lexapro for about 2 months then to 10mg.

34,Lexapro,Generalized Anxiety Disorder,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"September 4, 2021",7,Just want to start by saying titrate upwards slow on this drug if you have a sensitive stomach. I thought starting at 20mg would be a good idea since I've been on it previously for a year. That was a mistake (I vomited 3 days in a row). Dr re-prescribed it at 5mg. I cut the 5mg in half and started 2 days on 2.5mg. I feel fine already 2 days into 2.5mg. I'm able to sit outside with my dogs without panicking.

I see that a lot of people on here don't understand that you have to give this drug time. It doesn't work within 1 week, it takes usually 4 to 6 weeks to start seeing the benefits of lexapro. But the benefits are absolutely worth the wait. If you just started taking lexapro, and it doesn't feel like it's working, like I said, just give it time. There's also mild side effects in the beginning stages of taking lexapro, but they do eventually go away, so don't worry about that.",Zack W

I first tried sertraline and that worked for me until I was 18 when I stopped taking it. Once my anxiety relapsed again a year later, sertraline didn’t work for me anymore. I then switched to Wellbutrin but that didn’t work for me after 6 months of waiting. I honestly thought I would never recover from my anxiety… until I tried lexapro!!! The very first week, I felt happier, I had more energy, I was talking more, I even told others that it felt like it was harder to be sad or to get stuck in that dark place when I’m anxious. Fast forward to 1 month on the drug, I haven’t even felt anxious for a moment. I feel like my old self!!! I have energy, I want to go out and do things, I just feel happy.

It’s an odd feeling because it’s something I’m not use to feeling.

I had always refused medication and relied solely on non-therapeutic management. VERY reluctantly I decided to try Lexapro because my mom (who has a very low tolerance of prescriptions) had a positive experience with this medication. I started on 10mg. I experienced a positive difference -- feeling ""more myself"" and less consumed by unwelcomed thought patterns -- was within a week, and very much so after being on the medication for 6 weeks. I didn't even realize how much of a difference Lexapro had made until I found myself finding JOY in life again. After being on the medication for about a year, I experienced difficult anxiety symptoms. My physician recommended I go to 20 mg daily. Again, I was very reluctant to increase, but did end up going up to 20. It's now been almost two years on 20mg/daily.

After 3 days, I went to 3.75mg. Again, nothing significant. 3 days later I started 5mg. The second day after starting the 5mg, I went to the salon. I ended up having two panic attacks before going inside. I felt sort of faint and not well. I was alone and 45 minutes away from home. I ended up canceling at appointment time, which I have never done and driving myself home. My Blood pressure which is usually normal was 150/94 while my pulse was only 62. At that point, I decided to stop the medication. I went back down to 2.5mg and stopped three days later. While some people have no issues, I was not one of them.

No side effects whatsoever. I began with drops of 2.mg and slowly reached one tablet of 10mg after 2 weeks.

70,Lexapro,Generalized Anxiety Disorder,9.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"April 6, 2021",42,Condition  GAD/DepressionMEDS  Lexapro 20mg / Lorazepam 3mg Klonopin 1mg I have had GAD most if my life. Only did a little good on prozac 10mg but moved to Japan where it is not approved. It took a couple of months to get to 10mgs and about a year to get on 20mg. After being able to tolerate 20mg everything became much better. Don't need the benzos as much and the only side effect is I feel a little spaced out.  I think you have to be patient with this med and give it plenty of time to change your brain before it starts to really work.  Compared to the various other meds. Lexapro had the least start-up side effects and they all went away pretty soon.  I truly believe that this medication is one of the best options but go slow. 5 to 10 to 15 to 20. After being on 10 for awhile going up isn't that bad. Good luck and always reach out to someone when it feels like you can't handle it.,mogy
71,Lexapro,Generalized Anxiety Disorder,9.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"March 24, 2021",6,"Started lexapro after relapsing with horrible anxiety. Needed to take about 20 mg after a few months. Unfortunately it did not work that good until the doctor coupled it with a 2mg dose of abilify and I started to notice a dramatic change. Now I'm down to a maintenance dose of 5mg of lexapro and 1mg of abilify to avoid another relapse. Be sure to talk to your doctor about how you feel every appointment or at least every few weeks. If you don't feel improvement it's very important to say so to find the right drug or mix. I was skeptical but luckily I found the right mix that brought me back to stability. And trust me, my anxiety was pretty terrible. Weight gain is little - but weight loss is a bit difficult to get going. It did take me a very long time to orgasm and did take a lot of the enjoyment out of sex but somewhat an after thought when you are scared straight. Give it a few months or even a year then talk to doctor about dropping the doses of needed.",DannyBoy

I was only treating it with Xanax prescribed by my PCP. My psychiatrist switched me from Xanax to 3mg klonopin. Then he started me on Lexapro 10mg, which I took for 5 weeks. The first couple weeks on 10mg made me feel increased anxiety, but did help me to sleep at night. It did not really help with general fear or anxiety so my psych increased to 20mg on week 5. This was helpful to a point but I still felt anxious every day, albeit less intense than before. After another 2 weeks with limited results, psychiatrist upped me to 30mg/day on Week 8. He says some people just require higher doses to get the same effect. I've been on 30 mg for a week (9 total weeks into Lexapro) and starting to feel MUCH better, like my old self.

I've been on it for 6 months. Since this is my first anti-depressant, I was started at 5mg and moved up to 10mg after two weeks. The first week was very tough. I woke up in the night with sweats and a racing heart. The first few days I felt a bit foggy/bit of a head high. I was forewarned that this was normal, so I persevered; I'm so glad I did! My day-to-day anxiety has been reduced tremendously. I can sleep through the night, I handle stress well, and I feel like I'm in control of my life. I'm excited to try new things and I'm more social. Before starting Lexapro, I had depression that felt like a fog - no energy, disinterested, plus frequent migraines. I haven't had any of those symptoms since going on the pill. When I'm in situations that trigger my PTSD I feel much more prepared to handle and get through the situation. This pill has saved my life.",Anne23

Sometimes I had to force myself out of bed because of a sense of dread I had no explanation for. I’m so happy I don’t have to live like that now. My only complaint is that it takes some extra effort to orgasm; that’s a small price to pay to enjoy life. If you’re scared like I was start at 2.5mg, if that feels okay up it 2.5mg each time.

I was able to get out of bed, shower, and live. It did have some side effects that I didn't enjoy. Namely, my libido zeroed out, leaving me with no desire for intimacy. I also started to get migraines from time to time, as well as weird, often gruesome, dreams. It definitely helped me to be able to live my life while managing my anxiety, but in the end, my side effects outweighed the benefits.",Mik

I've been on this lexapro for more then 4 years in the past. Then last spring when I've been noticing I sometimes forgot my 5 mg dose I tapered down on the medicine. In the summer no real issues, but the winter came in hard and 1 bad trigger had me right back on the anxious side. I re-started to take 10 mg for 2 weeks and now 1 week at 15mg. First weeks I suffered increased anxiety, panic attacks and didn't see any hope. And then BAM, it starts working. I'm still not at the full benefits but I feel it kicked in. Now I'm  back to having interest in stuff, people etc. So I have 3 major advices.1. Please give the medicine time, it might be rough but when it starts working you gonna have the real benefits. 2. It's not a shame to take a little pill. People with high blood sugar levels do it too. 3. Don't see this medication as the only solution... See therapists , do some cardio, mindfullness.I pray for all you guys!",Positivist

I would wake up every morning at 6am with it seemed to be a empty stomach. I went to the ER twice in the first week. I felt like there was no end. My husband thought it was all in my head. By week 2 every side effect started to decrease day by day. I was able to get out of bed and clean my house. I felt like I was not confined anymore. Week 4 brand new me.

My background: I was in the military and grew up on a farm. I was raised to be tough and to deal with my problems head on myself.The whole anxiety thing I thought was for weak people. People with weak minds who just couldn't handle life. The funny thing with anxiety is it does not make sense. I was always an outgoing person up for anything at the drop of a dime.I started getting anxiety just talking to people and around my family. I would get these episodes of feeling like I was out of my body and spaced out. Not knowing how to respond or thinking the person I was talking to knew I was really anxious.Cipralex has saved me,Everlaid

After a couple of years of psychiatric help (no medicines at the time) I was able to live a complete free panic attack life for more than 13 years. Suddenly, after two important job transfers and a couple of personal set backs, the GAD returned along with severe panic attacks that led to the hospital a couple of times. Anxiety/Panic Attacks became so severe that I was simply not capable of performing my job nor having a social life and took a plane home thinking of quitting. Fortunately, I was convinced by my doctor to take Lexapro (10mg)... what a life changer. Positive effects began to kick in 3 to 4 weeks (activation symptoms did occur for 2 weeks).",Louis 45

507,Lexapro,Generalized Anxiety Disorder,8.0,,"April 22, 2009",40,"I was in bad shape for 5 and 1/2 years when I was prescribed Lexapro. Uncontrollable crying, going into fits, breaking things. Flying off the handle for no reason. Two weeks on Lexapro and I had everything under control until the day my doctor wouldn't refill my script until I went to see him. I didn't have time for a visit so I just did without it. On about the 3rd day I was feeling strange, off balance, light headed, kind of fuzzy. 4th day when I turned my head I felt like I was in an old time movie, click-click-click. I went to the doctor, told him I wasn't feeling well, he didn't tell me why I was feeling like that but to take my Lexapro and I would feel better.",driver85201
