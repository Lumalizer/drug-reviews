I’ve been on Paxil for 11 year now for anxiety and depression at the time. I recently tried weaning off it and had all the side effects everyone on here is talking about brain zaps, severe anxiety, bad depression. I didn’t really know that was part of the withdrawal process I just thought it was my depression. I was put back on it and ever since I was put back on it I feel small boned, joints feel small, I feel like my structure shrunk and feel sucked up. I went to see an endocrinologist please if anyone else has anything that can relate to this or help let me know.",Joe_6161

I still couldn't get in an MRI or have dental work without sedation, I also have eye injections. I saw a psychiatrist who took me off it too quickly developed tinnitus from the stress  and went onto sertraline  and I came within a whisker of ending my life.

I had constant anxiety for 3 years straight, it was the worst time in my life. This medication is a miracle! I had one panic attack in the first 6 months of taking it, but now, I haven’t had one in 2 years. Crazy! It also helped cure my agoraphobia. I thought I would never get better, but wow. Just keep trying, you will find the medication that is right for you.",Peach
3,Paxil,Generalized Anxiety Disorder,10.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"February 5, 2022",2,"I was diagnosed w high functioning GAD years ago. Most of the years I’ve been able to manage it with meditation, spiritual podcasts, and therapy. But in 2020 my anxiety took a turn for the worse. For over a year, almost 18 months, I felt absolutely miserable. My fight and flight was constantly on. I couldn’t sleep unless medicated. I started feeling very angry and could barely get off the couch at the end of a work day, because it took so much energy to keep my cool at work. I finally gave in and consulted a psychiatrist. She diagnosed me again with major anxiety disorder and also with moderate depression, even though I was not sad, but the anger I felt was a huge symptom. I started with Zoloft , but started to lose all my hair , had major jaw clenching, and also trouble sleeping. 8 weeks ago we changed to Paxil 20mg. I feel amazing. I no longer have daily panic attacks, rumination, intrusive thoughts, and get a full night sleep every night. am excelling at work. No side effects.",Lux

5,Paxil,Generalized Anxiety Disorder,2.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"January 12, 2022",0,"20mg daily. I took it for 4 months before changing to new meds. The first week (which I know is the most intense for all SSRIS) was just so hard. My jaw was shaking uncontrollably, I was extremely tiered and I would fall asleep almost anywhere, I had extreme anxiety and sweating. However, I spoke to my psychiatrist who told me to continue as the side effects would subside. So I kept on, and yes the side effects did subside but 4 months in I still felt extremely fatigue. I was a long distance runner and even going for a walk became a challenge for me. I would sleep 8/9 hours a night and still found it incredibly difficult to wake up and I'd need a 2 hour nap in the day (thankfully I work from home). It was difficult for me to socialise, put on clothes and other basic day to day tasks. My jaw was also still shaking and in 4 months I had gained weight (lack of movement I assume). I do believe the anxiety subsided, but the side effects themselves gave me anxiety, especially the fatigue.",Melissaamy

7,Paxil,Generalized Anxiety Disorder,9.0,Taken for 5 to 10 years,"October 28, 2021",3,"Paxil has been lifechanging for me dealing with my generalized anxiety disorder.  There was a point in time where I couldn't drive without getting a panic attack, after years on Paxil, I barely even think about it when I get in my car.  One thing that surprised me to learn is that Paxil is an antidepressant.  I always figured Paxil was essentially a depressant with the way that it treats anxiety symptoms.  Personally, for me, Paxil does nothing for my depression.  Given the choice of treating my anxiety or depression, it's a very easy decision.  My depression ranges from mild to average, makes it difficult to be interested in things, get out of bed in the morning, interact with friends, etc.  My anxiety makes it almost impossible to live a normal life.I would definitely be interested to know if there's something that can be paired with Paxil that doesn't affect its ability to treat anxiety but helps with depression.",TraceAbandon

9,Paxil,Generalized Anxiety Disorder,5.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"April 16, 2021",0,"Before I took Paxil, I never knew what a calm mind felt like! I always felt as though instead of me controlling my thoughts, my thoughts would control me. I couldn’t stand another day feeling this constant apprehension so, I started on 10 mg and I started to feel a difference in my anxiety around week 3-4. Although my symptoms had decreased, I experienced a whole lot of side effects. To name a few: anhedonia, indifference (apathy), emotional numbness, derealization, depersonalization, dry mouth, diarrhea, low sex drive, increased appetite, changes in taste, yawning, drowsiness, mild sore throat, etc. I increased from 10 mg to 20 mg in order to treat the anhedonia, it did relieve it to an extent but I then felt too apathetic. I went back down to 10 and eventually discontinued due to other lingering side effects. Although this medication did calm me down and reduce my anxiety, I’d recommend trying this medication as a last resort! Try Lexapro before trying this one.",AnxiousBoy123 (A.L.)
10,Paxil,Generalized Anxiety Disorder,6.0,Taken for 5 to 10 years,"February 24, 2021",5,I took this when I younger for extreme anxiety and it really gave me my life back and fairly quickly. I found the sexual side effects tolerable when I was younger but as I got older not. Getting off it was crazy I felt brain zaps and a feeling like I was dropping on an elevator. It took weeks before these feelings went away. My sex life was never the same although it did come back to near normal. Citalopram is better for me.,Anxs1

I suffer from SEVERE anxiety and depression. Lexapro had stopped working. I tried Zoloft which made me super irritable and didn’t seem to help any and then Buspar which sent my panic and anxiety through the roof. I was then put on a low dose of Paxil and it was horrible. (Severe stomach pains, vomiting, diarrhea, depersonalization, relentless brain zaps, mood swings,etc) I know the initial side effects will usually go away but it was too bad I couldn’t even handle it. Everyone’s body is different though! Some meds work well and some don’t! I’m currently on Cymbalta which usually gets a bad rap and it’s been amazing for me.

Each person is individual and will react to antidepressants in a different way.  I was on Paxil for 17 years and then I started to feel some major fatigue.  I went off Paxil and didn't have side effects.  I have also tried Zoloft (zombie effect), effexor 75mg (worked on depression and anxiety but caused apathy), Fluoxetine 40mg (caused SI and had to be readmitted to hospital to get off it.I am now starting Paxil again after a year off it.  This time around I have slowly increased from 20 to 30 to 40mg.  It is one month since starting again.  SI has gone.  Mood is 80 percent.  I still have some anxiety.  I take Melatonin 10mg and Seroquel 12.5 to help with insomnia which I have never had before.  I take 0.5 Risperidone in the morning to help with anxiety.

23,Paxil,Generalized Anxiety Disorder,1.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"April 9, 2019",16,"If you are handed a prescription for this, please do your research first. Unfortunately I started taking this as I was desperate to get my anxiety under control and my GP didn’t want to prescribe me Valium anymore so I thought why not. After one year of being on this I have gained almost 20kg. I eat well and move around a fair bit but the weight just keeps on coming. It did well for my social anxiety, that’s because I didn’t want to leave the house embarrassed with how much weight I had gained. Now I am weaning off from 40mg and am on 10mg with the hope to be off completely. Withdrawal symptoms are comparable to having the flu tenfold. Detached sense of reality and agitation that normally wouldn’t be there. Even the sound of someone coughing is making me angry. Heightened sensory disturbances and insomnia have also come along. Avoid if you can. There are better SSRI’s out there if you need some help. This stuff is awful.",KT

27,Paxil,Generalized Anxiety Disorder,,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"July 21, 2018",32,"I have been taking Paxil for about a year now and have to say several positive things about it. Although it can be a pain to remember to take it, everyone’s body is different and withdrawals are manageable. (And if they aren’t you can go into any emergency room and request a refill; in an emergency) . Paxil has given me confidence in myself. I feel you have to treat it like a vitamin,  thinking  that the pill will fix everything can make you a typical pessimist, however, effects are really noticeable around the 3-4 week period. My experience is a more stable mood, diminished social anxiety, and more energy. I began to see improvements in the threshold for my emotions. It would take me a lot longer to become upset or anxious about something. It is not as if the feeling is gone but you become less stimulated by your environment. Things that really were stressful and important to me became petty and easier to manage. I have taken Lexapro, Prozac, and Effexor and I think Paxil has been the best overall SSRI.",Ryandawg

Three years into continuous sobriety I began to feel like I was experiencing PMS all the time. I drank for most of my adult life approx . 30 yrs, thus I may have needed SSRI’s all along. Long story short I tried 10 mg of paroxatine or Paxil which made me feel like I had motion sickness a day or two then it went away. I used to obsess over stupid stuff and I felt anxious which effected my sleep. Within 2 weeks I mellowed out without becoming lethargic or tired. Basically it took me down a notch and I am much more patient and not obsessing. 2 1/2 yrs later I am doing great at 20 mg.. my quality of life is much better.

That was the worst experience ever, coming off paxil was the hardest thing ever, and I recommend when you come off it to taper down very slowly because it just was absolutely hell.

43,Paxil,Generalized Anxiety Disorder,6.0,,"November 28, 2015",25,"After a few intense months of panic and high anxiety, I finally was brave enough to try this medication. I have tried other SSRIs in the past, but usually found them very agitating at the ""normal"" doses, so I have learned to start and stay very low. After a month of insomnia I finally decided to give Paxil a try. I started at 2.5mg. The first few days were fine, I felt sleepy and a bit lazy, but at least that was better than high-strung panic. At about a week, I started to experience some small benefits, and some fairly harsh side effects (nausea, diarrhea, derealization, increased panic). At a month, much better and I was sleeping well again. However, getting off this medication after 5 months was really challenging and uncomfortable.",jillybean2

The first two weeks I was on 10mg, and I could feel a big change. My pupils would dilate huge, which I read was because my brain was finally being flooded with serotonin. I actually would relate the side effects I felt as similar to MDMA (I spent from 19-23 as an avid drug user..have been clean now for 4 years). I felt awesome, but it didn't last. Two weeks in, my doctor increased my dose to 20mg. Since the increase, the ""good feeling"" has kind of went away. I feel how I did before I started Paxil, PLUS it's hard to think clearly&feels like something is pressing on my chest at night. I have absolutely no sex drive and have lost more than 20lbs due to not eating. It's done nothing for my anxiety yet.",KayleighFGG

The only problems are if I miss a pill I get those nasty electric shock feelings, I feel like my emotions are almost a bit too subdued (can't cry, sometimes you got to pet or out) and lastly I have NO sex drive.

63,Paxil,Generalized Anxiety Disorder,10.0,,"October 9, 2012",51,Paxil was an absolute life changer for me 8 years before 'pooping out' last year. Alcohol abuse was almost certainly the cause of it's ineffectiveness & I have learned my lesson. Many negative reviews on the web describe the severe withdrawal symptoms. I count myself lucky that Paxil worked wonders for me WITHOUT any withdrawal periods. Not everyone experiences this withdrawal so if you're here reading experiences & worrying about possible future withdrawal don't assume it will happen to you. I am now on mirtazapine which is ok but I really miss the feel good 'boost' & confidence that Paxil gave me. I used to call this my 'serotonin high'.  I hope to find another SSRI that worked similar to Paxil for me. Zoloft & citalopram failed.,Anonymous
