0,Pregabalin,Generalized Anxiety Disorder,10.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"March 24, 2022",3,"Pregabalin is an excellent medication as long as it is taken as instructed. I’ve taken pregabalin for years and it really helps with anxiety and pain. I had a dependency issue with benzodiazepines which is now resolved (and I can never and will never take them again) and the pregabalin really really helped with the withdrawals from the benzodiazepines which were (and still are a bit) absolute nightmare that no one should have to endure. Believe me opiate and opioid withdrawals aren’t in the same league as benzodiazepines withdrawals but pregabalin is really helping me in many ways - it helps with depression, anxiety, mood. If it’s used in conjunction with an anti-depressant it works wonders. The trick is to never take more than prescribed once you’ve found the dosage that works - mine is 150mg morning and night. If you’ve got GAD, depression or both give it a try because it works.",Getting better

It barely reduces pain in my toes. And does absolutely nothing for anything else. Over last 2 weeks I have been suffering severe anxiety attacks that put me in the ER nearly daily. I live in constant pain and these attacks are brand new. Until 2 weeks ago they never put me in the ER.",Hellbilly4788
2,Pregabalin,Generalized Anxiety Disorder,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"March 10, 2022",7,"I've only been on pregabalin for two days and it's been miraculous, 100 mg 3 times a day and my anxiety has just vanished. It seems to take effect within 45 minutes and lasts for about six hours per dose. My anxiety was out of control despite 20 mg of escitalopram and 2400 mg of gabapentin per day. The anxiety was so bad my only choice was to drink to excess, which was so bad for me. As soon as I switched from gabapentin to pregabalin my anxiety was eliminated and I had no need or desire to drink. More people need to know about this!",ekarno
3,Pregabalin,Generalized Anxiety Disorder,1.0,,"December 30, 2021",2,"AWFUL MEDICINE!!! Was prescribed it for anxiety for autism & ADHD, to stop racing thoughts and insomnia caused by anxiety at night. Well, not only did this drug make everything worse, I didn’t sleep for almost 4 days, causing a massive psychotic episode. The awful restless legs, They were thrashing about the bed non stop to a point where I’d have to get up. The insomnia was awful too, lying in bed for 8 hours with not an ounce of sleep. Mind was racing away, ruminating on absolutely ridiculous things that weren’t even bothering me BEFORE I TOOK THIS AWFUL MEDICINE! I’m highly skeptical of all these rave reviews. Simple as.

4,Pregabalin,Generalized Anxiety Disorder,10.0,Taken for 10 years or more,"December 25, 2021",10,HiBeen on this drug for 10 years+ and I gotta say that’s it has a marvellous effect on me. I suffer GAD and child trauma. My anxiety hits me as soon as I wake so I hit it back with 150mgs which works whilst I’m drinking my tea etc. I then top it up midday with another 75mg and my day is just normal. I know all the talk of getting to the root cause etc etc but just to get relief from crippling anxiety. It’ll do for me!!!,Mike UK 64 year
5,Pregabalin,Generalized Anxiety Disorder,1.0,Taken for 5 to 10 years,"December 23, 2021",6,"My advice is never take Pregabalin/Lyrica and if you are on it, stop before it is too late, please. My Psych. prescribed it to me for G.A.D. Like many, at first, I thought it was a wonder drug, but tolerance quickly sets in, so doses keep needing to be increased, leaving me unable now to walk properly, to think, or to concentrate. It has so many severe side effects. PLEASE read up on them before starting or continuing. It is a very addictive drug, so extremely hard to come off, especially at higher doses. Tolerance/withdrawal effects are horrific.",Lyuba

It works for a short time  but doctor is not going to keep prescribing diazepam.

7,Pregabalin,Generalized Anxiety Disorder,6.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"December 6, 2021",2,On this for a year when my anxiety was at it's worse. It definitely helped but I had unwanted side effect of weight gain. I'm not sure if it was this drug but my appetite seemed insatiable and I just ate and ate. In a year I gained 3 stone. After looking into side effects and seeing others report similar I decided to try and come off it which I did. At the time it helped my anxiety - but I still have a question mark over if it added to my weight concerns.,Pick714
8,Pregabalin,Generalized Anxiety Disorder,10.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"November 25, 2021",33,"I think this is the first review I’ve ever left on anything! I’ve suffered with Anxiety for years and I’ve been on numerous medications which have never worked so I gave up. I then recently went through a very rocky time in my life which flared up my anxiety - I couldn’t eat, couldn’t sleep and I was struggling with general day to day tasks until I discovered pregabalin. I am honestly amazed by the effect it’s had on me. Within a few hours of taking 100mg my Anxiety had pretty much gone and my appetite was back more than ever. Personally, I stopped taking this daily and I now take as and when I feel necessary which my GP is ok with. Never have I known something so effecting for Anxiety - game changer.",Hanna

I suffer with anxiety and low mood linked to many years of alcohol and illicit drug abuse. Although I have not drunk alcohol for some years and do not take recreational drugs anymore I am left with permanent raised anxiety levels owing to damage done to my nervous system I should imagine,I use pregabalin on a PRN basis if I have a social occasion coming up or a particularly stressful day ahead. My dose is the maximum of 600mg. This makes me feel like the person I was in my late teens before I started to destroy myself with the substance misuse.I have learned the hard way with pregabalin though as when I first took I had heard it was this wonder drug with no comedown and if you take it once for most people that is true. However don't think you can take it every day especially at high levels without the risk of severe withdrawals if you decide to stop. I am talking a week's physical withdrawals.",HonestReviewer

I was so sleep deprived and woke feeling uptight and short tempered.  I  tried a few drugs that did not really help but 1 year ago I asked my doc to try and he let me. A few weeks later my attack’s became less frequent and I felt much more rested in the morning the other major difference was my irritable bowel problems disappeared after many years of cramps and running to the loo. I also did not get up to go to the loo in the night so often I believe it all was due to the nerve connection.

After 4-5 months I decided it wasn’t helping so when I accidentally lost it I didn’t get a refill. The withdrawals were horrendous. Chills, mild hallucinations, body aches, agitation and sweats went on for 36 hours and prevented me from sleeping at all.

Sleep much improved but a little groggy when waking. Days 5 to 10 less good. Very lethargic, general loss of sense of time, somewhat ‘down’ with moments of feeling good even a little ‘high’.

26,Pregabalin,Generalized Anxiety Disorder,8.0,Taken for 5 to 10 years,"June 4, 2021",8,"I first started taking Lyrica for back pain. This led me to be believe my back pain was psychosomatic. Lyrica helped in more ways. It calmed me down mentally. I feel more relaxed and level headed. I sleep through the night well. I find it non addictive. However the side effects prevent me from taking it often so I generally use it sporadically. I know I shouldn’t but I do. I feel really good the next day. In terms of physical pain management I also took it with Celebrex. Again I am relatively pain free these days so I own have the combination during flare ups. Side effects: I find if I don’t have early in the evening I struggle to wake in the morning. I also find if I take during the day (which I no longer do) I feel groggy and a little lethargic. Overall this drug is one of the best tools I have for pain and mental health. Other things that help me are Meditation, Exercise and Wim Hofs breathing exercises.",Andrew5671

Gradually dropping down to 100mg a day.   I now take as and when I feel a wobble coming on.  It has been a life changer for me.  It helps calm me down within a hour if anxiety gets bad.  My GP suggested using as and when I needed it and I have had no problem with that scenario.  I think my body is used to it.  I was originally put on antidepressants which sent me loopy. Then a psychiatrist suggested pregabalin.  It really helps with sleep and helps me switch off.    Getting off this tablet was no problem as it can be dropped in doses of 25mg.  I had no problems with it at all.  If you have a chance to take it please give it a go.  It works really quickly and can be a game changer.,Tempest1

Since Lexapro did not have a good sedative effect, this medication did its job - cooled down all emotions and I could more easily manage my life.Let’s not forget only this - this is not an AD, that in chemical way restores neurotransmissions in your brain, this is more symptomatic cure and once you need to stop it  - it all could come back. Therefore, while on this drug, be sure you use your time wisely - go to therapy and learn new ways of your daily life, as this is your goal, not drugs.

I stopped taking the medication about 3 weeks ago, and whilst processing traumatic memories recently my anxiety became bad (nowhere close to what it was though) and my emotions quite dysregulated (again, never as bad as before)So I’ve made the decision to go back to taking pregablin 100mg every few days or when I need it. It works from the first dose and really does provide deep relief from intense anxiety and emotional dysregulation.I believe that one day, when my therapy is finished, I’ll be medication free.

56,Pregabalin,Generalized Anxiety Disorder,10.0,,"December 3, 2020",16,"Pregabalin has helped me immensely with GAD. I have had diagnosable anxiety for about 7 years. Failed with Lexapro after 3 years. I then switched to Pristiq which kind of helped. Augmentation with Lyrica has helped me sleep at night and just feel calmer during the day. Along with doing cognitive behavioral therapy (incredibly important), I can finally see the light at the end of the tunnel and it's incredibly refreshing. I have been at my current dose of 660 mg Lyrica CR for 8 months. I would say I started feeling the benefits within a week, but with therapy and the right medication the long term benefits are setting in. Negative side effects are maybe slightly more tired and increased appetite. If you exercise it's not a problem.I'd highly recommend anyone struggling with anxiety and not receiving relief from first line agents to talk with their provider about lyrica. It can be a second line treatment on it's own or as an augmentation agent (e.g. with an SSRI or SNRI)",Miss J

The Pregabalin was stronger than I expected (I'm a big man 120kg) and I experienced some dizziness. When I drank 3 beers (3x 0.5 Ltrs) one evening I had some heavy suicidal thoughts the next morning. I stopped taking Lyrica after 3 days because of the suicidal thoughts, On the fifth day, due to my intense anxiety, I decided to take just 75mg in the mornings and cut out all alcohol.

It seemed like whatever med the doctor wanted to try on me for my anxiety didn’t work. The antidepressant, Celexa, was suppose to help with GAD but as far as I’m concern, I believe it made my anxiety worse. My anxiety became very crippling. I asked to be taken off Celexa and put on Prozac recently. He made the change for me and said he wanted me to try Lyrica for my anxiety since the gabapentin and clonazepam I was on didn’t work well for me. I tried the Lyrica at 50 mg 2X a day that my doctor gave me a script for, and the crippling anxiety was gone and the depression lifted. I’m glad I found something that finally worked for me. I know everyone is different and what may work for one person may not work for another. You just have to find what works for you. My girlfriend can’t take Lyrica.

It can be quite addictive so again be careful and do not mix it with alcohol as it can increase the effects by at least x10 in my experience, dizziness, nausea and unstableness.

I’ve drank alcohol (because it uses the same receptors and can give immediate relief), but there is nothing that really helps. It’s a diabolical medication that is currently ruling my life. I feel constantly anxious, frightened, I have a permanent headache, ‘flu like symptoms, pins and needles in my skin, problems with vision, the list goes on. I feel trapped. I’m desperate and feel there is nothing I can do. It’s a terrible drug. I was given it to reduce my anxiety after I lost two sons in tragic circumstances. I’m sure I would have been better off dealing with my grief in a natural way. It’s incredibly potent and addictive. I’m now doubting if I ever will get out of it after several attempts. ❤️",Lizzywood

I've been taking Pregabalin for 2 years now. I started low on 25mg three times a day. After taking it, for about 3 hours, I felt energetic, had weird tingly sensations on my skin, and probably some other stuff. Nothing too wild, but not always pleasant. After 3 days the side effects from taking a new medication went away completely. After some months I took 50mg three times a day as 3x 25mg didn't cut it. Pregabalin helps me to go back to a calm state of mind, a less tensed up body, takes away the spikes of anxiety and panic attacks, and after therapy, now even completely prevents anxiety from forming. For example: I had anxiety flying, but 30min to 1h after taking Pregabalin, the anxiety went away and I even enjoyed the flight! No side effects worthy to be mentioned.
