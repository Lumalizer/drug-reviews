0,Cymbalta,Generalized Anxiety Disorder,10.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"February 19, 2022",0,"I’ve been on cymbalta twice in my life for anxiety, depression, neuropathy, and chronic pain. The first time my dosage was too high, and I was put into a serotonin overdose basically which was absolutely awful, I looked stoned, pupils huge, felt like a completely different person. But this second time I’m in a lower dose. 40mg once a day and it have been a life saver. It’s helped all of the issues stated above. I have lupus and fibromyalgia, so my whole body aches most of the time and this has helped tremendously.",Anonymous
1,Cymbalta,Generalized Anxiety Disorder,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"February 3, 2022",0,Only took one capsule and had the worst reaction of my life. After half an hour started to hallucinate and couldn't feel my arms or legs. Felt like I was glued to the bed while seeing things that weren't there. Was in and out of consciousness and woke up in the middle of the night being violently sick. Had to go to A&E where they gave me an injection to stop me throwing up. For the next three days I had no appetite and slept almost constantly. I took the pill on Saturday and didn't feel normal again until Tuesday. I still don't remember how I got back from hospital. Phoned the doctor on the Wednesday and he said it was something to do with too much Serotonin. It seems like people either respond well to it or become very sick. But overall it didn't suit me so wouldn't recommend.,Jk7711

6,Cymbalta,Generalized Anxiety Disorder,3.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"December 24, 2021",1,"So I was on Zoloft for 10 years and it stopped working. Panic attacks, anxiety, derealisation. I can barely function some days. After months of increasing dosages and trying to get in to see a psychiatrist (3 month wait) I was switched to Lexapro which didn’t help me, then we switched to cymbalta. I haven’t been able to come down less than 50mg of zoloft the whole time. Now two months after being on cymbalta I never saw much change. One day I missed a dose at night and the next day I thought I was dying. Didn’t realize I missed the dose but it was bad. So I’m trying to go down from 60mg to 30mg and the first few days have been very rough. Old symptoms of anxiety and panic that never left have gotten worse. Either the Cymbalta was helping some but not enough or these are symptoms of withdrawal. For me this medication wasted another 2.5 months in my search for a med that can give me my life back.",Farmboy

10,Cymbalta,Generalized Anxiety Disorder,10.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"October 27, 2021",4,"I have GAD but compared to some it’s quite mild. I believed it was from working in stressful environments. Have had 3 major depressive episodes in 10 years. Wasn’t sleeping, wasn’t eating, anti social… spoke to my Dr and he suggested Cymbalta as it was different to the SSRI family and also having arthritis, it can be used as pain management. This drug saved me. I now sleep all night. I no longer feel anxious. My depressive episode seems to have abated. I have low energy but always did prior to taking this drug. I think also it has affected my libido but I would rather live without sex than live with anxiety!!! I won’t be stopping this drug any time soon. Tapering onto Cymbalta was interesting. I could feel it working from the very first pill. I take it before bed and if I was even one hour late taking it (30mg dose) I would get massive headaches. Once I went to 60mg all the side effects disappeared and I have been on it now for 15 months with no issues.",miss_rockets

12,Cymbalta,Generalized Anxiety Disorder,6.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"August 28, 2021",3,"Made me really tired at 60mg so went down to 30.  I was on that for a year, I was very stable and everything seemed very blah. I gained 10 lbs because I couldn't taste anything and nothing sounded good so I would get really hungry and just eat whatever crap I could stomach. Getting off seemed insurmountable because if I missed a dose it was like dizziness, migraine, brain zaps, full body aches, nausea. I switched to Prozac and then went off Prozac after a month with no withdrawal from either. I still have anxiety though, so I am back on Cymbalta 20 mg. I get brain fog and can't focus on it but at least I'm not anxious, right???",Bannie

I am not exaggerating when I say Duloxetine has saved my life. It has saved me from absolutely crippling, mind-numbing anxiety, just wish I had started earlier. Unfortunately this whole process is trial and error and I had some bad experience with other meds (looking at you Effexor), but I started to feel better after just a couple weeks on the Cymbalta. Was a little activating at first and made me feel a little on edge but after a bit that went away. No negative side effects, just have really vivid dreams now.

14,Cymbalta,Generalized Anxiety Disorder,10.0,Taken for 10 years or more,"June 6, 2021",37,I’ve been on Cymbalta since it got the market since 2000 it was a life saver for me I felt better the very first day ! I was up to 60 mg for about 10 or 11 years then my anxiety came back like it stopped working or my body got used to it tried to increase to 90 mg but just made me so tired. So we tried to switch to a multitude of medications nothing worked like Cymbalta so I went back on it. Coming off it was a complete nightmare and I am so much better on it than off. I’m just now trying to up my dose again to 60 mg after just being on 30 mg for the last 6 years. Before Cymbalta I wasn’t even able to drive a car without complete panic and hysteria I’ve suffered with this crippling disease since I was young this was the first medication to give my life back I don’t know what I would do without it honestly medications are different for everyone but for me it saved my life !!,Ippie

16,Cymbalta,Generalized Anxiety Disorder,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"January 24, 2021",31,"This is my first time taking cymbalta. Today was my day one. Let me say. I took it with food. And within two to three hours, I started experiencing severe nausea. Within another hour I became very jittery and it felt like my skin was humming with electricity. Fast forward an hour and I can only compare this feeling to doing a tab of acid minus the hallucinations.. Or what I assume people feel like doing speed because I bounced on a yoga ball for two hours while feeling very manic. Crazy. Edgy. Like I was pumped full of adrenaline and needed to jump out of my skin while laughing and humming. I kept twitching and kicking my legs. Do hand snaps and rubbing my hands up and down my jeans to the point where I have rubbed my palms raw. I took ONE pill. The ONLY upside, is that my sciatic pain is basically gone. Which is heaven. I'm about 9 hours in and I'm finally sitting down but I cant stop fidgeting or bring myself to eat anything despite my stomach gnawing at me. Will update in a week",Bells

18,Cymbalta,Generalized Anxiety Disorder,1.0,,"August 19, 2020",49,"I was prescribed Cymbalta for generalized anxiety disorder, and I was on it for about 10 months. I can’t say it really helped me with anxiety, and I finally decided to try to come off it because it was raising my heart rate. After trying to slowly taper for 2 to 3 weeks, the side effects were so extreme and so uncomfortable that I decided to stop taking the medication altogether in an attempt to rid it from my body as quickly as possible. I experienced every single one of the potential side effects of withdrawal. The worst side effects have been dizziness, vertigo, brain zaps, brain fog, nausea, and diarrhea. These side effects have been going on for three weeks and have been getting worse with no end in sight.I have no idea when or if the side effects of withdrawal will go away, but I can do nothing but lie in bed until they do.

Anxiety is still there a little bit, but no panic attacks. I had some nausea and diarrhea but I’m not sure if that was from Cymbalta as a bug was going around. First few nights I had sleep issues, but those have passed. No sexual side effects thus far. I was on lexipro before and I hated it. Get like a zombie. This is altogether different.

So my psych prescribed me 20 mg dose of Cymbalta to start to help with my severe anxiety. For the first month I noticed a small change in the way I felt. So we decided to go up to 30 mg. One week after starting the new dose, my life changed. I remember waking up one morning and just being happy. Everything seemed lighter and my anxiety as well as depression lifted. Unfortunately two months into that, my bipolar mania symptoms started coming back. So we are trying to figure out how to safely manage all symptoms.

I took 1 tablet 30 mg yesterday afternoon with lunch and experienced nothing until night. I was having constant random visions all night, when I finally got up in the morning I began shaking, my skin felt like it was burning, I was on fire hot, and my mouth was so incredibly dry. Then I got the chills. Shaking, burning skin, chills, dizziness went all day. I was wiped out tired and could not eat. I was in bed all of this beautiful day until 4:30pm when I forced myself up. Honestly I felt poisoned. I drank 2 gallons of water waiting to flush this out of my body. It was about 28 hours from the time I took it until I felt somewhat back to normal.",Lexi20

24,Cymbalta,Generalized Anxiety Disorder,8.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"October 18, 2019",68,"Had a great 12 years with lexapro 10mg, it stopped working.  For the last 3 years I’ve tried Wellbutrin, Prozac, Effexor, Vybridd, Trintellix and Cymbalta.  With all of them I felt a floaty, sedated feeling all day long.  Cymbalta is starting to work.  I believe its the noreprephrine component of the drug that’s helping me stay more focused and energized during the day. I’m on 60 mg daily.  Pyschs and GP’s alike don’t know the effects of withdrawal unless they’ve experienced it themselves.  Not every patient’s cure comes out of a medical text book and docs need to understand that you’re not neurotic and these drugs effect your delicate brain chemistry.  Rapidly tapering from one drug to another can be disastrous for some.  My thoughts are with those going through this, trying to land on the right med.",Jason

I had a horrible experience with Prozac. I suffer from GAD, fatigue, & was dealing with back & neck pain. Drug started to work pretty quick. Doc switched me from Zoloft to Cymbalta when Zoloft stopped working after a year. I had some dizziness & felt off for a couple of weeks but nothing like Prozac. Started out at 30mg during the transition but jumped up to 60mg after 2 weeks when I stopped zoloft. The drugs has worked well so far. I can see a significant reduction in anxiety which has given me the energy to start exercising again. It's also put me in a good mood & reduced pain by 80%.

26,Cymbalta,Generalized Anxiety Disorder,9.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"June 17, 2019",160,"I have anxiety, panic disorder, autism, ADHD, sensory processing disorder. Overall I have had a very positive response to duloxetine. Side effects: There is the initial fatigue & a lot of yawning. That went away after about 3 weeks. I had difficulty peeing during the night. This faded over time. Difficulty to orgasm after I went up to 90mg, this faded after a few weeks. This medication makes my brain work better & gives me a better quality of life and an opportunity to live rather than just survive. If you identify with any of my symptoms & have been recommended duloxetine by your doctor, I say it is worth giving it a try. When it is the right medication for you it is life changing!

27,Cymbalta,Generalized Anxiety Disorder,9.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"June 13, 2019",145,"One year Cymbalta honest review. I started Cymbalta about a year ago as I have struggled all my life with social anxiety and general anxiety. About a month before I started taking it, I started getting really bad anxiety attacks every day and had my first ever panic attack (Which prompted the doctor's visit for help).The first week was OK. I had no appetite and felt anxious all the time for no reason. Then, suddenly my whole mood changed and I became a lot more cheerful and talkative person. I actually wanted to do things, instead of stay at home. Note to everyone with bad reviews: this doesn't work overnight. It takes time for the chemicals in your brain to balance. I would say it takes 2 weeks to see some effects to take place, and at least a month or two to experience the full positive effects. But, it is so worth it! I highly recommend Cymbalta to those struggling with depressive thoughts or anxiety disorders! I have only had ONE anxiety attack since taking it, and no panic attacks",Beth

I tried going back on it after 9 months when my anxiety returned but it gave me worse anxiety!!! Now I'm on Cymbalta I love this medication. I'm on 60mg 4 weeks now. The first 2-3 weeks were rough but all side effects went away. Just stick with it my doc said to use .25 MG of Xanax initially to help get through the rough first weeks. Now I only take Cymbalta. It made me drowsy in the morning so I take it at 2 am when I get up anyway to go to the bathroom. This helps me go back to sleep and I have no problem getting up in the morning. Lastly I can stay up later then I used to and I get more done. Another side effect is less arthritis pain and no more bladder leaking.

Within an hour I was falling asleep on the couch, which I never do. Usually I have insomnia, but I slept through the night.

I attempted to go about my normal day, but found myself having to take two naps because I was excessively tired. I've been watching and reading about this medication all day and I am terrified to take another dose because of the side effects and ultimate withdrawal I'll experience if it doesn't work out.

46,Cymbalta,Generalized Anxiety Disorder,1.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"May 3, 2017",47,My thoughts on Cymbalta: Cymbalta has left me in a fog. I have no feelings- NONE. Driving is a chore as my eyes are excessively shifty. God forbid you ever forget to take your medication as you will be stricken with these obnoxious little shocks (which I've recently learned were  called 'brain zaps'.) My heart beat is erratic. My brain is unable to form the right words when I talk which causes me to pause when I speak. I zone out regularly. I've been trying to taper off of this medication and am on day 9. The withdrawals are debilitating. I cannot focus. My chest and my jaw are tense. My fog has worsened significantly. Driving is dangerous as my vision is blurred. I am angry and easily agitated.

A lot of people are quick to write this drug off, and I admit the initial side effects can be tough like nausea and feeling so tired, but after taking 30mg for three weeks and increasing to 60, with the increase I noticed a quick change, my anxiety decreased rapidly, and instead of tiredness I began to experience an almost high feeling which sometimes makes me hyperactive, but surely that's better than anxiety and depression. I would recommend taking it, but give it a few weeks and take the proper 60ng dose before you judge it; it's really helped me, it's got me out of s really bad place.",Nicknamealreadyinuse
