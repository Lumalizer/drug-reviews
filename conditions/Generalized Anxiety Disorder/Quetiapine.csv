2,Quetiapine,Generalized Anxiety Disorder,10.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"January 23, 2022",3,"I've been on this medication for roughly 3 months and take 30mg every night. It has completely transformed my life and for the first time I feel stable and in control. I'm 23 years old, have a diagnosis of c-PTSD and generalised anxiety, and have had relatively regular panic attacks from around 16 years old. I used to get into a very heightened emotional state very easily, would regularly freeze up and become incredibly dissociative for hours on end, would be very nervous out in public, near crowds and in noisy areas. With the exception of some people in my life, I believed I fundamentally could not trust most people, I was very sensitive to (perceived) changes in other people's emotional state and I was incredibly hypervigilant around men. I also used to struggle to fall and stay asleep and was incredibly sensitive to being touched, to the point it sometimes felt uncomfortable or even distressing. Now I am immensely more settled and able to employ what I've learned in therapy.",Rach
3,Quetiapine,Generalized Anxiety Disorder,8.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"January 17, 2022",1,"I was prescribed this for my constant anxiety/mixed state depression, and also to help me sleep. I only took 50mg a night, I was supposed to go up in dose but never got that far. Took it for about 5 days, it worked both for sleeping and also to relax me and eliminate anxiety (honestly sometimes it felt like I was mildly drunk).The reason I had to stop taking it though was EXTREME CONSTIPATION.Everyone's body is different and I probably had a very unusual reaction, but just be on the lookout for this issue. I would definitely recommend trying this drug though and see if it's right for you, because it did help a lot with anxiety and insomnia.",Claes
4,Quetiapine,Generalized Anxiety Disorder,10.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"January 9, 2022",1,"I had drowsiness at first with it, and dry mouth. Drowsiness wore off and worked great for my anxiety after many different anti depressants were tried.",Quetiapine
5,Quetiapine,Generalized Anxiety Disorder,9.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"January 4, 2022",0,"This is an interesting medication. The first 2-4 weeks can be tricky.  I found that it does have a sedative effect and was amazing for sleeping. It did also make me agitated/jumpy if I took a higher dose (weirdly paracetamol or ibuprofen lowered this effect). Can be helpful to try a lower dose and see the difference. I did feel foggy and had trouble concentrating the first month. Your body does need to get used to it, then I saw major improvements in mood and reduction in depression and anxiety. It is good because it immediately reduces extreme anxiety (compared to SSRIs and SNRIs) and then kicks in to help over the longer time. I would use in conjunction with working with a psychologist. If you're going through anxiety or depression this medication is a much better option to benzos or SSRIs or SNRIs.",Anon
6,Quetiapine,Generalized Anxiety Disorder,7.0,Taken for 5 to 10 years,"December 30, 2021",1,"I absolutely loved this med at first. Started off with 25 mg cut in half and taken morning and evening for anxiety. Upped to 50mg XR after a few weeks. Had it for 4 years and it worked wonders. Then I started experiencing brain fog, memory loss, extreme fatigue, depression and many many more. It took me 2 years to realize it was the drug causing it.

Instant release ones were ok, it was like the volume in my head had been turned down, it was really good to feel absolutely nothing for a change.Eventually I started taking the extended release ones and I had to stop as they gave me extremely stiff legs- so bad I could barely walk. During the time I took them - about a month I noticed I worsening anxiety and irrational thoughts, though I'm not sure if this was due to quetiapine. No improvement on mood. Legs got back to normal 2 days after stopping the tablets.",Akasha

I lost hope that time, and thought that I would be mentally ill forever but luckily after taking this drug I snapped me back to normal again. Experiencing those side effects and also aware for the danger of this drug but that's not a problem to me as long it keep me from going crazy permanently.

10,Quetiapine,Generalized Anxiety Disorder,7.0,,"November 18, 2021",0,This is a huge life savor at times. This works similarly to Xanax which I was once on for a couple months. Quetiapine works for me mainly for sleeping more than anxiety. The thing about quetiapine is that it is a step up from SSRIs when it comes to anxiety medication which SSRIs don’t do anything but help with depression. I will say that it is a less potent anti anxiety medication due to it not being FDA approved. My only issue is that I cannot function on it like I could Xanax. Tbh the  issue I have is my new doctor cut me off if any anxiety meds and upped my SSRI and AD med which won’t do anything but help my depression.,Tman

12,Quetiapine,Generalized Anxiety Disorder,10.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"October 27, 2021",9,I would have panic attacks everyday and my anxiety really manifested itself as nausea and vomiting. After trying 3 other medications and having continued anxiety/vomiting I was prescribed seroquel. Within a week my life was changed. I stopped having anxiety and throwing up. I finally put on some weight and people stopped commenting on how sick I looked. I am so happy with this medication it brings me to tears. My life was so miserable before it.,No regrets
13,Quetiapine,Generalized Anxiety Disorder,10.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"October 25, 2021",2,I’ve been taking quetiapine for 3+ years and it has literally saved my life. Living with undiagnosed GAD until I was 42 years old and then finally diagnosed and put on medication changed my life for the better. I was initially on a high dose (300mg XR) and over a period of 2 years plus 60mg Aropax I reduced to 100mg IR and stopped using Aropax. I did gain a lot of weight (15kg) but I have managed to lose it all after reducing my meds to just 100mg seroquel. So you can lose weight so long as you exercise daily and limit alcohol. I highly recommend this medication as it has worked perfectly for me and enabled me to maintain a highly stressful and well paid job.,Sarah

It's taken over a year to find the medication that works best. My prescriber decided Seroquel would be a good option for me, so I tried it out. I take 75mg in the morning and 75mg at night. I haven't felt this good in years. All my anxiety is gone, and my OCD has became significantly easier to handle (also on clomipramine for OCD). This is a really good medication for me, and I strongly suggest it for other people.",realjesynelson
15,Quetiapine,Generalized Anxiety Disorder,,Taken for less than 1 month,"September 24, 2021",0,"I started taking 25mg of quetiapine and found taking it around lunch time works best for me. I have been so grateful to this medication as I finally feel I have been able to deal with my intrusive thoughts so much easier than when I didn’t taken quetiapine. I see a lot of reviews here claim they feel zombie like or can’t stay awake, however I found that because my anxiety was so high that when I did take my quetiapine I even out so I feel relaxed and more focused on my work. A bonus is that for me I find my appetite has been reduced (and I needed to lose some weight). Again, there are reviews of those saying they have gained a lot of weight, but this is down to the individual and their  lifestyle . So if you follow a good diet and keep active where possible you will be just fine!",Lou
16,Quetiapine,Generalized Anxiety Disorder,7.0,Taken for 5 to 10 years,"September 22, 2021",1,"I've been on it for several years and developed type 2 diabetes. I was put on Metformin and my blood sugar was always elevated even when fasting. My sleep wasn't great anymore because I developed mild sleep apnea. I also discovered that my testosterone levels were below the clinical normal levels. Since stopping Seroquel and starting testosterone injections my diabetes is gone, my RBC and hemoglobin have improved. I still have anxiety but I'm taking an SSRI which I dislike and I am weaning off of it. I find another med to be effective in anxiety and it is called clonidine. I may have ADHD because I tried Adderall in the past with success but my current doctor doesn't want to prescribe it again. I have an overactive mind with anxiety. Seroquel is good for the short term otherwise get your glucose checked. Also, note that Seroquel can drop your thyroid levels. It is a rare side effect.",Walt5
17,Quetiapine,Generalized Anxiety Disorder,9.0,Taken for 5 to 10 years,"September 18, 2021",3,"I have anxiety, depression, and insomnia, and have been on this med for about six years at 200mg. I also take gabapentin, Xanax, and Remeron. It works well at getting me to sleep. I'm groggy most mornings for at least a few hours. It does help keep me in a fairly neutral emotional state most of the time, although it works on my anxiety more than my depression. It has not affected my bloodwork or appetite at all, but I've slowly gained maybe 20 pounds since I started it. Which is baffling, as I eat very little. If I miss a dose, the withdrawal is intense, and includes drenching hot flashes, itching everywhere, and rebound insomnia. Overall, I feel it is a worthy part of my medication regimen and will likely need to take it for the rest of my life.",LittleOlCatLady

When I visited the hospital for worsening panic attacks. I was given this, and the psychiatrist straight up told me that the goal was to make me too tired to be anxious. My instructions were to take 12.5 mg twice per day (morning/night). I don't know why, but I guess this is either stronger than all the other psych meds I've tried, or I'm sensitive to it somehow. I couldn't attend school because I was so tired constantly, I slept for I think 16 hours straight, but the quality of it was absolutely terrible- nightmares, sweating, frequently waking up and then falling back asleep. Also it gave me constipation. I take trazodone every night as well, but both these meds are at a low dose so the doctor wasn't concerned. I don't know. It's certainly not for me, but it does wonders for others!!",sarahjbrandt

I’m also prescribed 1 mg prazosin for CPTSD from ongoing trauma (childhood sexual assault) and these 2 medications work well to help me sleep. I take them at night. I was so afraid to go to sleep, due to having nightmares, flashbacks and waking throughout the night, with worsening anxiety and panic the next day. I was in a never ending cycle of misery, basically. I am on day 5 of these medications, and I know it takes some time to work but I feel much better already. Still having some issues with mild outbursts anger etc but these are manageable with the 2 medications and little to no side effects, unlike other meds I have taken in the past.

27,Quetiapine,Generalized Anxiety Disorder,1.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"January 19, 2021",15,"I was on this drug for about 2 months. It never cured my anxiety or depression. I'm very sensitive to medication side effects, so I started on only 6mg and went up to 12mg. It helped me sleep which was nice, but made it difficult to wake up in the morning. The longer I took it, the more I noticed the side effects, they seemed to be getting stronger. I felt weak and sick before lunch, like it was interfering with my blood sugar levels, eating helped this. I often felt light headed. Straight after taking the medication at night, I felt like it was making my heart race, towards the end it was also giving me chest pain, that's when I stopped taking it, I was scared of having a heart attack. The drug never made me feel any better. As soon as I stopped the drug, I felt like a weight was lifted off me, I felt so much more calm and happy! Turns out the medication was making my anxiety and depression worse! I didn't realise. So happy to be off it.",Emily
28,Quetiapine,Generalized Anxiety Disorder,10.0,,"December 29, 2020",14,"I’ve been diagnosed with insomnia and anxiety. I’m not sure how I got on quetiapine since I’ve been on it for 5 or so years. I was hoping weight gain would be a side effect I had since in underweight but no such luck. I don’t really have any side effects from it, I take 25mg before bed. My anxiety has improved tremendously over the last 5 years, it doesn’t make me so sleepy that I have to go to sleep. It doesn’t take me hours to fall asleep anymore and I no longer wake up after sleeping for an hour or two like I did before. The only downside I’d say is if I don’t sleep more than 4-6 hours I do NOT want to get up. That’s pretty easily manageable for me, I just take it and go to bed/play on my phone for about an hour before I want/need to go to sleep. It takes about 30-45 minutes to kick in so I’m usually sleeping by the time I need to go to sleep.",xrx44x

Tapered off the benzo which took me 2 years of nightmarish withdrawals...I now take quetiapine 25 mgs at night. And half of a 12.5 prn.  It helps and is not as addictive as a benzo for anxiety.

This may have triggered bipolar, depression and anxiety?  Anyway was on 300mg a day and put on 20kg while doing manual work and martial arts..  I was sleeping 12 hours at least on the weekend.  And it makes you really hungry after you take it so you eat more as well.  But this medication did stabilise me up to a point where I could work.  The thing is my cognitive ability has dropped, I have a shocking memory, get confused, my mind goes blank and have lost jobs because of it so reducing my dose, has to be done slowly otherwise you could get bad withdrawals and give up.

Anxiety meds were not working so the doctor prescribed Seroquel 25mg. I’m very sensitive to medication side effects so I had to cut the pill in half. The anxiety went away almost immediately before going to sleep. This is powerful medication and works very fast. When I read of others taking such very high doses I don’t know how their body can take it. I’m so grateful there is something I can take for the awful anxiety and panic related to oral steroids.

I speak from experience with bipolar, major depression, and anxiety. The side effects are far worse than any benefits. The only benefit I have found is some help with sleep, but even that is inconsistent and sometimes my overall sleep is much worse (fewer hours). It causes massive weight gain over time and dependency. Once you take it, you feel like you won't be able to sleep without it.

I reached a crisis point around 8 months ago where everything seemingly  stopped working all at once. The benzo treatment had reached the end of it's usefulness and was now causing anxiety instead of easing it. This was when my doctor prescribed low doses 12.5-25 mg. 1-2 times a day of seroquel  to augment my Paxil. I am not going to rave about it, but it is an alternative for those who are slim on options.

Yes it makes you a bit drowsy and you do eat more .  It reminds me of the munchies.  Best thing is just to go to bed.  I wanted to say though that the dose is critical.  For sleep dose very low.  I take 12.5 mg .  I went up to 25mg and was a zombie it was horrible.  If you have a shitty time try halving t he dose.

I tried Wellbutrin for a while and it made me crazy...for anyone who is nervous about taking an antidepressant or benzos I would highly recommend this medication. I feel like myself - no tremor or fogginess or zombie-like feelings. Occasionally my legs feel a bit restless but I can deal with that. No issues if I don't take it for a night and want to go for drinks or something. No issues with weight gain.Highly recommend! I got my life back.,lovexpickles

After about 12 months of taking it, I began to feel very lethargic, and generally slow, and my short term memory basically stopped existing.
