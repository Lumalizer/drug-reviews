0,Tamsulosin,Urinary Tract Stones,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"February 7, 2022",0,"I'm a 45 yr old female. This is my 2nd time getting kidney stones, but this time Laser Lithotripsy was needed because my stone was a little over 25 mm just floating around in my right kidney. It caused me pain once it would reach the opening of the ureters and float back into the kidneys once I would drink a lot of water. I was prescribed this once lithotripsy was done and a stent was in place. For me it worked and was a miracle pill. It was easy to urinate and I would barely feel the discomfort in my bladder and flank once you reach the end of the stream. It definitely was helpful once the stent was removed 7 days after. The only side effect I had was the sleepiness during the day, insomnia at night along with excessive sweating all day. It looks like all of us whether male or female will react different to this medication. I was instructed to take one 0.4 mg capsule once a day 30 minutes after breakfast. For me the timing is key and it helped me out.",Ochuncita5
1,Tamsulosin,Urinary Tract Stones,8.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"January 10, 2022",1,"I'm from Chile, and I'm a woman and at least once a year I suffer from kidney stones. Now I'm suffering because of them. Last year when I had them, doctor gave me flomax, but I never use it. Since I passed the stones that were making me suffer before I could take the pills. But now, I've been taking flomax the last two days and in these days since I started taking flomax I passed a 2mm and 3mm stone. I'm not sure if it's the effect of the pills. But before taking it, even if I drank a lot of water never passed anything from that size. On Saturday 8 of January at night I took one pill of flomax and like forty minutes later I peed and I saw the 2mm stone. And yesterday 9 of January after I took flomax, like 50 minutes later I passed the 3mm stone. Even if all day I was drinking water. So I feel that flomax helped me. Tomorrow I will have my pielotac exam so I will know for sure what size are the stones.  And I haven't had any side effect for taking the pills anything not drop pressure.",Marlott
2,Tamsulosin,Urinary Tract Stones,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"November 10, 2021",0,"So, I was diagnosed with a 4mm kidney stone on the right side and was prescribed and taken flomax on 11/5/2021, I still haven't passed the kidney stone... now it's 11/9/2021 and I've decided not to take it anymore for a few reasons. Yesterday I randomly passed out when I was going to my desk to get back to work. I work from home. I passed out and my Dad came to check on me 3 hours later to find me on the floor. I couldn't remember what happened earlier that day like taking my daughter to school or even working. I already have insomnia and have a hard time sleeping anyway. In addition to that since this is anonymous I also want to say there has been a decrease in sexual urges and the ability to climax. Granted I'm divorced and am a single parent who isn't dating and kidney stones are painful enough to decrease the urge anyway; but I have a condition that allows me to climax with no physical interaction, which I can control. I have not been able to do so since taking Flomax.",29yr Old Female

I am 30 years old, and haven’t had a prescription drug since I had my wisdom teeth removed. #1 I was diagnosed with a 4mm kidney stone moving. The ER doc prescribed Flomax. I did as I was told as the pain was the most intense I’ve ever felt. So whatever. Following taking this med , I was urinating a lot, up every other hour on the hour,(never before), then comes the headaches and the vision frustration. I’ve had 20/20 vision since I can remember. Never have I needed glasses or contacts. So I panicked. THEN comes the sexual side affects that no one warned me about -  zero ejaculation or orgasm whatsoever. I’m 30 years old and have a high sex drive. No one mentioned this to me when giving me the medication. Dry ejaculation, zero orgasm and serious prostrate area pain and throbbing. Yikes.

11,Tamsulosin,Urinary Tract Stones,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"August 4, 2021",0,"Having a 5mm stone, I needed all the help I could get, so took the ER prescribed Tamsulosin willingly even though I tend to be sensitive to meds and am on heart meds. Had a very bad reaction - BP dropped very low, had tachycardia, arrhythmias, and felt awful 3 days in. Told my urologist, prescribed another drug Alfuzosin (same type - alpha blocker) and assured me that I wouldn't have the same issues. Wrong! It was even worse. My heart was constantly pounding, couldn't take my heart meds because my BP was way too low. It took me over 2 weeks to feel relatively okay and function, but still suffering with a kidney stone. They use half the dose of Tamsulosin in other countries. We should have the option here, especially for women.

They gave me pain killers and flomax at the ER. Also prescribed it for 7 days.  I came home and started taking one .4mg pill every night.  I was getting very stuffy and having dry mouth.  Then day 3, I masturbated and absolutely dry ejaculation.  It freaked me out because I've never experienced this in my life.  A little online research lead me to this page and I see that its a common side effect of flomax.  As someone who's gonna be getting married soon and would like to have kids one day.  I stopped taking it immediately. I took it for 4 days in total.  I'm hoping this dry ejaculation goes away because I'll take kidney pain over not being able to have kids.

18,Tamsulosin,Urinary Tract Stones,10.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"September 4, 2020",56,Flomax (tamsulosin):The side effects that people are talking about they think are from Flomax-they need to consider whether that what they think are side effects from Flomax may have been from the kidney stone because severe pain can cause those symptoms.  I’m on Flomax on a regular basis for bladder problems (Flomax is a common medication used in MS to help with bladder problems) and I have never had any side effects from it. When I had two kidney stones that were severely painful it did not take me as long to pass them as it normally takes to pass a kidney stone so please do not blame side effects on Flomax automatically. I am so thankful I was on that drug when I had the kidney stones. Because as painful as they were I passed them quicker than I normally would. Like I said I have never had any side effects from Flomax and have taken it every day for years.,Bethany

The medication has been successful in relaxing the bladder neck muscle and prostate to allow the stone fragments to pass. However, men should note the possible sexual side effects. I have experienced retrograde ejaculation. The relaxed muscles allow the seminal fluid to flow backward into the bladder. There are no forceful involuntary muscle contractions and no pleasurable fluid release from the penis. I experience a few weak pulses and a few drops of semen ooze out. I've felt no discomfort when seminal fluid flows into the bladder, just a feeling of fullness that is relieved later during urination. Overall, sexual satisfaction is diminished by 50%. No issues with maintaining a firm erection, responding to stimulation or feeling the initial stage of orgasm, but without the physical relief of expelling seminal fluid from my body I feel frustrated at the end of sexual activity.",GW

36,Tamsulosin,Urinary Tract Stones,8.0,,"November 27, 2019",27,"Flomax (tamsulosin):Flomax makes it easier to pass stones, makes it more tolerable, too. But how do you get the stone to start moving when it doesn't choose to do so on its own and is sitting there just waiting? My experience is based on passing two 4mm stones and a couple of smaller ones, it may not work with larger stones. In my experience walking out in the cold air helps with moving the stone. Dress warmly to avoid catching a cold but let the cold creep up into your body from the feet.Drink lots of water beforehand with some lemon juice in it, take your Flomax, and walk in the cold air. You can practically feel the  movement and pain of the stone  soon after. Just have your pain med handy and repeat this several times a day.I do not know if this really works or if it was just a coincidence in my case that I walked in cold whether several times before seeing my stone pass; a spurious correlation perhaps. But, if this is a real effect, it may have something to do with cold-induced diuresis.",3M

I've been in the hospital a total of 35 times in the last year. Each for Kidney Stone pain. After my third visit the doc gave me Flomax and it passed 5 stones all 3-5mm in size within 30 minutes of me taking it. Since then no other Doctor would give it to me because ""I didn't need it"". Well finally yesterday my doc agreed with me and wrote the prescription I passes a 8mm stone 30 mins after taking the Flomax. I HIGHLY recommended this to anyone who is suffering from a kidney stone. It reduces the pain and makes the passing a WHOLE lot easier.",Eldar

BUT, the Dr. put me on FloMax; and after just 10 days on this med I passed the stone with very little pain!  I regret waiting so long to get help with it.  The only side effect I had was the sexual dysfunction described, but it was so minimal it wasn't bothersome enough for me to stop taking the medicine.

I have a history of cardiac reactions to medications and sometimes a stone will cause my heart rate to skyrocket to 160 with a blood pressure of 165/100, but it is clearly the stones and not caused by Flomax. My only complaint is that my insurance refuses to pay for this medicine because I am a woman. I don't think that is right, and I'm not going to accept that kind of discrimination.
