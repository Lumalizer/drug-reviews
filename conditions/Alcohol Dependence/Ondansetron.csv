0,Ondansetron,Alcohol Dependence,7,,"May 5, 2017",17,"In my chequered relationship with alcohol (35 yrs) I have found my way back to sobriety crippled with nausea and vomiting many times. I have tried the usual suspects over the years. Medicines which increase motility (emptying of the stomach more quickly) right up to phenothiazines (used to relieve amongst other things sea sickness and psychosis. Google anti-emetics.If you want to get sober, do it over a one week to ten day period with family support (probably more important than any drug) ask your Doctor for a serious anti sickness drug , keep hydrated !!! Drink ginger tea ! And rest.Good luck, my advice was sound for me. God Bless Dave. X",Ddaveyduff
