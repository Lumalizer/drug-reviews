1,Vivitrol,Alcohol Dependence,9.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"September 24, 2021",0,"I was a binge drinker for many years drinking 4 to 5 nights a week anywhere between 1-2 pints of vodka on average, sometimes more.  I started on the pill form and was still drinking just slightly less.  I decided to put forth a little extra effort to try to quit once I got the vivitrol injection and had minor cravings only the first week which I was able to push thru.  I now have no cravings and no desire to drink.  I experienced no side effects , except for tenderness at the injection site, as well as a big bump for up to two and half weeks after receiving the injection.  I would take that over my drinking habit any day!",Kdub79

BUT, it has taken a toll on my sex drive. i just don't feel the need to cum. I hope this doesn't continue and affect my relationships. Also I am a wee lethargic but I can battle that for now.

3,Vivitrol,Alcohol Dependence,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"August 14, 2021",4,"This is the first time I have ever posted on a forum regarding medication, but I felt compelled to for this one.  I am a 52 year old male.  Started drinking vodka pretty lightly a few week nights and on weekends about 4 years ago.  Following a divorce and the loss of a few loved ones, my drinking got progressively worse where I would make a beeline to the liquor store after work every day.  Every night sitting alone in front of the TV getting drunk.  Drinking by 10am on the weekends.  Just pitiful.  I wanted to quit so bad but couldn't.  I always had the shakes and they wouldn't go away until I had first cocktail for the evening.  Always felt like throwing up in the morning and called off sick or took vacation days just because I felt like crap or afraid to get thru the day at work.  Concentrating at the job was a real challenge and downright sucked.  I started taking oral naltrexone.  It was amazing.  Literally, on day 2 the craving virtually disappeared.  I couldn't believe it!!",K9handlr
4,Vivitrol,Alcohol Dependence,10.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"August 4, 2021",2,Vivitrol has absolutely changed my. There was no doubt I was headed towards death. Since my 1st injection I've been sober 89 days. Cravings are minimal. It's kind of like a flip of a switch. Alcohol just became kind of eh. I prefer my la Croix. I have little to no side effects. My hands are a little shaky and I eat less. But other than that I finally feel alive again. No more hangovers or throwing up at 4am. I actually get real sleep. You can't go wrong with this injection . It is a little pricey but some insurances will work something out with you.,C
5,Vivitrol,Alcohol Dependence,10.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"July 24, 2021",7,"Long story short, I was in a downward spiral, suicidal, I was drinking a handle of vodka every two days. I had tried everything to quit. I did 30 day in patient rehab where I started Naltrexone. Switched to Vivitrol right before I left rehab and continued the shots for a total of 8 months.  Fast forward I am over 2 and a half years sober. Life is AMAZING. I wake up every day so glad to be sober. I don’t miss drinking, I don’t think about it, I never ever crave it, EVER. It is like my brain was reset to someone who never ever drank. You could not pay me a million dollars to take a drink now. I did not do AA, or any kind of support other than self help and using the tools that I learned in rehab and family support. Everyone has a different journey, but if you truly in your heart have zero desire to drink then all the rest of that stuff isn’t necessary in my opinion/in my case.  I will be forever grateful for the opportunity to take Vivitrol. Good luck.",Marie
6,Vivitrol,Alcohol Dependence,1.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"July 3, 2021",1,My husband got his 3rd Vivitrol injection 2 weeks ago Wednesday it cause brief paralysis in his leg and a severe reaction in the injection site. He has severe muscle and tissue damage and his sciatic nerve is extremely inflamed. I would NEVER want anyone to experience these symptoms and even if it was a one in a million thing I never want him to get the injection again. Our lives almost changed in 10 minutes but two weeks later here we are and he is still having problems walking and we have zero answers to what is going on besides it’s the injection that caused it.,Marissa

I’ve been an alcoholic since I was 17, I’m 19 now. I drank everyday, lost jobs, lost friends & family. I called alcohol my best friend, she helped me deal with everything although putting me into risky situations. & now I see how much damage the substance has done, I’m glad I got put on this med after I was hospitalized for a drunken suicide attempt.

8,Vivitrol,Alcohol Dependence,1.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"May 7, 2021",5,"It made me really depressed.  I will never take it again.  It is day 42 and I still feel happiness being blocked.  Other things to note, it blocks the effect of coffee, exercise, and pleasure in general.  Would not recommend.",Bill
9,Vivitrol,Alcohol Dependence,1.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"April 25, 2021",8,"Received the injection 30 days ago and have been depressed since.  Endorphins play a major role in depression.  Endrophins get released in response to drugs and alcohol.  They are also released naturally by coffee, exercise, and good experiences.You only need a small amount of this drug in your system to block the 'happiness' receptors.  The drug will be gone anywhere from 25 to 50 days.  I cannot wait for it to be gone.  Yes I'm not drinking, but I'm miserable.  Who would want to live like that.  My doctor said she was surprised that dysphoria happened, well then that doesn't help me",Bill
10,Vivitrol,Alcohol Dependence,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"April 24, 2021",3,"This medication worked immediately! As in same day immediately! If you have the desire to reclaim your life from alcohol get the injection! Sing a song, phone a friend...something to occupy your mind when they administer the needle. It hurt but more like a bee sting as opposed to hurt like hell You will survive! For some reason, the first day I was extremely emotional (rage+depressed) it went away the next day! Once your head is clear, listen to your soul for what to do next. Getting to the root of the trauma is necessary for total healing! Grace & Peace!  Hope this helps!",Grace
11,Vivitrol,Alcohol Dependence,1.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"March 21, 2021",12,"First off, this is perfect if you are a hardcore addict for alcohol & heroin. I had a problem with alcohol because of anxiety but I would only drink 1 time a month or longer. Naturally my anxiety is kind of bad, but with vivotrol it's 100x worse it comes and goes and it sometimes feels like a bad drug trip. I have been on it for 3 months and ever since I've gotten the injection I have felt this way. The doctor said it's not known to increase anxiety but that's completely  rubbish. I am no longer going to continue using it I am 9/10 sure that's why I feel like rubbish.So I would advise you to proceed with caution because once it is in you, there's no turning back. Try naltrexone in pill form first and see how you feel with that. Otherwise, stay with counseling and meetings and just plain old abstinence",Brendan

13,Vivitrol,Alcohol Dependence,10.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"February 23, 2021",11,"No side effects, didn’t feel the needle in my bum.  I started drinking again around 45 yr old after being sober for 20 years.  My drinking got progressively worse and couldn’t stop. My GP could tell I was struggling and tried so hard to help me.  After 5 years of trying and failing I got the shot last month.  It’s been amazing.  For me it took away the cravings and I no longer drink at home or by myself.  No desire.  I have been able to enjoy a cocktail with friends but I don’t want to keep drinking after.  I can stop! What a blessing.  It’s working for me and I hope it continues.  I think it’s worth a go  for anyone looking for relief.  I hope it works for you as well as it’s worked for me!",User

15,Vivitrol,Alcohol Dependence,9.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"August 26, 2020",27,"I have been on Naltrexone and more recently Vivitrol for 8 months now. I was a heavy opiate user and occasional drinker, having tried Methadone and Suboxone in the past I knew that options just led to dependence on another drug so after my latest relapse I got on it. I am not going to lie the first week was hard, that's mostly my fault because they told me I had to stay sober for a full week before taking it and I didn't. But now, after having time to adjust I gotta say it is a lifesaver for me. I have gotten acne on my back and even on my scalp which I have heard others say happened to them but other than that zero side effects so far. If you have an opiate addiction and you want guaranteed results TAKE THIS MEDICATION, I cannot stress enough how much this has saved my life. I have no cravings and no overwhelming urge to get high.",Remy

I've used drugs in the past, a lot, however booze is always my gas to get the motor going. The only times I did not drink was when either I was in prison, unsuccessfully rehab stays, or detoxes. Other than that, I was drinking. I wanted to try this injection, because I had tried naltrexone pill form in the past and I got massive migraines from it. Needless to say I been out of prison and off parole for 7 years, got my own apartment but kept drinking, and getting into scuffles without police in the middle. I drank my last drink on a Monday, and called to ask for this shot Tuesday.  I got it And the rest is history. I had no symptoms. No withdrawals, no side effects, no bad dreams, nothing but the good things that came with it. Sobriety, and free of cravings, free of thoughts, free of desires.",Anonymous

The stumbling part has gone away I’m starting to be able to see straight. I’m still tired. But I’ve been up all day. My doctor said the side effects will pass with in the next couple of days.

I keep trying to find every way possible to get over and get high or drunk anyway possible and pass my drug test I just want everyone to know that I am an absolute idiot and it sucks because sometimes I feel like there's no other escape for me and I just want to drink or do drugs but I definitely can't get away with doing drugs.  Anyway I figured let me take the Vivitrol shot and maybe I can still drink on it if you're wondering what it is like to drink on Vivitrol just saying my body feels drunk but my mind is absolutely miserable and I wake up in the middle of night feeling like someone stuck a needle full of meth in my neck and it's so hard to get back to sleep  - very poor choice of mine",Nick

Nothing could stop me from going to any convenience store to buy my daily 24 pack. Since the first day, ALL of my cravings have disappeared! I have "" debated"" with myself to ""test"" this injection, however, I immediately lost all interest. No explanation other than that! Just zero interest. After 30 years of this poison - poof!!

22,Vivitrol,Alcohol Dependence,7.0,,"October 8, 2019",50,"1st shot of Vivitrol on 9.9.19 & I immediately tried to test it but didn’t go hardcore.  I did feel motivated to clean and care about responsibilities more than usual.  Within a few days I was drinking heavy again & it was BAD.  I suggest taking Antibuse before you even leave the office & keep taking it for at least a week so drinking is not an option.  On 9.23.19 I met with my therapist and our talk helped but I still wanted to drink.  Today, 10.07.19 I had my second shot.  I was determined to not drink for a week to see the results and somehow ended up at an AA meeting on a whim.  There I met a woman that talked to me for 3 hrs after the meeting where she called me out on my BS in a way only another alcoholic can.  My recommendation:  Vivitrol shot, Antibuse at first, a therapist you trust and respect (good luck, It’s a challenge), & AA meetings.  Vivitrol is not a miracle.  It is one ingredient in a recipe.  Alone it’s like eating plain flour and expecting it to taste like cookies and cake.",Sandy Marie
23,Vivitrol,Alcohol Dependence,10.0,,"September 22, 2019",56,"Vivitrol injection on 9.19.2019.  Can you drink? You can, but it doesn’t feel good.  We know alcohol is a depressant.  I always enjoyed the euphoria and was too drunk to recall the depression.  Drinking now makes me feel heavy and dull and a bit nauseated.  I failed the oral dosage because an hour before drinking I was salivating for the buzz! Now, I only have to be strong once a month while my resolve is strong.  Now I CAN DRINK LIKE A NORMAL PERSON if I want.  I’ve been sleeping long hours of good sleep. I’d been living on vodka/smoothies/vodka smoothies and whatever junk was deliverable after I was intoxicated. I’m eating better now.  I have an 8:30am tomorrow.   Sucks, but I won’t have a towel nearby for 6am vomiting.  I also won’t be up for a morning run, but  I will awaken unafraid to check my texts.",Jamie

She says it is helping her, but I don't see it.  Paying $1200 for a shot that doesn't work is not sustainable.  I was hoping for a silver bullet, but was unfortunately wrong.

26,Vivitrol,Alcohol Dependence,10.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"July 6, 2019",115,Imagine your favorite food. Let's say it's pizza. Now you're at your favorite restaurant that serves pizza just the way you like it. But something is different and you're just not in the mood for pizza so you order something else. That's exactly what Vivitrol is like. You can think about drinking but you're just really not in the mood for it. Also if you're an alcoholic you've probably been prescribed an SSRI by now and with those it takes weeks to start working but Vivitrol is pretty immediate as in it only takes maybe an hour two to become really effective. If you're reading this you've probably tried all the unless things  out there and it just can't reach that itch. Vivitrol is about as close to a magic shot as you're going to get for alcohol problems,Anonymous

I am surrounded by alcoholics & my husband is an alcoholic. I got a promotion at work and one morning I went to work and thought I was going to die. I couldn't take it anymore & told them I had to go to the hospital. I detoxed at a great facility. They were incredible. They saved my life. I had previously been asked if I wanted the vivitrol shot & I declined. This time I begged for the shot. Best decision I ever made! I got my 4th shot last week. I have no cravings. I have mental clarity. I'm off antidepressants. I have lost 27 pounds. Side effects...my body aches but I'll take it. I have no appetite so when I do eat. I eat healthy. Except for chocolate. I am extremely grateful for Vivitrol. I know it has saved my life. I actually died on my birthday a couple years ago from severe alcohol withdrawal & critically low potassium. Didn't stop me from drinking again. Vivitrol did.,Cherrypie

31,Vivitrol,Alcohol Dependence,9.0,,"March 9, 2019",61,"I've struggled with alcoholism for 10 years. Vivitrol was suggested before but I couldn't afford it.  I was able to find a clinic that got a federal grant for Vivitrol. The first 4 - 5 days I was tired, leg cramps up thru my buttocks (felt like the flu),  hip and ankle pain, irritable, sad, nauseous.  Side effects eventually went away after 1 week.  Cravings have been minimal to non existent. Yesterday I was irritable; had a bad day at work which triggered me. Decided what the hell and see if the drug really did take away that feel good feeling.    I drank about half the amount I usually do and it didn't do anything other than the physical side effects.  I ended up pouring the rest out and went to bed.  This is a miracle!  I am so grateful!  Looking forward to continue using it for this year while I complete my 12 steps in the AA program so I will not only be physically healthy, but mentally and spiritually too!

My med doctor recommended Vivitrol and I thought ""what the hell"".  Took a shot in the butt that day and when I left I decided to test it.  Drank as normal but magically the pleasure of drinking just wasn't there. I would physically feel the effects but it was not pleasant and the hangover as if I were in high school.  That was the last time I drank...nearly two weeks ago. Cravings are very sparse and I'm seeing the world differently. I feel better, people say I look better, and my social anxiety doesn't seem anywhere near what it used to be.  Essentially I just feel more confident.

Those are symptoms of acute withdraw and depression due to early sobriety. Many of my friends swear by this shot. For me personally I love it. I have no craving for opioids or alcohol completely. As with many of my friends the shot gave me an awesome surge of energy about 10 days after going on naltroxine! The injection site was sore for a week but it's the only side effect that I got.

So far it has helped with the craving to want to drink. The side effects that I have is I’m constantly tired and have no motivation. I just feel blank and withdrawn from the world. I hear this lasts for only 4 days or so I truly hope that’s true. Hopefully my body adjust to this medication (injection) so I can get up out of bed and enjoy life again.

The urge to drink went away and it felt good knowing that even if I drank on the shot I wouldn't feel the warm fuzzy feeling that I was so addicted to. So recently I did drink and I feel so terrible shakes.. Sick to my stomachs. Alcohol withdrawal is terrible and it really sucks. Now I know why I love feeling sober. Vivitrol had not only kept me sober it truly saved my life because I know that I have control of my life. I would recommend this to Anyone who has a problem with alcohol. It truly takes the cravings away. And helps you find yourself.,Annngggell
48,Vivitrol,Alcohol Dependence,,,"January 8, 2017",31,"I am a member of a support group for a person in their mid-20's recovering from alchohol addiction.  The person has been taking monthly Vivitrol injections for about 6 months.  The injections have helped the cravings, but not 100%. When the person did consume alcohol (vodka) it produced severe flu like symptoms that were similar to alchohol withdrawal. Has anyone else suffered these types of symptoms drinking alchohol while on vivitrol injections?",SupportingGroupMember Question
49,Vivitrol,Alcohol Dependence,8.0,,"November 25, 2016",25,"I think my experience with the clinic may be coloring my opinion of Vivitrol. As far as I know, it DOES work to curb cravings--I haven't had any to speak of in the 6 months I've been getting the injections. OTOH, I've noticed that my depression gets significantly worse for a few days after each injection, then it eases up to my normal low (someday I hope to feel actual happiness again). My problem is with the clinic and the hour+ wait times. I'm clean. I'm in therapy. I go to AA meetings daily. I have a strong support system in place. But I'm thinking of discontinuing because I don't have 2.5 hours to spare every time I have an appointment (commute to clinic, time at clinic, commute to work).",Anonymous

52,Vivitrol,Alcohol Dependence,10.0,,"November 27, 2015",204,"After battling the bottle for 30 years I am so Grateful that I found this. I tried everything from AA to SMART Recovery and to be honest while each program has it's good points they did not take away that urge to drink. This did. Instantly. Vivitrol has really been a blessing because it not only blocks the urge to use but it goes the extra step of blocking the high if you do drink  I was just a Garden variety alcoholic. I drank around the clock. I would even drink in the shower. The funny thing is I never bought into the disease model even while I was sober for years at a stretch. I would eventually pick up a drink because the urge, that voice, the Beast was always there. Not anymore! Vivitrol stopped the brain imbalance that MADE me drink.",GRATEFUL...

54,Vivitrol,Alcohol Dependence,8.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"March 31, 2015",199,"After partying almost 30 years in a successful, trouble free life, I began taking antabuse pills a few years ago without a recovery program.  I was told about vivitrol and it interested me in quitting my prescription hydrocodone, benzo, and drinking. My 1st shot was 10 days ago and it does make your mind content. I can tell the drug is wrapped around my receptors. If I where to attempt to take a drink....it feels like I already had one. Not taking pills is no big deal either. I still take a sleep aid at night and Aleve  or Ibuprofen for anything else. I. Am now experiencing eating and sleeping like I've seen normal people do all my life.  A spiritual feeling should come along with that for those of you who are willing to make a change.",Hollister resident

In some ways, I think it also helped me quit smoking.  However after 13 shots I feel stiffer than I ever have, and I was wondering if anyone else shared this experience.  Some days my shoulders are almost immoveable.  I didn't feel this way before the medicine, and I was wondering if there was a correlation.  It is actually painful to get out of bed some days.",jbirmi58

58,Vivitrol,Alcohol Dependence,9.0,,"November 9, 2011",193,I just received my second Vivitrol shot.  I am so glad that I did.  It has helped curve my cravings and have had no side effects.  I've been a heavy drinker for 16 years and have struggled with relapsing for a few years.  I know this isn't a cure and this is a daily disease that should never be put on the back burner but not having the cravings where the only thing I can think about is that next drink helps a ton.  To anyone that is thinking about trying Vivitrol I would say stop thinking about it and do it.,kyle5050
