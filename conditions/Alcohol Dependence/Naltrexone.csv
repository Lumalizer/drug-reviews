0,Naltrexone,Alcohol Dependence,10.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"March 30, 2022",0,"Be patient.  I started Naltrexone because I needed to drink less and stop the progression of my drinking but I wasn’t ready to stop. It immediately helped cap me at two or maybe three drinks a night rather than four to five, or more. It stayed this way for about two years except when I’d drink liquor, which I began to do more often. Finally, I decided to start taking nights off, and then I decided to not drink at all Sunday through Thursday unless there was a social opportunity. I stopped talking Naltrexone on my off nights so there was no excuse to drink if I felt an urge. I’ve lost ten pounds and now vanity is motivating me. One Friday night with bourbon and waking up feeling like I used to every morning  was enough to rid me of the urge to have more than two drinks on the weekend, if I drink. When I do, I take a pill. My drinking is finally under my control and I can drink when and if I want, but I don’t abuse it any more and it isn’t going to kill me. Stick with it.",Niets
1,Naltrexone,Alcohol Dependence,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"March 6, 2022",0,"I have been on this since 3/2 and it is an absolute savior! I was prescribed it due to a rising alcohol problem. It completely ceased all cravings! Finally, I’m free from it! Added bonus, I did not realize it was also used for weight loss. I had definitely put on about 45lbs during my alcohol issues. In less than a week I’m down 10lbs after this morning! It totally curbs food cravings as well. It also has helped my moods as well (in combination with my antidepressants). As for the side effects, definitely take it at night. Makes me sleepy if I take it in the morning. Drink lots of water or you will have constipation issues. Expect nausea the first couple days (my first full day on it, I threw up a sandwich I tried to eat). After a couple days you’ll be back to normal, just without cravings. I do meal replacement shakes now, because I forget to eat and one day I had less than 500 calories.",smpowers6677

As for naltrexone l can honestly say it did what was claimed by my psychiatrist, which was it reduced my cravings by a lot.  My doctor prescribed naltrexone to me to treat  my methamphetamine addiction and I have been clean for about four months now which is great.  I'm glad they have drugs on the market to help with addiction issues.  A lot of great people struggle with addiction and need a little help to overcome those issues.

I used to drink pretty much all day for 2 years. I had few times where I was able to go a month or two without drinking and then convinced myself I could drink moderately. Immediately after (within an hour) of taking it the first day, my thoughts of alcohol lessened. By the time I was on my third day, I didn’t think about alcohol at all and when I did, I had no interest. I couldn’t believe it. I had little side effects. I felt foggy headed for the first few days. That subsided.",Anonymous
5,Naltrexone,Alcohol Dependence,8.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"January 20, 2022",0,"Greatly reduced desire to drink. Went from about a liter of vodka a day for 12 years down to just  couple of beers few nights. Before naltrexone, I thought about how to get alcohol and hide doing it, it literally consumed every waking minute in my mind. On naltrexone, it completely removed the obsession and caring to drink. Unfortunately, I did have a few side effects that lead me to stop taking it. The minor side effects would be that I had cold sweats almost every night and would occasionally get brain fog very bad. Those were manageable. The side effect that wasn't manageable was that twice in a 6 week period I had a panic attack. I'm almost 40 and have never had a panic attack or anxiety attack. These panic attacks were so bad I had to be hospitalized and put on a psych hold each time",therodo

I no longer plan for drinking and  I no longer always order alcohol at restaurants,  or go to breweries to drink three or four beers. I can go on trips and not drink.  My mind does not gravitate to when I will get my next fix of alcohol.   When I read some of the experiences here, they say they were drinking for six years or ten years.  But, what about 40 or 50 years?  I wish they had this drug a long time ago.",LLS
7,Naltrexone,Alcohol Dependence,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"November 6, 2021",3,"I’m a 27F who has struggled with alcohol dependency since I was a teen. It runs in both sides of my family - almost lost my mom to it via liver failure when I was 14, then actually lost my dad to it when I was 18. I binged/blacked out a lot in my teens/early twenties, but for the past few years have become a habitual drinker, drinking 4-6 tall boys a day. I tried quitting cold turkey many times, without success and didn’t think AA was really for me. I decided to tell my doctor and she prescribed me 50 mg of naltrexone. I’ve been on it for 2 weeks now and have never felt so free from the grasp of alcohol. I took 25 mg for the first week and then upped it to 50 mg. I had a stressful situation earlier this week and cracked open a can out of habit, I used to turn to alcohol in times of stress but this time I didn’t even finish the can! Cannot recommend this drug enough if you are struggling with alcohol dependency.",freeatlast
8,Naltrexone,Alcohol Dependence,10.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"October 12, 2021",1,"Ummmm wow....I drank, heavily and daily, for ten years plus. I'm not sure when it started, mid thirties, by 38 I was drunk every day. Today I've been taking naltrexone for 2 months, I haven't been drunk in 50 something days, and haven't even had a beer in weeks. But it's easy... I did not expect that at all. I expected to grit my teeth through quitting (again), and eventually fail. I expected meetings, or rehab, or eventually to get fired and end up homeless (again). But I'm taking good care of my cat, have become one of the top guys at work, and I almost never think of alcohol. I tried to have a big high point ""beer"" (mike's harder lemonade) but as soon as I felt the beginning of any effects, I lost interest!!! I quit drinking accidentally!!! Never in my wildest dreams. Amazing drug, thank you, I have real hope for my future now. Ask your doctor, I'm so glad mine knew before I did. I did experience some shakes, insomnia, and never hungry. Worth it IMO",Kent ish

For 13 years now I've spent a quarter of my day thinking a beer would be okay right now, another quarter thinking I'd really love to have a beer right now, a quarter thinking heck how can I get a beer, and a quarter doing anything possible to get ahold of another beer. Took my 1st dose of Naltrexone yesterday and had zero desire to drink. To be honest though my desire was already lower than normal yesterday before taking the Naltrexone. Took it again today and my desire feels like zero. I went ahead and had my morning beer like usual anyway and it wasn't as good as usual and I don't have a desire to have another one. My body feels a little restless but that is the only side effect so far on day 2.",Jon

I started on the pill form and was still drinking just slightly less.  I decided to put forth a little extra effort to try to quit once I got the vivitrol injection and had minor cravings only the first week which I was able to push thru.

Woke up with horrible headaches, had crazy dreams, spaced out during the day, nausea, vomiting, muscle aches weird stretching feeling. Been off it for 48 hours and feel so much better. Going to go back to good old willpower and therapy to kick my drinking habit. I read such positive things about this drug but it sure didn’t work for me. Maybe I should I have tried it for longer but I just couldn’t handle the side effects. Made me realize there’s no such thing as a magic pill.",Emily66

Blackout binge drinking at night. I have been in and out of AA for nine years. I discovered Claudia’s TEDx talk a few years ago and took no action. On July 25th of this year, I blacked out, tore up my ankle so severally I needed surgery and broke my leg. That was it for me. After the surgery being off the pain meds, I started Naltrexone Aug 30th. 25 MG for a week and 50 MG form then on. This is the end of my 2nd week. No cravings for alcohol what so ever. NONE. That in itself is a true miracle. AA just wasn’t for me. A lot of great people and fellowship BUT just not for me.

I am a 52 year old male.  Started drinking vodka pretty lightly a few week nights and on weekends about 4 years ago.  Following a divorce and the loss of a few loved ones, my drinking got progressively worse where I would make a beeline to the liquor store after work every day.  Every night sitting alone in front of the TV getting drunk.  Drinking by 10am on the weekends.  Just pitiful.  I wanted to quit so bad but couldn't.  I always had the shakes and they wouldn't go away until I had first cocktail for the evening.  Always felt like throwing up in the morning and called off sick or took vacation days just because I felt like crap or afraid to get thru the day at work.  Concentrating at the job was a real challenge and downright sucked.  I started taking oral naltrexone.  It was amazing.  Literally, on day 2 the craving virtually disappeared.

Since my 1st injection I've been sober 89 days. Cravings are minimal. It's kind of like a flip of a switch. Alcohol just became kind of eh. I prefer my la Croix. I have little to no side effects. My hands are a little shaky and I eat less. But other than that I finally feel alive again. No more hangovers or throwing up at 4am. I actually get real sleep. You can't go wrong with this injection . It is a little pricey but some insurances will work something out with you.,C
17,Naltrexone,Alcohol Dependence,10.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"August 3, 2021",3,"It has been 8 weeks since I started Naltrexone and The Sinclair Method.  There are just two rules, 1) take a pill one hour before your first drink of the day and 2) record how many drinks you have every day.  My carvings in the late afternoon are gone and my consumption is down 75%.  I used to drink every day and now I only have a drink 2 or 3 days a week.  Before starting on Naltrexone I read the book, The Cure for Alcoholism: The Medically Proven Way to Eliminate Alcohol Addiction. I really didn’t want to share my story with everyone and that is what appealed to me about The Sinclair Method – no making amends, no self-loathing and no meetings for the rest of your life.  The research says it works for 80% of the people. The biggest surprise so far is not how easy it has been but that no one has ever heard about The Sinclair Method and Naltrexone.  I’m stunned that my doctor and all my friends & family members in recovery had never heard of it.  There is hope.",Lucky
18,Naltrexone,Alcohol Dependence,10.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"July 24, 2021",7,"Vivitrol (naltrexone):Long story short, I was in a downward spiral, suicidal, I was drinking a handle of vodka every two days. I had tried everything to quit. I did 30 day in patient rehab where I started Naltrexone. Switched to Vivitrol right before I left rehab and continued the shots for a total of 8 months.  Fast forward I am over 2 and a half years sober. Life is AMAZING. I wake up every day so glad to be sober. I don’t miss drinking, I don’t think about it, I never ever crave it, EVER. It is like my brain was reset to someone who never ever drank. You could not pay me a million dollars to take a drink now. I did not do AA, or any kind of support other than self help and using the tools that I learned in rehab and family support. Everyone has a different journey, but if you truly in your heart have zero desire to drink then all the rest of that stuff isn’t necessary in my opinion/in my case.  I will be forever grateful for the opportunity to take Vivitrol. Good luck.",Marie

Once I got in the car to leave for work I could really notice an energy feeling, almost too much so I knew it was the Naltrexone kicking in.  I was also becoming nauseated and a little dizzy.  I have a long drive to work so I was becoming concerned that I was not coherent enough to drive.  However, after about 30 more minutes I started feeling fantastic!  The energy feeling leveled out somewhat, nausea went away and I had a feeling of euphoria. Very happy, calm, and PAIN FREE. Just feeling in a great mood, no bad side effects.... yet.  So far it has also suppressed my appetite.  If this makes me feel like this every day I would want to take it forever.  We will see how it does with my alcohol desire.

Naturally my anxiety is kind of bad, but with vivotrol it's 100x worse it comes and goes and it sometimes feels like a bad drug trip. I have been on it for 3 months and ever since I've gotten the injection I have felt this way. The doctor said it's not known to increase anxiety but that's completely  rubbish. I am no longer going to continue using it I am 9/10 sure that's why I feel like rubbish.So I would advise you to proceed with caution because once it is in you, there's no turning back.

Somehow managed to be a high-functioning alcoholic, but could tell my drinking was getting heavier and felt like it was starting to affect my health, memory and overall mental acuity. So I decided to try naltrexone/TSM in early December, just before the holidays to really put it to the test. It had a huge impact on my drinking behavior right away. Instead of thinking all day about drinking, starting as soon as possible after work, and passing out on the couch after 8-10 drinks, I have only had 1-2 beers per night for the past month. 3 max. Even during the holidays! I've poured out several drinks. This is a HUGE change in my relationship with alcohol. I can now see a life ahead in which thinking about drinking doesn't play a role in my decisions. One downside was really bad anxiety for the first couple weeks, but it eased up. My primary doc didn't want to prescribe naltrexone, so I found an online provider who would. Very glad I did!",Wrigley

It dulls the cravings and allows me to think clearly through them. I feel a bit more like I did before alcohol changed my brain chemistry. Every time I have a craving, it feels like the feeling is being ""smothered"" or ""cut off"", depending on how strong the craving is. The only negative side effect I've had are very mild and short (5-10 second) headaches that happen maybe two or three times a month, and have lessened the longer I've been on it.

Three months in, I still drink most nights, but it just cuts off after two drinks or so.  I spent a long time building this habit and good wine still tastes delicious, so I still enjoy it and the routine is there. But I'm a moderate drinker now, and I think, if what I've read is correct, I may be soon reaching a stage where cravings reduce even more and I will be able to move toward situational versus habitual drinking.

I suggest taking Antibuse before you even leave the office & keep taking it for at least a week so drinking is not an option.  On 9.23.19 I met with my therapist and our talk helped but I still wanted to drink.  Today, 10.07.19 I had my second shot.  I was determined to not drink for a week to see the results and somehow ended up at an AA meeting on a whim.  There I met a woman that talked to me for 3 hrs after the meeting where she called me out on my BS in a way only another alcoholic can.  My recommendation:  Vivitrol shot, Antibuse at first, a therapist you trust and respect (good luck, It’s a challenge), & AA meetings.  Vivitrol is not a miracle.  It is one ingredient in a recipe.  Alone it’s like eating plain flour and expecting it to taste like cookies and cake.",Sandy Marie

The naltrexone using the Sinclair Method of taking a tablet one hour before taking my first drink has completely changed my relationship with alcohol. I still on occasion get the urge to drink but I simply don't drink very much when I drink after taking a tablet.

I tried to quit alcohol for 10 years with AA and other methods including a stint inpatient. Nothing worked. This medication finally worked for me and I have been sober for a year and not sure why it took so long for me to find this medication. I know some methods work for some and not others. You must take it everyday even before you are going to take a drink for it to be successful. Alcohol starts to feel and taste like soap water that is fills you up and you feel buzzed but just not the same euphoria the alcoholic gets from that first drink. My anxiety went away about 6 months sober so I do not need to drink anymore. Loving life and thankful to the inventors of naltrexone . Gratefulness and thankfulness and less selfishness also learned in AA and through treatment eventually helped too but it takes some time to get there. Use both treatment and this medication.

He has a long term problem with alcohol and so detoxed before he took the Naltrexone. Initially the drug reduced his daily alcohol intake but after a few weeks he started to creep back up to his previous levels. His alcohol addiction was stronger than the Naltrexone . He stayed taking one pill a day for 8 months and it has made him very depressed and anxious - much worse than before he took the drug. He is now trying to come off Naltrexone which is proving extremely difficult. Overall Naltrexone has done him no good at all _ in fact it has harmed him and made an awful situation worse.

The one thing I did not see mentioned was the ability to eventually stop taking naltrexone and stay sober. You definitely can. After about 90 days of drink free life, I was able to stop taking naltrexone daily. The trick is, you must not have any alcohol without taking a dose of naltrexone an hour prior. If you don’t plan to have drink, and are in control of that fact, then no naltrexone is needed.  But absolutely no cheating allowed. If you do cheat you’ll open the Genie bottle again (no pun intended). You must start back on naltrexone immediately if you do to reestablish your control. Otherwise, if you are dry and comfortably in control of all drinking temptations, you can skip the naltrexone. Don’t test this by just having that ‘one’.

Sinclair is the doctor behind discovery that these meds block the reaction to alcohol. I'm suggesting this as these meds are often prescribed somewhat incorrectly. It's not ""magic"" for most but what works for 80% of those who follow the protocol is a slower de-addiction process requiring you to continue drinking. Many practitioners prescribe ""take every day w/abstinence"" but the ""miracle"" in this type of med is that it DE-ADDICTS you and changes the neuronic uptake.
