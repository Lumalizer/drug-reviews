I have had no generalized symptoms such as flu like symptoms as many have described. My doctor always prescribes an oral antiviral to take each day during the treatment. She said it is to prevent fever blisters but maybe it  prevents the flu like symptoms too.  Many of the crusty, scaly  spots on my nose and cheeks but not all were smooth after the first treatment.  I misunderstood and did not use  the cream long enough the first time. This time I will do it correctly.",windows 10 mail
3,Imiquimod,Keratosis,10.0,,"January 26, 2021",0,"This is the second winter using imiquimod cream. Last winter I did the back of my neck, ears, forehead, chin and the décolletage area of my chest. I got a robust reaction on all area and good results. Side effects were nasal congestion, low back pain, painful skin where treated and massive itching. Skin also had weeping and oozing. This winter I started treatment on my entire chest area. Started applications 2/3 x a week. Definitely getting a good reaction with sores developing with moderate weeping/oozing. I’m having flu like symptoms, fatigue, more nasal congestion and even more pain and itching than last year. No low back pain. Benadryl helps with itching and Aquaphor helps with pain and healing. This treatment is not for the faint of heart so definitely not for everyone. However, it does a great job attacking and getting rid of those precancerous cells.",Reggie

I have gone through the recommended 6-week Zyclara treatment and my skin is much better, almost completely clear, with just a few little areas remaining for which my dermatologist has recommended a further 'cycle' of 6 weeks. which will start in the next few days.I had the usual unsightly red scabs on one side and then the other. They were rather sore and itchy, but not unbearably so. Many friends have commented on how much better my skin looks, which is encouraging!I also have a compromised immune system, due to a chronic leukaemia, but no obvious side effects.I live in Spain, so have had to be careful about further sun exposure.",Justin
6,Imiquimod,Keratosis,8.0,,"March 19, 2019",6,"Zyclara (imiquimod):I'm on the second round of applying Zyclara, week two after using it for 2 weeks on and 2 weeks off. The first round I had no side effects and very minimal skin changes until day 13. I saw my dermatologist on day 15 and she said she would consider it a mild to moderate reaction. I had a crusty place on the bottom side of my nose, and a pimple like place on the skin next to my nose and one on my nose. I'm on day 8 of round 2 and noticed a pimple like place on the skin next to my nose in the same place as before. I was so scared to try this lotion after seeing the pictures of what could happen. I had MOH's surgery on my nose last summer and would like to avoid having that again if at all possible. I had good results, very minimal scarring and it's not noticeable now but the whole process of the surgery just grossed me out.   My doctor wants me to apply the Zyclara for 3 two week on and two weeks off sessions. I hope this does the trick, it seems to be working.",Dakota123

Also squamous cells and ##AKs & SKs frozen every 6 months. Aldara too intense. Been using Zyclara every winter for YEARS. Haven’t been brave enough to do my face but need to. Takes 5-7 days to start seeing effect; usually stop around day 10. It’s like trying to stop a speeding train - continues to intensify for several days after stopping. Oozy, itchy just like everybody says but it works! Flu-like symptoms because Zyclara stimulates an immune response. NOT topical chemo. I do one area at a time and rotate - back or chest or arms or legs. Stimulated lymph nodes are a normal immune response. If I feel flu I hold off for 2 days. Believe me the train keeps running but the symptoms reside. Every other day from there then it’s time to stop. I love that it flares spots I can’t see and heals better than burn/scrape or freeze.  It’s a drag but I’m glad to have the option.",Sdollar

I'm bald and so, for now, the treatment area is all on the top of my head.  I have about 30 growing red bumps; the pain and itching are manageable.  The worst part is flu-like symptoms, low energy (can barely take care of daily essentials), loss of appetite, and inability to sleep (this side effect just started last night so hoping it subsides quickly).  I'm about 2 weeks in now with 3 or 4 weeks to go.Yes, it's highly unpleasant for many but still, as others have commented, perhaps the best alternative to lesser-effective treatments.BEFORE YOU TAKE THIS MEDICINE:  If possible, have someone that will grocery shop for you and walk the dogs, etc.  There will be days when you're too weak and nauseated to do this if you're like me.",Brad
10,Imiquimod,Keratosis,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"July 14, 2018",5,"My dermatologist prescribed imiquimod (very $$) for my chronically peeling skin & squamous cell cancer in situ on my nose. I used it as directed for 8 days when I noticed a large, weeping sore worsening on my lip and torn mucous membranes inside my lip. I was told this was not related to the drug. But after doing research and seeing identical pictures online, I stopped applying the drug. My symptoms continued for 2 weeks- excruciating pain, swelling, cracking and bleeding lips, large ulcers inside my mouth - it was horrible. I also became anxious, agitated, and kept crying out of the blue- not at all like myself. Using this drug was a big mistake. And I still have my original peeling nose.",Suzie
11,Imiquimod,Keratosis,10.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"July 6, 2018",11,"Zyclara (imiquimod):My dr prescribed Zyclara for use on some areas on my face she was concerned about.   Zyclara gets rids if the cancerous cells. After the first few days it started working, oh boy!  To be honest I looked like a drug addict, my face was red with blisters, open sores and itchy.   The only side effect I experienced was a mild/moderate headache so the process was very tolerable for me.   Second round and very little disruption of the skin.   Before you start the treatment you may want to check your calendar for any upcoming events such as weddings, reunions, parties and such because your skin will look terrible during treatment.  The initial treatment was awful but the end result and the way my skin looks is well worth the discomfort.  Some insurance plans do not cover the cost of Zyclara because it’s extremely expensive.  Ask your Dr for coupons or look online as most insurance companies won’t cover it.",KC

At day 7 he saw me and stated that I look like I may be one that has the more severe reaction. He stated for me to try and make it to the two weeks but if not, just as long as I could stand it. It was for a lesion on my nose. I look like Rudolf, yes. It is very red, swollen and blistery yes.  The skin is also thickening and I look horrendous. I do have the flu like symptoms and the very swollen glands, but what is making me stop is I started getting that histamine reaction you get when you are having an allergic reaction and everything got super itchy. With my nose already super swollen and my neck swollen from the swollen glands I am not going to take any chances with breathing difficulty. My hope is that I have done enough treatment for this to work. If it works, it will be worth it, but I will be very reluctant if I have to do it again.",CDW687

However, into my 2nd week, the side effects were awful.  Severe flu like symptoms; lower back pain, nausea, sore throat, head and chest congestion, it sucked!

During the first cycle, I experienced flu like symptoms and the open sores.  I had to wear band aids on my face to hide the sores and it was very uncomfortable.  However, within 3-4 months, I received numerous comments about my skin and how healthy it looked.  I applied a second dose a year ago to isolated areas and did not have any of the severe issues from the first time.  My dermatologist recommended stopping the treatment at the first sign of open sores or major irritation, but I never had to follow that advice.

I have been using this now for 3 weeks without any breaks and have 3 more weeks to go as per my derm. I haven't had any flu like symptoms and side effects are just on the treated area, extreme swelling, raw skin, oozing, redness, slight burning and scabbing.

Dr. told me to stop.  Symptoms still continue after 5 days off.  He refuses to say it's from the cream, but I am never sick and only became sick after being on the cream.

The experience during the 4 months of Aldara treatment was not particularly pleasant: worst of all being that it made the Keratosis lesions much worse in terms of acute redness and inflamation and quite distressing vanity-wise. There was some headaches, some fatigue, but that only lasted 2 weeks or so. After that, no side affects worth bothering about. But I must admit I almost stopped using it during the period of unsightliness. But I didn't. And I am very glad I didn't!  The Dermatologist took me off the Aldara regimen after 4 months and told me to just keep on using the salicylic acid. Now, after 5 months the Keratosis lesions are completely gone, leaving quite smooth new skin. The area is still a little pinkish compared to normal sin colour, but Doctor said that that will disappear once the healing time has done it's work.Over all success I would say.

Doctor put me on antibiotics as I have some infection going on.  Also, using a antibiotic topical cream to help.  It is painful but worth the time going through this as I have heard good results.  I have had the Mohls surgery and also Efudex.  Hope this clears it up for good.",Facetime

A few spots came out.  Now I'm doing my chest area...major sun damage! I'm not going to lie, it itches and burns.  If all these spots are pre-cancer cells, then its definitely worth a few weeks of pain and discomfort! I just told my co-workers what I was doing so I didn't feel the need to ""cover-up"".  Actually feels better not to have clothes rub on it.  I take Advil for the pain.  If only I could go back in time and tell myself to get out of the tanning beds, its not worth it!",Anonymous

I do have an autoimmune disorder (endometriosis and Raynaund's) and the medication has warnings for people with autoimmune disorders so that may be why I am having such an adverse reaction.  Will see doctor tomorrow to learn if I should switch to Efudex maybe but will probably look into the genetic testing for DPD before I start that one.",AblesChapin

One of them is a doctor and this is his statement to me, ""you didn't tell me about the horrible flu symptoms, "" for which I replied, ""you didn't ask.""",Anonymous

Doctor says I need another round to finish off the damage and as a last best hope to avoid having to surgically remove the spot on my nose. I have fair skin and tons of sun damage (including 2nd degree burns over 20% of my body).  My doctor initially recommended that I take 2 months off for the treatment, this time I will take her advice!  I found the treatment too intense to work through due to pain and fatigue.

I have eruptions - red, itchy bumps - but that doesn't bother me as it means the medicines is working and that's exactly what I want.

It's really scary. No real bad side effects other than the swelling and rawness on my chest. Forehead, found 1 AK, appears to be working. I have been experiencing some lower back pain, as I did when I used the Carac Cream. Wondering if this is a side effect or not? I hope this works!
