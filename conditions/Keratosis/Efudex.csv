Don't know what to do now and I am so emotional.  Thank you.,Lowie
1,Efudex,Keratosis,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"October 22, 2021",3,"Have used before under nose with good results- this time use all over face for three weeks dabbing on face twice a day as advised by doc  - but not on forehead- first week not bad - second week really sore and painful - Third week nearly unbearable looked like a monster from the deep face covered in Scabs and peeling skin so so painful to touch a few sleepless nights- rinsing  face with lukewarm water was like putting acid on my face - now 3 weeks after treatment and using a mild steroid cream to help healing boy was it worth it - told by my friends how it actually made my skin look younger and still getting better by the day. So stick with it no pain, no gain in this case never more true - just using good old E45 moisturer to retain my new looks",Dave Smily
2,Efudex,Keratosis,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"October 17, 2021",6,"I’m a 73 year old throat cancer survivor who never wore a hat or sunscreen but loved the beach and golf. I’m paying for that now after just finishing three weeks of Efudix to whole face. It was tough getting through radiation/ chemo with tonsil cancer and this is short of that discomfort but nevertheless challenging with the itching, burning and soreness. Hiding under a hat and mask means I can go out without scaring the children. The biggest problem has been finding relief  as the flaking and scabbing picks up speed in the week after treatment. I tried all of the recommended solutions I found on the net but none really helped me enough to sleep more than an hour or two at a time. In desperation I went to an Amcal chemist and asked for some Famigel which I know works with burning from cancer treatments. He didn’t have any but the pharmacist recommended a cooling, soothing, hydrating gel called Solosite. It worked and I am so so happy now.",ColinK

I didn’t react too badly to start at all. 3rd week in saw big changes as skin became more inflamed but very manageable. I was anxious with all the reviews I read but think it’s important to remind ones that everyone is different. The last day and night after finishing has been the most painful. I’mPutting 1% hydrocortisone on in ointment form. Keeps area oily   Some benefits of COVID are mask wearing. With hat sunnies and mask I can go out and people don’t notice how hideous I look.

8,Efudex,Keratosis,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"May 2, 2020",104,"This is my second time around for using efudex. The first time was 6 years ago. I've grown up on the West coast and spent my summers in the deserts or at the beach. I am of Irish descent, brown hair, blue eyes. By the time I was 60, my face looked terrible. High danger for skin cancer, many trips to dermatologist.Began to hurt significantly on day 14. Everything I read and saw on the web said ""stick it out"". I made it to day 25, Couldn't do another minute.Dragged myself into the doc's office on a Friday afternoon. I looked like Frankenstein. Appt's clerk gasped. Doc said ""Great job. Looks like it was very effective.""That night I washed everything off, and applied Aquaphor. Next two days were most painful. After that, it got better every day, and within two months, there was no trace of the 40 years of sun damage on my face. So...I would give this a 10. I'm a teacher, and did the treatment over the winter holidays. It was all done by January 7",JG

After two further weeks, all of the scabbing has gone and my face has peeled. Still a few weeks to go before the worst of the redness goes.I must be honest - the pain was bad: Burning sensation, needle pricks, scabbing and blood spots on my pillow.Sometimes it was so bad, I had to ease the pain with ice.But all of the pain described above was worth it.The cream detects the worst affected areas - some I had no idea were damaged.It leaves the undamaged skin alone.This cream has reduced my number of visits to the seriously expensive dermatologist to almost zero.My skin feels and looks twenty years younger.I cannot recommend this cream enough, You should be thrilled with the results.But, as with most rewards in life, there is some serious pain involved.",BQ

16,Efudex,Keratosis,10.0,,"October 7, 2017",87,"I was diagnosed with actinic keratosis in August and then decided to apply the Efudex cream to face in the middle of September. I thought that I only had a couple of spots which I was concerned about but after applying the cream to my forehead, temples, cheeks, nose, around the eyes and my ears it became quite apparent that there were a vast amount of areas that had been affected.In the First week I saw that these areas became inflamed although not painful.In the  second week these areas started to merge together and then look like blisters and sores on my face, especially below my eyes.In the third week these started to scab a little and became a bit painful I think due to the skin feeling very dry. I am now in my fourth and final week",Sargie56

18,Efudex,Keratosis,10.0,Taken for 10 years or more,"August 30, 2016",144,"Have used it for pre-cancer on my face probably 6 times since 1996. Using it now on a couple of spots on the back of my hand. Have always found it perfectly effective. Yes, after a couple weeks it begins to look raw and ugly, but that quickly clears up after treatment stops. In every case the spots were cured. Luckily I have never experienced any of the pain or itchiness that others have reported. Perhaps mostly the ones who had problems bothered to report?And I still have the original tube of the produce I got back in 1996, and yes, it still works. There was enough in it to keep me going when needed it and obviously it didn't go bad. The fact it's in a metal tube may have enabled it's long life vs a plastic tube.",Wayne from NS Canada

20,Efudex,Keratosis,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"September 27, 2015",238,"This is the best!!   I've been using it for 4 years and it is absolutely the best solution for AK's.  I am 60 years old, fair skin, been outside for years and developed way too many AK's, not to mention basal and squamous problems too.   For years, the dermatologist only used spot nitrogen and prescribed caramac.     I can only assume she didn't prescribe efudex because she needed the steady income stream from me and my insurance.     By chance I was having a physical from my family doctor.   He asked me when I was going to address my AK;s on forehead.   I told him I did, and he told me he could write me a prescription for medicine that solves it, efudex.  He did and I amazed at the ending results.  Yes, the efudex was painful, looked bad when it was working but results speak for them self",j mack

KNIVES cutting you up in particular. I use and recommend AQUAPHOR instead of the expensive prescribed cortisone cream for a quicker more effective healing process.

I have red hair and fair complexion you can imagine the skin damage I have accumulated in my lifetime. I had used the Efudex 5% cream years ago and had good results. Three months ago I began seeing a dermatologist that recommended the ""new"" technology ""BLUE LIGHT TREATMENTS"". This did NOT work for me gave me a very mild ""sunburn"" with no apparent effect on the former skin damage and it was very expensive even after insurance coverage! I requested my treatment be changed to the proven Efudex my doctor insisted I stay with the ""blue light"", that my skin was ""in very good condition"" and that I only needed ""maintenance"".As you may guess I have changed physicians and now I am being treated with Efudex again. My skin is now in full reaction after only two weeks treatment with Efudex.

Side effects are bad: breaking out looks unsightly, itching makes you feel like you want to scratch off your skin. The best relief I have found is Tylenol for pain and Calendula Cream (Marigold Cream) for the relief of irritated skin.  That's keeping me sane and I am on week 4 overall: 16 days using medication the remainder trying to overcome side effects.  Good luck to everyone.  I still have more to go....",froghopper1

The only relief I have found so far is Tylenol, Extra Strength and Aquaphor once everything has been pulled to the surface.  Of course keeping the affected areas uncovered is a huge help.  I sleep on a beach towel over my sheets so the shedding and peeling are ""contained"".  It's the only way I don't itch throughout the night and even if I do, the roughness of the towel helps to get it off the skin.  Hope this helps. ",Anonymous
