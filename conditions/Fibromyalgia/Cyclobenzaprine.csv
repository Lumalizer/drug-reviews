1,Cyclobenzaprine,Fibromyalgia,9.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"September 26, 2020",5,"The secret to Cyclobenzaprine working is multiple, rapid dosing. The magic lies in the long, strong half life.I typically start with 20mgs and 30-45 minutes later take another 10mgs. And possibly another 10mgs within an hour after that. I've never needed more than that in a session, or couldn't stay awake to take more anyhow.In only the most severe instance did I do another session about 16 hours later, and it was the initial 20mgs followed by another 10mgs.I find it pairs with ibuprofen or naproxen effectively.I notice a good mood for a few days after using and have experimented with 10mgs as a nightly routine against depression with outstanding results.It can bring down bad trips, and using the pain session dosing works a million times better for my anxiety if I feel an attack coming on, like before dental work appointments, than Valium ever did.",Kat

3,Cyclobenzaprine,Fibromyalgia,8.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"March 14, 2020",33,Stated taking cyclobenzaprine at a dose 5mg about 3 weeks ago for Fibro. Huge improvement. I'm back to playing pool and on the treadmill every 2nd day instead of being laid up and taking it easy for 2-3 days or longer. Showed the physical activity data from my phone to my doctor. He was sold on it. I am too. I've had 3 heart attacks (familial cholestemia) genetics. I need to be more active. Yeah I'm pleased with the reduction in my pain 30-50%. Still there but way more manageable and my mental health has definitely swung to a more happier outlook.,Mondavino

7,Cyclobenzaprine,Fibromyalgia,10.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"October 3, 2018",26,"After trying a bunch of medications over the course of a couple years, I found the Chronic Pain & Fatigue Research center I've been on gapapentin, pregabalin, hydrocodone, methotrexate, doxepin, high levels of NSAIDs, SNRIs, SSRIs, etc, but nothing has been as effective as Dr recommendation of Flexeril (cyclobenzaprine) 5mg/daily.It has relatively few side effects out of drugs I've tried for fibro. If you're not getting the results you'd like, work with your physician to get off opiates and try this, or one of the others Dr. Clauw references in his talks.It has seriously saved my quality of life.",hubble

She also gave me Flexeril to see if it would help as it has been helpful for others.  However, it was not for me.  I noticed that I was very drowsy all the time and it interacted with my other meds.  The major downside was it did nothing to relieve the pain from fibromyalgia, either, which was confirmed by a diagnosis from the rheumatologist.",MissLeopard83
11,Cyclobenzaprine,Fibromyalgia,9.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"May 15, 2018",12,After years of muscle tightness spasms and horrific pain I was finally diagnosed with fibro. The condition of muscle tightness had me on flexaril first.  The condition always returns after meds ran out.  With FM diagnosis came Cymbalta.  Which helped some.  The magic was lyrica and flexaril.  I can function semi normal if I don't over do things I can stay pain free (although the pain is still there a missed dose of all my meds showed me this).  Flexaril has helped me so much and I am ever so grateful for the semi normal life.  Medicines wear off on me and stop working after a while so I pretty much have to switch every few months.Honestly I don't mind switching every few months.  I did at first.,Akchick

It's so nice to finally have some days where I do not wake up in debilitating pain, after a night of tossing and turning! I do not notice any side effects except for constipation, but I have IBS-C anyway so it's nothing new to me. If you have a lot of fibromyalgic or rheumatic pain, this is definitely worth a try.

A couple years ago I had another neurological pain condition develop that required me to take muscle relaxers during the day as well too. So I was put on a lighter weight (baclofen) muscle relaxer for during the day and to replace this at night. Within a few days of going off of this, I was so stiff I could barely walk. I ended up back on this for my evening dose, and within a couple days I was back to normal activity. So for me at least, this has worked better then anything.",MereRock
