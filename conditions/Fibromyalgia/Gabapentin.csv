1,Gabapentin,Fibromyalgia,4.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"November 28, 2021",0,"I had severe hip pain that started radiating towards my upper body & legs, I went to the ER which ultimately led me to a new primary care provider. Doing blood work, X-rays, going through steroids & different medicines with no change in my pain (which was increasing). They eventually put me on gabapentin 100mg for 3/4 times a day which only made me drowsy, I still felt intense pain. They then put me up to 300mg which still made no difference for me. So now I only use it at night if I can’t sleep due to pain.",miss.jade13

But I have had no problem with my mood on Gabapentin!Gabapentin does cause me severe drowsiness, and it is hard to focus.I take 300mg Gabapentin 3x a day, with 250mg Naproxen 2x a day. As it's not strong enough alone.It really only starts to work for severe pain at 900mg a day!Its not on the PBS in Australia, but it is affordable.For comparison, I used to take 300mg of Tramadol a day, but changed to Gabapentin because I grew tolerant to Tramadol.

It was hard to shower, clean, do laundry or cook.This medication has brought my pain down from 8 to a 3!Side effects were tolerable.

I started Gabapentin 2 days ago and wow I have been up and out of my bed!!  Doctor said to take it at night but no way....it would keep me up with the energy I have.

9,Gabapentin,Fibromyalgia,3.0,,"March 6, 2021",1,"2 years ago, I got sick and never got better. I describe it as having a 50% flu all the time. I still don't have a diagnosis, but tentatively fibromyalgia for now. My labs indicate scleroderma but no clinical signs. The fatigue used to trump any other complaint, but recently the pain in my knuckles even beats the fatigue. Dr. Prescribed this drug, up to 1800 mg a day in three divided doses. At first, I thought this was a miracle drug, I felt better, slept better, side effects minimal. My only complaint was DO NOT MIX THIS WITH THC. I got so dizzy, had to crawl to bed. Fast forward a month, and have started obsessing about suicide. I will sit in the bath and plan my notes and method. Till it dawned on me that it had to be the gabapentin. I did some research and yes, it's a serious side effect. Also, I've violently lashed out at my boyfriend.

It should be taken off the market.  Since there is all this hype about opioid abuse it seems ""gabapentin"" has become the ""go to med"" by doctors.

In my mind I see myself doing so many things I did in my past but when it comes to try to do them I just can't.  The constant pain never goes away.

15,Gabapentin,Fibromyalgia,6.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"November 20, 2019",15,Has helped brain fog a bit. I started taking gabapentin about 3 weeks ago for fibromyalgia. I started at 100mgs per my primary dr. That did nothing! Then I went to pain management dr who said at least 900mgs is needed been any benefit is usually seen. So I went up to 300mgs at bedtime. Nothing. Might as well be taking sugar pill. Then 300mgs morning and night (600mgs per day). No change. Now 300 mgs 3 times per day (900mgs total per day) and my pain is not any better but I am able to focus a little more.

I've tried other medications for Fibro and this has been the most useful so far. I'd say it gets rid of 30-40% of my Fibro-derived pain, and it helps immensely with mental fog, anxiety, and fatigue.

Oh! and anxiety! Gabapentin helped with all of that. Only problem I had with Gabapentin is it made me hypomanic (then I heard stuff that wasn't there, got angry all the time etc.) before the drug went about destroying my memory and making my hands swell.

I now take 3600mg of gabapentin daily. 1200mg three times daily. It works great. I started out with a much lower dose and as the fibro got worse the dosage increased.

I was prescribed Gaba 100mg at first for nerve pain in my legs I started experiencing after surgery.  My doctor said Gaba should help and diagnosed me with Fibromyalgia at the time.  She said for me to get into a neurologist and see what was going on.  I took it as directed for a month, and it never helped one bit.  She then raised it to 300mg, and still nothing.  I just stopped taking it because it didn't do anything.    I just went to a spine specialist and was prescribed Gaba 300 mg again.  Once again, nothing.  It doesn't do anything for me at all.  I'm also taking Ultram, and it isn't helping.  I have another appointment in a month to get surgery done for my ruptured disc.  I guess he put me on both meds to handle the pain until then.  I still have to get into a neurologist for the nerve pain issues that I've had since my last surgery.   I had to put that on hold because of my back issue.",Anonymous

It took my fibromyalgia pain away almost instantly. I had more energy because I slept better with no pain. For me my brain worked better, I had no brain fog.

24,Gabapentin,Fibromyalgia,10.0,,"January 15, 2019",47,"Initially I started Lyrica which made fibromyalgia pain worse. Specifically the vastus medialis muscles above the knee cap. Ditched Lyrica for gabapentin. Take 600 mg morning & noon, 900 mg at night. The pharmacy supplies 300 mg capsules which I take 30-60 minutes apart. Raises the bioavailability for major symptom relief. This drug is poorly absorbed at high doses. 3x dose is not equal to 3x more absorbed by the body. Also take baclofen 10 mg X 2 /day This combo relaxes muscles , helps shut down my brain and induce sleep. Also migraine frequency is reduced from 10-12/month down to 1-2/ month. Miss a dose and it's so bad . Virtually guaranteed a migraine and certainly fibromyalgia pain increase. Side effects on GABA are brain slowness.

After taking my first pill at bed time, I noticed that my legs felt odd. They were sort of warm. It was more like a calming sensation than anything else. That's when I realized that I wasn't in pain. After one 300 mg pill, I was relatively pain free 20-30 minutes after. I was shocked! I kept hopping out of the bed to walk around, do squats, etc., because I was so amazed by the lack of pain.

Be careful with ambitious dosing, 300 mg at a time really is enough, one too many pills in doctor dosing trials put me right back in a fog. Legs & arms no longer have ""pins and needles,"" my body parts ""fall asleep"" significantly less, and that sense of widespread nerve pain has diminished.

I have done the rigamarole of drugs for pain and sleep...spent years running on 2 hours sleep here and there and unable to function normally.  Tramadol used to provide adequate pain relief but my insurance stopped covering it and I could not afford it after that.  Muscle relaxants helped for a while but over time they became less helpful.  Eventually I stopped taking them.  Recently my doctor put me on Gabapentin and for the first time in years I got some real sleep and my pain is dulled to a low roar.
