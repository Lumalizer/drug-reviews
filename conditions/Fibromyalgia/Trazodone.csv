0,Trazodone,Fibromyalgia,10.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"March 20, 2019",43,"Trazadone has given me a much improved life with fibromyalgia. [I have to say Wow, Yay, and Wahoo!] My fibromyalgia was diagnosed over 25 years ago (not widely recognized as a legitimate medical condition back then). Also, I had back injuries during gov employment.  Because of both, I took ibuprofen 600-1200mg and Acetaminophen 1500mg Daily to function normally. Post-bariatric surgery I couldn't take NSAIDs. For the dual pain control, 15 yrs ago I was prescribed NORCO 3/25mg daily (after 5 yrs increased to 3/50mg) AS NEEDED (still fits my pain management needs)▶️Depression increased >Venlafaxine ER 300mg/day. Anxiety increased> Xanax .25mg x2 daily AS NEEDED. Chronic Insomnia > OTC sleep aids ineffective (2hrs - 6hrs very interrupted) One month ago my doctor prescribed, at bedtime, Trazadone 50mg to increase to 200mg.  Now, 100 mg/1 hr before sleep is the dose. Depression gone  - sun's shining. Anxiety - Much Less. Insomnia - sleep 6-8 hrs, no grogginess.  Pain Levels - same, but more psychologically manageable.",gap1
1,Trazodone,Fibromyalgia,8.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"February 24, 2019",28,I get MUCH better sleep only since and I've bee  taking Trazodone. Good sleep is essential in my overall ability to stay above debilitating pain. I'm very thankful for this medication.,Danybanany
2,Trazodone,Fibromyalgia,,Taken for 10 years or more,"February 23, 2019",48,"I have been using trazodone for about 21 years. I take 50mg every night. I have chronic pain from fibromyalgia. If I don’t sleep that pain is worse, much worse. Trazodone gets me below the pain so I can get to sleep. Does it act like a pain killer? No, but getting sleep does.",Brin

4,Trazodone,Fibromyalgia,9.0,,"September 19, 2017",23,"I have been newly diagnosed with a moderate fibromyalgia. Not getting enough sleep and waking up with severe pain when trying to sleep. My doctor started me with 50 MG of trazodone taking 1/2 tablet at bedtime. This is the first week and it's working well. My sleep has increased to 6-8 hours as recommended  by MD. At the onset of the pain it has subsided quickly. I am a busy healthcare professional , I exercise daily and drink plenty of fluids. It  was also recommended that I go to counselling because I have a lot of personal related stress.",Dinky60

6,Trazodone,Fibromyalgia,10.0,Taken for 5 to 10 years,"February 8, 2017",56,"Some reviewers are commenting Trazodone ""does nothing"" for their fibromyalgia and only helps them sleep.  Yet, insomnia is a HUGE part of the illness!  For me, pain is the most crucial factor keeping me from sleeping.  However, I find that when I sleep, I have a much better day afterwards-- usually with less pain.  [It's a cycle.]  I look forward to my quality of life continuing to improve.  I have used a much lower dose of Trazodone in the past, and it worked excellently for sleep.  This time, I've had to take 150 mgs (plus muscle relaxers sometimes).  I need and plan for 10 hours of sleep.  Sometimes I wake up feeling great.  When I awaken groggy, it wears off after awhile and is usually because I didn't go to bed early enough.",Fibromyalgia/ Insomnia

8,Trazodone,Fibromyalgia,9.0,,"September 5, 2016",59,"I have fibromyalgia and chronic insomnia. I began taking Trazadone for chronic insomnia of about 7 years. I tried every med out there to get even 3 to 4 hrs a night. I started on 50 mgs at bedtime and it did nothing. So I then took 100 mgs a night and would sleep 3-4 hours and then wake up. My doctor added Lunesta 3 mgs to take with the Trazodone and I sleep all night every night for the first time in at least 7 years. I had tried Lunesta a few years back and it did not work for me at all, but taken along with Trazodone I get a peaceful sleep all night long. I also take Cymbalta and Gabapentin for my Fibro and my life is pretty good. Still get fibro flares every so often but nothing like I used to get when first diagnosed 14 years ago.",Robin1650
9,Trazodone,Fibromyalgia,3.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"July 6, 2016",41,"I started Trazadone 2 weeks ago and have had major side effects to the point I had to stop it!  Severe muscle and joint pain, fibromyalgia (hurting everywhere on body), severe headaches, serious memory loss, dry eyes and sinus congestion, vivid dreams,dizziness, blurred vision!  I stopped it yesterday and now everything has significantly improved, thank God!!  I know this drug effects everyone differenty, but my husband tried it for his insomnia as well and he had the SAME symptoms.  We both feel much better now.....hope this was helpful.  I was taking 50mg and tried 100mg a couple times....Symptoms were getting worse each day.",Pumpkinfields
10,Trazodone,Fibromyalgia,9.0,Taken for 10 years or more,"May 25, 2016",36,"This medicine helps me get my r.e.m. sleep, which fibromyalgia robs me up. Fibro and chronic fatigue syndrome often go hand in hand. It can be the direct result of lack of r.e.m. sleep.",Red Molly
11,Trazodone,Fibromyalgia,5.0,,"November 22, 2015",47,"Desyrel (trazodone):This medication does not do anything for my fibromyalgia pain, it does lessen anxiety and treats insomnia. I was given six different sleep meds, none of the them worked. My sleep study showed 15 minutes as the longest period of of sleep that night. I went 6 days with only 2 hours on night 3. I thought I was going crazy. I can't explain how it feels to go that long without sleep. This medication was the one that finally knocked me out and kept me out.  The problem is I sleep too long when I take it. The have fibromyalgia & multiple disc issues and bursitis in my hips.  if I do not turn over frequently my back and hip pain increase radically. I slept like I was in a coma for 8 hours.  I only take when sleep is more important than pain relief",Kristy 1633
12,Trazodone,Fibromyalgia,10.0,Taken for 5 to 10 years,"September 17, 2015",59,"I have been on Trazodone for over 7 years.  My doctor precribed this to me to help me get a good nights sleep because my fibro wouldn't let me sleep through the night.  It isn't intended to help with fibro pain, just to help fall asleep and stay asleep.  I have had to up the dosage over the years but I have no major side effects, except dry mouth.  I can't possibly sleep without it.  I also figured out that if I work out (my fibro is in my shoulders and neck) and exhaust those muscles so that they are too tired to burn, my symptoms are kept a bay.",Anonymous

When my doctor suggested I try trazadone I was skeptical. Now I never want to be without it. It has done wonders for my sleep and the quality of my sleep. No grogginess or trouble waking up. I would recommend it for those that have trouble both getting to sleep and staying asleep.,lovscrttrs

18,Trazodone,Fibromyalgia,8.0,,"June 2, 2013",36,Great for getting a good nights sleep without the hangover feeling the next day. Tried to stop taking it and had terrible withdrawals and didn't sleep for 3 nights. Will not try that again! Doesn't do much for the pain.,Jess0908
19,Trazodone,Fibromyalgia,10.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"January 4, 2013",33,"I started taking Trazodone in combination with Seroquel about a year ago for chronic insomnia.  I had become addicted to hypnotic sleep aids and needed to change medicines.  A dosage of 200mg in conjunction with 150mg of Seroquel enables me to get uninterrupted sleep.

I started at 50 mg/night and gradually over the 12 years got up to 150 mg.My one problem with it had been an addictive appetite for sugar, which has now gone away completely by taking Pristiq as my anti-depressant! When I cut the dose in half, I got terrible fibromyalgia back. It also greatly helps my sleep.",sara12345
22,Trazodone,Fibromyalgia,6.0,,"October 13, 2011",36,I've been taking trazadone for the past year to help me sleep. I get anxious when I go to bed because I'm afraid I won't sleep well and I have to because I also have fibromyalgia. I'm taking 150 mg now. If I take 200mg I can barely wake up and am hung over all day. I take 50mg about 30 mins before bed and the other 100mg right before. I do this because it sometimes makes me feel weird and nauseous if I take it all at once. It does nothing for my pain. Just helps me sleep and relaxes me at night. It's good for now.,Anonymous
23,Trazodone,Fibromyalgia,4.0,,"November 11, 2010",28,"I take this when my insomnia gets very bad, because it helps me not wake up every few hours. However, I've found that it makes my fibromyalgia pain much worse the next morning, so I only use it as a last resort.",Anonymous

27,Trazodone,Fibromyalgia,10.0,,"January 1, 2010",20,I began taking trazadone 20 years ago for depression and insomnia. It has working very well for all these years. Unfortunately I have myalgias and began taking tramadol for pain this last year. I have had a rare reaction called serotonin syndrome. I can't move without the pain control medicines so I've had to give up my faithful trazadone.,sabsteak

32,Trazodone,Fibromyalgia,8.0,,"August 8, 2009",24,"I've been on every anti-depressant, preventative migraine drug, and odd and sundry 'experiments' for fibromyaligia in many years. As a long time insomniac, I tried Trazodone. The dose necessary for sleep is too much for me. I feel groggy and drop off to sleep the next day. However, if I take half of a dose with an anti-anxiety medicine, I'll sleep. The truly wonderful discovery is that for the first time, I rarely have the really bad and impossible to exorcise migraines I've had since childhood, now that I'm taking the modest dose of Trazodone! Often, they can be knocked out with a prescription painkiller, and only rarely do I need to resort to the Imitrex 'family' to rid myself of them! My doctor is surprised, but it's surely worth a try!",catzilla
