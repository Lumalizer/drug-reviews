1,Duloxetine,Fibromyalgia,5.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"March 3, 2022",1,"Cymbalta (duloxetine):Cymbalta is simultaneously the most wonderful medication I’ve ever taken and the most horrifying. I have ankylosing spondylitis, severe lower back/hip pain, generalized anxiety, social anxiety and was just diagnosed with fibromyalgia.  My doctor recommended we try Cymbalta first. The good: absolutely amazing muscle and nerve pain relief.  Cured my anxiety. I cannot tell you how many genuine laughs and smiles I had in the three months I was on Cymbalta. I felt like I was living the life I was always meant to live.  Started looking into rejoining the workforce after three yearsThe not so good: unrelenting insomnia no matter what time of day I took it, and even going to a lower dose.  Did not sleep more than three hours a night for three months.  The first week, I had LOUD suicidal thoughts, I ignored because I enjoyed the benefits of the medication so much.  Then came nighttime and daytime hallucinations. I saw, heard and felt things that did not exist.",Aimee
2,Duloxetine,Fibromyalgia,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"March 2, 2022",0,"Cymbalta (duloxetine):I was actually prescribed this for fibromyalgia and depression, but I could only choose one option up there. So, when my doctor told me about this medicine, I wanted this to work SO badly; I was so excited! I took it for almost 2 weeks, and I KNOW that you have to give time for it to truly work, but I could not do it with this. I was so incredibly sick to my stomach, it was interfering with my life. I am a 25 y/o woman who fully supports herself & goes to class part time, I do not have time to be leaving work & missing my classes because of extreme nausea and vomiting. I thought at first maybe I had just caught a stomach virus, but it kept happening. I tried taking it with food, right before eating, right after eating, even 30 min to an hour after eating and I was still sick. I called my doctor and told her about this and she told me to stop. The sickness stopped the next day, too. So I know it was the cymbalta. Don’t let this scare you, Everyone is different, this was just my experience.",Anonymous

4,Duloxetine,Fibromyalgia,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"January 30, 2022",1,"Cymbalta (duloxetine):My doctor has been treating me for fairly severe osteoarthritis pain for several years. The pain, along with fibromyalgia pain, is gradually increasing. I’ve been on Celebrex and Plaquenil for a few years and they’ve helped. Recently my doctor also prescribed Cymbalta, starting at 20mg first week, 40 mg 2nd week. The first week was difficult. A sensation I described as ants running along my nervous system made me feel very uncomfortable and I felt this along my spine and down my arms and legs. I’ve never felt that before. I had insomnia and got 2 hours of sleep each night. Anxiety and the feeling that my muscles were tight or in knots, for lack of a better description, especially in my abdomen and pelvic area, this was my worst symptom. Also, I had to urinate frequently , a few nights at least 10-15 times. Nausea was very bad the first week. The second week my dose doubled and I have been miserable.",Silver Moon

I couldn’t get out of bed slept for 48 hours. 3rd day upon awakening I said nope. It did reset my appetite to zero though- a good side effect. I lost 5 pounds from those days of not eating and I seem to no longer care for food The way I did before. I’m happy about that because I seriously need to lose about 10 lbs.,Kim

If it weren't for this, I'd be homeless or dead. I find that I'm not overthinking absolutely every aspect of my life. I'm able to sometimes actually think - and most importantly, I'm not overridden by suicidal thoughts. Another reason I was prescribed this medication is for fibromyalgia - which has gotten better. Keep in mind that for pain, it took me 2 months to start feeling any results in that department and of course the pain is still there - just minimally. I think it's definitely way more manageable than before, and sometimes I don't even notice it unless I start thinking about it. I'm just so happy with this medication, I've experienced absolutely no side effects at all, and I'm able to make jokes and smile for the first time in over a decade. I can start conversation without only complaining, and I'm able to live again.",boop

I've had fibromyalgia for 4 years but last few months have been excruciating. I work full time and have to usually take tylenol and ibuprofen/aleve just to make it through. I have been taking cymbalta now for a week. I take it at night with a meal and get a slight headache and dizziness sometimes. It does subside pretty quickly. I must say I have felt better this last week than I have in a long time. Give this a chance it really does help!,Katie

The side effects in the beginning were awful but I stuck with it. Cymbalta did help with my fibromyalgia symptoms but I did not realize what was going to happen in the long term. Cymbalta caused me to become a compulsive gambler.  For years,  I gambled and at times I was in the Casino everyday.  Gambling was all I could think of. It almost caused the loss of my marriage. Not to mention thousands and thousands of dollars. I finally could not do it anymore. When I researched the correlation between Cymbalta and gambling, I found studies that actually showed the side effect most in middle aged women. I decided to stop cold turkey, I DO NOT RECOMMEND DOING THAT. Nevertheless, incredibly I stopped Cymbalta and the urge to gamble went away.I now suffer with pain again everyday but no gambling. My marriage and finances have improved but my pain is no way to live. Need advice.",VMWHITE13

It’s the only health condition I have besides minor bulging disc and ddd in my lower back that mostly doesn’t cause people pain, and 45lbs overweight. I will update as I keep taking it, but honestly I’m holding on to cymbalta and wellbutrin for dear life as long as it works. IDC if I never come off it. I’m working on getting back to work and believing in myself again.Side effects so far are constipation and sweating like I got rained on.

Mostly nausea, headaches and dizziness. Nausea was worst one so took another rx to help with that. I really gave it a go but after 6 weeks I couldn’t take it anymore. Side effects were too much for me. I’m now weaning off of it and am very dizzy even if I sit. Unfortunately I didn’t notice any positive results.",Nat

With yelate I do not experience gastric irritation and nausea.  Fibromyalgia is very difficult to deal with and manage as it is a syndrome so I deal with pain, insomnia, depression, brain fog all the works, what I noted was that it would make me lose focus and be teary and irritable most of the time it was not effective at all I have been on the 60mg dose 30mg is useless for me so since 3 days ago as I had lost hope I decided to increase the dose to 120mg and am feeling much much much better so I will carry on and see.",MN from South Africa

The tiredness come out of nowhere I crashed into the divider I was okay the car was not. Thank goodness I was in a truck. There needs to be a stronger warning on Cymbalta.

I had a lot of side effects at first, but assumed it was part of the initial adjustment. Weirdly the first week it felt like I was developing narcolepsy as I was literally just falling asleep, this effect faded though. A month or so in realized that the symptoms  I have been having got WAY worse after 1-2 drinks then proceeded to lessen up over the next couple days. Cue the realization that many of my symptoms line up with mind to moderate serotonin toxicity... yep. So dropped it and oh my goodness apparently it had been doing wonders for pain!Talked to my doc, we decided to try it again but dropping the bupropion. Much better in general, but still felt like it just turned my brain off. Not brain fog, but an encompassing blankness and emptiness. I was non functional and not present. I ended up having to drop it again. It effects on pain were outstanding, but I prefer the pain to that awful blankness.",Pixie

It has been a life changer.Side effects:  I was prescribed sublingual medication to treat the nausea I experienced early on. I do feel a but like I shake/vibrate at my current I experienced  some shaking in hands and could no longer play piano. A rare side effect I am told.  Regardless of some small side effects at my current dose, this medication allows me to be more functional and not spend my days in bed, crying and being in a lot of pain.",Lino
23,Duloxetine,Fibromyalgia,9.0,,"December 31, 2020",7,Cymbalta (duloxetine):I put off taking this drug due to all the negative comments. I have had bad reactions and very sensitive to most other medications and this was literally my last resort. I was petrified as I hate nausea and vomiting (a lot of people commented on this as a side effect). I take Tixol brand. I suffer from deliberating anxiety and fibromyalgia. I have been on 30 mg for approx 7 weeks and about to up my dose tomorrow. On other antidepressants it has taken me about 10 days to actually half function again. On duloxetine I felt a little dizzy and blurred vision for 2-3 days and then I felt normal. The only side effect I’ve had is hair loss and brittle hair. It has alleviated mostly all my elbow pain from fibromyalgia which was crippling pain and anxiety is much better. This worked quite quickly. It’s a relief to not have ice packs strapped to my arms every night and tears that silently run down my face from the pain. If it wasn’t for hair loss this would be a 10/10 for me.,Fibro girl

To my surprise it works great and the side effects are not bad for me at all. The first 2 weeks, I felt unlike myself (a little on edge and runny nose, and insomnia) but that all faded at about 1.5 weeks. After that nothing really... but wow it works. Took the pain down from about 7/8 to about 3/4 on the pain scale. And that is only at the 30mg lowest dose. I am sure I could go up to 60 mg like my doctor recommended, but I would rather keep it minimal and deal with the remaining low level of pain.  And I have missed a dose and didn't recognize anything abnormal like the ""zaps"" everyone talks about on here.  I will update this review if anything changes, because I realize its just as important to read the good reviews, especially when you are worried to try a new medicine.",KM

I had never had a panic attack in my life until taking this medicine. I took the pill at 10:30am. At 12:30 I couldn’t catch my breath. My heart started pounding. My vision became a tunnel and I felt like I was about to pass out. The only thing I could do was lay down and breathe deeply. Things calmed down, I get up from the bed and wham! It hit me again. This time however my skin started burning. My chest and arms felt like they were on fire. I couldn’t breathe again, my vision went tunnel like again. Ringing ears, pounding heart. Even my feet started itching really bad.  The panic attacks were severe. The ER told me I had to let the medicine run its course and they gave me a xanax to help calm the panic attacks. It took 18 hours. The xanax helped. It was the Worst day and night of my life! The doctor said my reaction was not a normal reaction.

Over the course of two days without the drug I'd get so bound up that I was basically incapable of functioning -- stretching, yoga, meditation, and other meds helped. With Cymbalta, I'd be tight but the tightness wouldn't continue to constrict and spread throughout my body -- I could function with mild stretching/acupressure rather than being disabled without excessive stretching/acupressure.

I would say this medication has decreased my muscle pain by about 50 to 75% depending on the day. It has also helped with arthritis pain in my hips and back.

Sickness, constantly sleeping all day; no appetite, rash, dizziness, nausea, constant headaches, not sleeping at all at night and struggling to move are just to name a few but once you get past that, they’re better than any pain killer.
