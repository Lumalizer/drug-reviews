0,5-hydroxytryptophan,Fibromyalgia,10,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"December 25, 2016",15,100mg of 5 HTP has been very effective for my insomnia and Fibro. I combine it with an edible of THC/ melatonin. I have been doing this for 4 months and feel much better. It's not the magic bullet but better than prescription drugs. I was taking Norco and Valium.,Madalaine
1,5-hydroxytryptophan,Fibromyalgia,9,,"January 29, 2016",27,"5-HTP is a really effective all-natural supplement for combatting symptoms of Fibromyalgia - among many other things. It naturally increases serotonin levels which help with sleep quality, pain reduction and depression. ",a20030
2,5-hydroxytryptophan,Fibromyalgia,8,,"March 26, 2015",21,"Ive been taking 200mg a day for the past 2 weeks. I definitely can tell a difference in my mood. It has seemed to help my pain some but not completely. I do sleep better, but I find myself going into these deep pockets of sleep then wake up, then drift back, and some of the dreams are pretty vivid. I'll continue taking this, it couldnt hurt, I just dont want to take any of the other RX drugs on the market because of the side effects.",Artfull
3,5-hydroxytryptophan,Fibromyalgia,8,Taken for 10 years or more,"February 3, 2013",90,"5-HTP (5-hydroxytryptophan):I took 5HTP for about 10 years and it kept my Fibromyalgia pain in control enough that I could work 40 to 60 hours a week again without discomfort.  Unfortunately, my family doctor had me stop taking it when my blood pressure became dangerously high.  I would recommend you try it, but keep a close watch on your blood pressure.",Bug25
