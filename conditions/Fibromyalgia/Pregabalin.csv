1,Pregabalin,Fibromyalgia,10.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"February 6, 2022",1,"Words cannot express how thankful I am to finally get some relief from my fibromyalgia and trigeminal neuralgia! I had no issues with Lyrica and no noticeable side effects. Don't listen to other people's horror stories about this drug until you try it yourself. Everyone has different experiences with starting a new medication. My neurologist slowly increased the dose and I'm at a maintenance dose of 300 mg a day. The aches and pains have decreased by 80 percent! I can sleep more comfortably now too without my body throbbing at night. Lyrica has been a useful adjunct in addition to the other meds I take for pain such as Robaxin, Celebrex, and Valium. I also have mixed connective tissue disease so I know what kind of nightmare chronic pain brings daily. This is not a scary drug.",bmcadams95

3,Pregabalin,Fibromyalgia,1.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"December 30, 2021",0,"I was prescribed this drug for fibromyalgia, ended up being prescribed the highest dose as my body kept getting used to it.  I went to a pain clinic they told me lyrica is no longer working and to come off it.  I dropped 25mg every now and then.  I decided to go into rehab as I had spoken to them for a month claiming they could help me get off the drug.  The doctor took me off 25mg every other day I stopped when I was on 75mg.  This was Oct - Nov 2019 in December 2019 I had my first seizure I have since had 18 more seizures and 2 Absence seizures, I also ended up suffering anxiety, suicidal thoughts, depression, chills, sweats and loud tinnitus none I had before this drug.  Been completely off for 19 months and still suffering withdrawals.  This is a seizure drug not a pain drug.",Jazz
4,Pregabalin,Fibromyalgia,1.0,Taken for 10 years or more,"October 28, 2021",0,"Lyrica (pregabalin):Took 100 mg Lyrica over 10 years for Fibromyalgia. Definitely helped with pain in the beginning but side effects were not worth it in the end. Gained 50+ lbs from when I began meds and when I stopped.  Severe swelling of feet, hands, brain fog, memory loss & speech/language flow change. After being off Lyrica for 1+ year I have a hard time remembering something I was about to say 2 seconds ago. I forget simple words like coffee, bicycle, elevator & can't think of them till I describe what I am thinking of to my kids & they look at me like I have 10 heads when they figure out what I am trying to say. After taking meds for 10+ yrs once I stopped the immediate difference in my brain fog was night & day. Although I can't prove it I know my memory & language capabilities will never be the same but I never realized how much brain fog the drug was causing until I stopped taking it. Please listen & just manage the pain - because memory & language issues are not something you can recover.",Concordmom

7,Pregabalin,Fibromyalgia,8.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"September 18, 2021",2,"This medicine is good. I can sleep, It helps with my pain at night. Unfortunately; I am very sensitive with medicines and with 150 mg I feel a little bit high and dizzy but 0 pain, so I take 100mg at night because I like to feel more in control but still I can sleep and helps with pain. Also, I notice it helps with  my GAD, I feel calm and without irritability. I have peripheral neuropathy in my arms and it helps as well with it. I don't like the fact that I need to take medicine but, it is what it is and so far It has been the only medicine that take away the pain. I also take duloxetine 20 mg not sure yet if it is worth it and Ultracet when I need it because I don’t take pregabalin during the day because makes me sleepy and I can’t think clearly and I need to work.

8,Pregabalin,Fibromyalgia,1.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"September 5, 2021",1,"Lyrica (pregabalin):I have Fibromyalgia & Rheumatoid Arthritis. In the beginning I thought Lyrica was amazing. My pain was gone & I was moving. I was happy. Half way through the second month I started noticing I was dealing with fibro fog much more than before. It was worse than before & continued getting progressively worse. I couldn't put words together, I sometimes forgot where I was driving to & why I was going. At the time I was 42 years old. That should not be happening.  Along with that some of the pain was back & getting worse. I couldn't keep my eyes open. In the first three months of taking Lyrica I gained almost 40 pounds which made the pain worse. I stayed in contact with my doctor & finally she took me off of Lyrica. The severe fibro fog calmed & any fog experience after coming off was minor. The weight started going down & I started feeling like me again. I will never take Lyrica again. It was a horrible experience. Never again",Sheila

Had to be seated and let someone put my new grandson in my arms. My doctors and I tried a lot of things. The medicine that got me back to more normal activity was Lyrica. I took it for all of 2014, and haven't needed it again until now, August 2021. Yes, I have had fibro all my life, but there are degrees of muscular pain and stiffness, and painful joints.

I returned to the drug in 2021 at a lower dose than before but it now makes me feel like I am drunk, running into walls, tripping over my own feet, feeling stoned.  All other drugs I take have not changed, so it would not be a drug interaction.  My doctor and I are unable to discover why my reaction should have changed, especially at a lower dose.  We're working at getting me the correct dose.",Barb
14,Pregabalin,Fibromyalgia,1.0,,"July 14, 2021",4,"Lyrica (pregabalin):I have wondered why they Lyrica commercials stopped being shown on tv.  The only good thing about it was informing the public about the terrible and awful condition called fibromyalgia.  I've had fibro for many years now.  I was put on a lot of meds.  Lyrics was just horrible.  I was in my mid 40's when diagnosed and after seeing about 5000 doctors.   I would kick my poor husband during my sleep...if I could get to sleep.  Muscle jerks, weakness all over and the worst of all I would wet the bed almost every night!  That stopped after I threw the Lyrica in the trash can!  .  There is definitely a place for opioids in this world.  People in hideous, chronic pain are careful users.  I am a pill counter.  I do NOT want to run out before the refill date!  I highly recommend a pain specialist.   My oldest, dearest friend has fibro too.  We both started teaching in a small, private school which we now believe had mold. Five women have fibro that worked there.",Mrs. T
15,Pregabalin,Fibromyalgia,10.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"April 5, 2021",4,"I started Pregabalin couple years ago for my back pain. I take Celebrex with it too. Since the first day I took it I found that I know longer needed opioid pain relievers. I also have had bad anxiety problems my adult life. And didn't know that it was going to solve that problem as well. And some people I've heard saying it's no different the gabapentin. Well to me  it is a lot different that gabapentin, at least for my situation. It can cause weight gain and a couple other minor side effects. If anyone has any condition that involves pain, anxiety, etc..I really highly suggest you try Pregabalin. There is a generic form of this now but the name others might know it as lyrica. And most insurance cover it as well. So I suggest if it sounds like a possible treatment for you, that have a talk with your Dr. and try pregabalin. It has really saved me.",J

I have been diagnosed with dysthymia and have had a couple of major depressive disorders - chronic back pain which I asked for more review of for over 10 years and finally got a doctor to take an x-ray and have levoscoliosis and arthritis in my spine. I have taken multiple drugs sometimes 3 at a time and have tried everything - just got off Cymbalta, gabapentin. I could NOT go for walks without taking Vicodin and 800 Motrin. I was tired ALL the time AND unable to sleep. Then my dr. gives me Lyrica and now at 60 I am FINALLY able to live my life with just taking Motrin to help with my walks.

While on Gabapentin my depression and anxiety started getting worse and I was getting agitated, irritable and frustrated easily. I didn't know it was the meds causing it until I started the Pregabalin and everything got so much worse and I even started having suicidal thoughts every day. When I tried to stop talking the Pregabalin I had severe withdrawal symptoms. Such as constant sweating, shivers, hot flashes, agitation and irritable(worse than on Pregabalin), severe pounding headaches and more. When I started this medication I wasn't told it could affect my mental health issues like it did or about the withdrawals. If I had known I would not have ever taken this medication.
