1,Topiramate,Fibromyalgia,2.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"October 26, 2021",0,"Topamax (topiramate):This drug had absolutely no effect on my fibromyalgia symptoms, and on top of that it severely worsened my depression and suicidality. The only benefit I experienced was it inhibited sweating, which was a nice relief albeit not the point. I tried it alone and also with Keppra, to no avail. All of this occurred in my early teens, so I can't remember the exact dosage - I believe I was taking the recommended dosage as suggested by Table 1 in the dosage guide, but only once a day.",Dov B

3,Topiramate,Fibromyalgia,1.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"January 6, 2021",9,"Topamax (topiramate):I went on Topamax 9 months ago. At first it seemed to work then 2 months later in the beginning of summer, I realized I stopped sweating. Then the hair loss started. I became extremely constipated, muscles were sore, feet and hands felt like needles. Towards the end my muscles became weak and a lot of nausea. I still had migraines on a regular basis. My body hurt so much. After 9 months I had severe diarrhea and vomiting. After being off the pill about 2 weeks later my body started feeling better. Doctor says it is the only pill I have left to use. I would rather have the migraines than how awful this pill made me feel.",cinder
4,Topiramate,Fibromyalgia,10.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"June 7, 2020",41,Topamax (topiramate):I have been taking Topamax a long time. I was taking 200mg but I was having memory issues so I asked my doctor if I could try 175 mg and she agreed. It has worked much better. I was taking it all in the morning and I was so tired in the day. I read on here that someone suggested taking half in the am and half in the afternoon. I started that 2 weeks ago and it has made a huge difference my energy level. I use to stay in bed most of the day. Now I bake and do crafts with my kids.,Rln122801
5,Topiramate,Fibromyalgia,9.0,,"January 11, 2020",30,"I take a dose of 200mg  topiramate daily for Fibromyalgia and weight loss after being on lyrica for 3 years. Lyrica (600mg daily) destroyed my brain synapses, gained 15kg and made me more sick than better without taking the fibro pain away.  Topomax at the start was on 50mg (while on lyrica for weight loss) that's when I experienced the brain fog (they call it ""dopamax"" for a reason) you stumble your words, can't think straight etc, but that only lasted a week or so adjusting to the new medication.  Once I heard that topamax at higher dose (200-400 a day) could treat fibro I weaned of lyrica, detoxed myself for 3 months then I started topamax as my treatment. Best decision I ever made. My daily fibro pains are almost non existent, my flare ups are further apart than before. And the weight is falling off. I've lost 17kgs in 12 months. I'm moving again, returned to the gym (still in lots of pain at the gym but it's manageable)This drug is my miracle answer to a long nightmare",Infy

Especially at 50mg and above. Try not eating out fast food will put weight on you like no other, so will diet soda that’s worse for you than regular soda, don’t eat sugar free anything it’s all made with fake sugar your body can deal with real sugar as long as your not making a pig of yourself.

7,Topiramate,Fibromyalgia,10.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"July 22, 2019",11,"I have been taking Topamax for 3 years now, for fibro and bipolar disorder.  My dosage has been 150mg twice daily and on this dosage I have not experienced any pain and my mood has been stable.  Getting onto this drug was difficult for me, I am an ex street drug user and while getting onto this medication it made my body feel like I was withdrawing from drugs at the times I was in between my doses.  Once that was over the normal weight loss that most have, carbonated drinks etc I also experienced.  Something that I have experienced that I have not read about is a MAJOR increase in food sensitivities.  I am in my 40's and I have read that women who are hormonal can become food intolerant while taking Topamax.  Recently I reduced my dosage to 100mg twice daily and my pain has reared its ugly head.   For me topamax is a good medication.  Good luck everyone. ",FibroFiona

I find that a lower dose works best otherwise the side effects, especially aphasia becomes really bad but 50mg strikes a good balance between helping with the aches and pains as well as migraine prevention without too much off the commom side effects.",Poodding

11,Topiramate,Fibromyalgia,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"March 27, 2018",15,"I started this medication for fibromyalgia and weight loss. I had a horrible reaction. I felt like I had the flu, I was cold and hot. The worst part was it was like it sucked all the energy out of me. All I could do was lay in bed and cry. I only got up to get water and go to the bathroom and even that was hard to do. Every time I would get up I felt like I was going to pass out. I would get dizzy and I had shortness of breath. Finally after 5 days I gave up and stopped taking it. Never again will I take this medication.",Blue

The itch was severe by time dose increased to 200mg am and nocte but no,other side effects except possible responsible for my delayed circadian Rythm disorder.

I originally went off of it because I could not handle the side effects. I was then bullied by my mother & doctor into going back on to it because ""it was my only option"". I became face blind, could not navigate my way around even with a map, memory difficulties. issues doing simple math, became asexual & had no motivation to interact with people. Towards the end of my time on topamax I was so depressed that I would just sit despondently.I switched doctors and she immediately stopped it. The side effects went away after stopping the first time but after the 4yrs on it I still have some side effects that haven't completely gone away.",Headachpanda

The side effects can be daunting at first, like tingling/numbness in extremities that won't stop for hours, but if you increase your water intake substantially and power through, it's totally worth it. My daily tension headaches are 90% gone, which is huge for me. It didn't do much in terms of overall muscle pain reduction or the daily body aches, but I did lose over 30 pounds in four months. I stopped drinking all carbonated drinks (because it makes them all taste super flat weirdly) and definitely am not as hungry as I used to be, so that's just a bonus.",Lynn Y.

I also have tried everything with no real help. I also had bad HAIR LOSS for years now. And am not sure what causes it but have found a fix. Onion juice. I liquidity a onion with olive oil. The smell will be horrible, put it on all over hair an scalp. Leave on for an hour or more. Shampoo with dawn dish soap good twice an sock hair twice with vinegar. This will take care of smell. The results were immediate and awesome. Now instead of a hand full of hair with my shower I only have a few strands. I done this two weeks in a row, now I'm gonna go to once a month.",Bokeys
