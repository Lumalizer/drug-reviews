1,Amitriptyline,Fibromyalgia,10.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"March 4, 2022",1,"This drug is amazing.  It changed my life in days as I had fibromyalgia brought on by long term insomnia.  I started with 10mg and within 2 days, my inflammation had drastically reduced, I was sleeping, and had no carpal tunnel pain that I had suffered with for months.  I cannot recommend this highly enough.  I rarely take it now - 4 years on - but occasionally take 10mg to break a spell of not sleeping",minniehaha

Then I went to an osteopath in Oct got told that I may have fibromyalgia and hyper mobile syndrome and was told I was in a flare up! Was taking paracetamol, ibruphen, Naproxin so on whilst waiting for a rheumatology appointment but wasn’t until April 21.  I've been in so much pain mainly in shoulder blades right shoulder feels like comes out socket have no appetite and now problems with liver Had the appointment got told I have fibromyalgia, like I expected ,and been on 30mg  amitript taking at 8.30pm every night but haven’t noticed any difference - if anything I feel worse.  I have pains in ears, throat at the same time I’ve been taking the co drydamol everyday and ibuprofen and just feel worse and worse.  I just want it to go away and now I’m on antibiotics because of this causing sinuses ear infection which just want it to go! 5 weeks on it, shall I stop taking other PKs to let this work?",DLyons85
3,Amitriptyline,Fibromyalgia,7.0,Taken for 10 years or more,"April 11, 2021",1,I have used Endep for many years now for sleep and fibromyalgia. Fibromyalgia has many strange symptoms. At one stage I found that taking my Endep gave me very painful and unpleasant restless legs. I managed this for a while by taking pain relief before taking amitriptyline. Luckily this symptom/side effect passed after a few months. Fibromyalgia symptoms are constantly changing. Sometimes within hours or sometimes years. I had painful sinus headaches for over 4 years every morning. The amitriptyline does have anticholinergic side effects like slowing the digestive system and causing a dry mouth. Which has been a significant problem. But this has just as much caused by fibromyalgia and the side effects can be managed. The amitriptyline has a slow effect on pain. If I stop it for a week my pain levels will slowly increase. And I get some twitches when I do not take it but is not a problem.,Fibrobeen.
4,Amitriptyline,Fibromyalgia,8.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"January 30, 2021",7,"Endep (amitriptyline):Two days after taking Endep 10mg, 50% of my pain was gone. Lasted three days then the pain came back. Up the dose to 20mg and pain reduced again but legs feel twitchy and restless in the day. A weird feeling, usually happens at night. Will keep trying and see if it goes alway. Next step up to 30mg. So far it’s better than being in constant fibromyalgia pain 24/7. It did take 4-5 days to get use to sleep side effect. Within an hour of taking go straight to bed and try and sleep. Able to sleep with only waking once. Does make you tired in the morning but again it’s better than the pain.  Worth a try. Good luck",JJ
5,Amitriptyline,Fibromyalgia,1.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"July 24, 2020",7,"I took amitriptyline for fibromyalgia and hated it, it gave me side effect symptoms of awful brain fog, made me hallucinate when I took it, stopped me from dreaming, made me gain 60lbs in 2 months, and did more harm than good. All it did for me was increase the severity of my symptoms and add more side effects. I stopped taking it and my weight started to drop and the side effects wore off.

6,Amitriptyline,Fibromyalgia,10.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"June 11, 2020",65,"After suffering for years and pain of not knowing that I had fibromyalgia I was finally found a Doctor who sent me to a rheumatologist who diagnosed me in one visit with fibromyalgia. The doctor said I probably had it for a long time I was already taking amitriptyline for depression and for irritable bowel syndrome when the doctor told me that that would be a great medicine for me to try using for fibromyalgia but I had only been taking when I couldn’t sleep. I started taking it every night and my pain level has at least been cut in half, but taking the amitriptyline every night if you skip it it’s not effective you have to take it every night to be effective for fibromyalgia. I have never had any side effects or bad reactions to amitriptyline and I have been taking it for five years",SG
7,Amitriptyline,Fibromyalgia,6.0,,"April 27, 2020",11,I have tried Cymbalta and Lyrica for fibro pain...both caused severe cognitive fog & memory loss.  Gabepentin didn't help the pain.  Amitriptyline worked for the pain until I started gaining more and more weight.  I have scoliosis and the weight gain was excruciating for me.  So I guess I'm back to T3s every 4 hours.  The only thing that seems to work for the pain and doesn't cause side effects.,Jello

Life has changed significantly for the better since the introduction of amitriptyline, I take 25mgs at bedtime. I experience significant drowsiness in the morning and I initially had a very dry mouth.  The dry mouth subsided but the morning ""hangover"" feeling continues. I can live with it!! I have almost no pain, I can eat again ( previously had severe IBS), I sleep now (the quality is still questionable some night), it reduced my mild anxiety, and rid myself of my headaches.

My pain was reduced but not eliminated. However, it has not helped me reduce my brain fog, fatigue or insomnia. I believe that amitriptyline has made all of my other fibromyalgia symptoms, excluding pain, worse. Additionally, I had many side effects associated with taking amitriptyline. Most notably, I gained nearly 40 lbs. Since the extra weight made it hard to exercise and caused me to have more pain, I asked my doctor to reduce my dosage. Now I have more pain, less weight, slightly more energy and I am searching for a new medicine for my fibromyalgia.",Kris

I also take 150mg of lyrica a day to make it threw an 8 hour shift. Without lyrica I wouldn't be able to work at all.  I would wake up with my hair being a total mess like I was sleeping restless. My doctor said to start this at 20mg before bed and if that dose doesn't help increase by 10mg until I get to a level that works.First couple nights have been wonderful. But I have been waking up at 6am both days and can't go back to sleep. I feel rested and alot less morning pain. Doctor is hoping I can go off lyrica.  Lyrica is causing me to feel high.

25,Amitriptyline,Fibromyalgia,10.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"September 18, 2017",34,I started it and noticed I slept well after first tablet. The 10mg works better for fibromyalgia on low dose apparently (10mg) but anyway I took it daily an hour or two before bed but it did take a good 4 months to get into my system and work on blocking out most of my pain and actually get to grips with my own personal experiences with this chronic condition.  It worked really well on my migraines I  get them occasionally if I eat food triggers wheat - dairy - msg amongst other triggers  but not nearly as bad as before I started taking amitriptyline. I can honestly say its given me back my life and can plan ahead which I have never been able to do before.  I gave it a   10/10.  My side effects were dry mouth for few weeks and I watch my diet because it can increase your appetite,gigiboo

Ami was a life saver to me in regards to pain relief. As for depression & anxiety, it wasn't helpful until I combined it with Wellbutrin. I would highly recommend the combo for Fibro fog/fatigue/pain/anxiety/depression. It's like taking an SNRI without the side effects!
