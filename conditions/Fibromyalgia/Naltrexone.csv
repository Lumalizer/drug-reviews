1,Naltrexone,Fibromyalgia,7.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"December 27, 2021",0,I start this medication as 12 years with chronic fatigue and managed it until recently where I had to leave my job. I started on 0.5mg and worked up by 0.5 every 10 days. I saw an immediate improvement however I’m now on 3mg and I feel like the energy is decreasing again. Has anyone had this? Does it mean I need to decrease the dose or increase higher than 3mg? Thanks!,Sharirose247

4,Naltrexone,Fibromyalgia,2.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"August 12, 2021",3,"I experienced some odd side effects: drowsy all day on low dose, hard time working as all I wanted to do was sleep. No pain relief for fibromyalgia, instead I woke up each morning with stiffness and pain in lower limbs to knees and neck and upper arms pain to elbow. In addition I felt down most of the time, just depressed and blue. I also had diarrhea throughout the day. Bizarre side effects included the limb stiffness and unusually frequent sexual thoughts, not normal for me. My appetite was lower and I slept longer at night. It was very difficult to work though with drowsiness all day, made pushing through heavy fatigue difficult. I drove my car to do errands nearby and had trouble navigating and drove over curbs a couple of times. That scared me. So finally with these side effects in a two week period I stopped taking the med. My side effects are unusual from what I have read.",SC in Vancouver Canada

6,Naltrexone,Fibromyalgia,2.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"April 24, 2021",9,"I’ve been taking LDN for my autoimmune condition, Graves’ disease, for over 5 years now at 4.5 mg, just recently down to 3 mg. I’ve never gone completely into remission this time around though I’ve gotten close, but my numbers have been all over the place. I feel like it may have improved my sleep a bit, but since it’s hard to see whether or not it’s actually helping my autoimmune disease, I’ve tried to stop taking it various times over the last few years and wake up at night, a few hours in, with body aches, restlessness, and stiffness every time I don’t take it or forget to take it. I’ve searched and can’t find anyone else who has experienced this. It doesn’t seem like a good thing that I’m experiencing these withdraw symptoms when I don’t take LDN. If I take it when I wake up in the middle of the night, the symptoms stop.... I don’t experience any negative effects while taking LDN. Are these LDN withdraw symptoms?",Withdraw symptoms - body aches

9,Naltrexone,Fibromyalgia,9.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"December 15, 2020",125,"In response to BP, I’ve learned that Naltrexone is most effective at lower dosages for Fibromyalgia, but the smaller dosages have to be compounded individually. Most towns/cities have compounding pharmacies or hospital pharmacies capable of compounding for you. My ‘script runs about $45 for 90 pills. I started at .75mg for a week, 1.5mg. for a week, then 3.0mg, and finally, 4.5mg. By increasing it gradually over a month’s time, I avoided much of the new med issues. The doc said we could go up to 9mg, if necessary.  I can’t take opioids nor narcotics, so Naltrexone has been a Godsend for me. I have Lupus, Fibromyalgia and severe arthritis in my neck. Naltrexone is the only drug that has worked - and has worked without the nasty side effects of other drugs. Hope this info helps!",Rapelje
10,Naltrexone,Fibromyalgia,9.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"November 29, 2020",14,"I have suffered from fibromyalgia and chronic fatigue syndrome for over 15 years. I tried so many different medications in that time, none helped. Then I was prescribed low dose Naltrexone by a specialist. It helped immensely, I felt better within two weeks. I was able to get up on the exam table without a thought. Before any exertion at all was difficult, painful, and would leave me sore and exhausted for up to a week. I feel almost normal now. My dose is on the high end for low dose at 5mg, and I have to get it at a compounding pharmacy (just Google and call). My doctor said it works for about 50% of patients. I suggest reading up on the mechanism of action before asking for a prescription. In short it stimulates natural endorphins and has a mild anti-autoimmune effect. It only stays in your system for four hours. Always check for drug interactions. Good luck!",Bina
11,Naltrexone,Fibromyalgia,9.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"November 25, 2020",21,"I tried naltrexone at a low dose of 4.5 mg dose years ago for fibromyalgia, and it had no effect on my pain levels.  But at a higher dose (I started with 24.5 mg and now take 50 mg) it is extraordinarily effective.  I'm thrilled with this result, but I worry about the long-term effects, so I do not plan to take it indefinitely.  The side effects - energy, a spacey feeling - I find pleasant.  But this also makes me worry that perhaps this is just another painkiller, and that I'll build up a tolerance and be worse off when I try to wean myself off it.  It's promoted as safer and non-addictive, but not enough is known about it yet for those claims to be trusted.  It perplexes me that naltrexone is an opioid antagonist, but it feels slightly like an opioid to me. So I'm trilled to have relief from the pain, but I proceed with caution.",Nutmeg

But I insisted...desperate to try anything.  However, it was for 1/2 of a 50mg tablet once per day. I felt like I had done a gram of cocaine. 2-3 hrs of sleep per night, major anxiety, heart racing etc. Couldn't focus, hands shook etc.I stuck with it for one week when I realized, my pain had dropped SIGNIFICANTLY for the FIRST time in about seven years. Thrilled at he results I had to figure out how to continue the medication but get rid of the side affects and get some sleep.I called the doc to ask what I could do as the online info said it said LDN should be 1.5 mg.

I thought I might have eaten something bad so I rode it out. It happened the next night, at the exact same time as before. I began to suspect it. The same thing happened again at the same time. I told my doctor and we stopped it. It was just 1mg.This drug feels cult-ish. It's really hard to find someone to prescribe it. My rheumatologist wanted me to take it but she said she couldn't write it. Why? And look into the trials done with LDN. One of the books about it tries to convince patients that testimonials are just as good as double blind testing. That's not how science works.It supposedly treats a laundry list of things from cancer to MS. That's a red flag.Please research this. You'll find people without medical licenses prescribing it and people getting their ability to prescribe it taken away. It's a very suspicious situation.",ajt123

At 25 though, I got hit with a wave of intense brain fog. I couldn't read a paragraph & retain the information, leaving the oven on, front door unlocked, driving my marriage into the ground because I wouldn't remember conversations, getting lost in the grocery store, had to withdraw from my college classes. It was this bad for nearly a year. Getting the Fibro diagnose only tanked my moral. I felt like like an 85 year old with dementia, & have a disease most people think is BS. Yay! I've been on LDN for 3 months now & found those 50 IQ points I had lost in the fog. I'm no longer an elderly young person! I'm reading books, back in school & getting 100% on assignments.

My body was just inflamed and it constant pain. When I moved everything felt tight, sore and painful. My inflammation was very high and my doctor put me on 9mg of LDN to start. I was at that dose for about 9 months and my inflammation was still very high and I was also still struggling to lose weight. My doctor upped the LDN to the full dose naltrexone level of 50mg to help with the weigh tloss and it did, between the 9mg and 50mg I lost 30lbs. However, the 50mg dose was a little too high for me, as it made me so sleepy, so I dropped it down to roughly 32mg, but I take it in split doses of 16mg, 12 hours apart. That has proved to be my perfect dose. I no longer have any body aches or pains, I wake up feeling 20 again and the naltrexone gives me energy throughout the day.

I feel as though my doctor is not familiar with this choice of treatment for fibro and so I was surprised when she actually prescribed it. I did seek the advice of the  compilation of research out there for LDN to see it there are better titration schedules. I started 1.5mg for 7 days and honestly only took the first 3 doses over 6 days, so every other day. Then I took dose 4,5,6,& 7 in consecutive nights. Tonight is my first time using to the 3mg dose. I feel it's too soon to truly asses the effectiveness of the drug but I am already noticing a harder time falling asleep on 3mg. It kinda gave me energy so I might try a morning dose.Question though, has anyone got this as an approved method of treatment under their primary health insurance for fibro?

27,Naltrexone,Fibromyalgia,10.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"August 18, 2019",102,Hi. It is very important to titrate VERY SLOWLY to your naltrexone dose for fibromyalgia. I had pills that were 3 milligrams.  I divided it up by thirds the first two weeks then by half the second two weeks. Then divided up by thirds again taking 2/3 at a time for two weeks until I was on the whole 3 mg dose. I’ve never gone up from there. I had debilitating hip pain due to Hashimoto’s end it is go on or down to a one or two on the pain scale.  It was a rough transition. It really messed up my sleep and I’m already in insomniac. I will never go without this medicine. I’m not somebody who likes to take meds. If you had a bad reaction maybe try very low-dose for a long time and slowly build up. By the way when I first got it I tried the whole dose and I was a mess. That’s why I went slow.,Ann

After that I switched back to taking it at night because I take other medications at that time and struggled to remember my low-dose naltrexone (LDN) in the morning. It doesn’t disturb my sleep anymore and I wake up refreshed most days. If I know I’m going to have a physically taxing day, I will skip my evening dose and take it first thing in the morning. I’ve found this enables me to go all day without pain or feeling overly tired.

Thinking I may either reduce or go off all together to see what happens. NZ dollars $59 a month.",Sangoma

44,Naltrexone,Fibromyalgia,9.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"November 26, 2016",108,"I developed a condition that had symptoms like fibromyalgia, Ms, Lupus  after a surgery. I was at my worst when I discovered this drug. Low dose Naltrexone helps me a lot. I'm on 1.5 mg. I skip doses once in 3-4 days when I start feeling wired and over stimulated. Works great.. Made me feel better, helped with skin conditions no doctor able to cure. Only bad part is that it kind-of over stimulates you once in a while. Makes you feel all wired. Have to stop the dose for a day or two and it's gets normal.",Arun P
45,Naltrexone,Fibromyalgia,,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"November 8, 2016",69,Have had fibromyalgia for 22 years.  Tried all sorts of the recommended meds. Two months ago started 4.5 mg low dose naltrexone.  Fall asleep easily but horrible and disturbing dreams and subsequent pain from disturbed sleep.  Sometimes I'd sleep 10 to 12 hrs and just slightly refreshed.  Have a hard time getting going after waking for up to two hours.  Just stopped taking it because of the side effects.

46,Naltrexone,Fibromyalgia,7.0,,"October 16, 2016",84,I have been slowly increasing my LDN for fibromyalgia for the last several weeks. It has provided better relief than the Fentanyl 100 mcg that I had been on for years! Very hopeful that I will find my optimal dose and feel even better- I have had pain relief and an increase in energy. It caused insomnia though so I changed the dose to the a.m. with no drowsiness noted.,Elderly2

During the first week I felt some of the muscle cramping associated with Naltrexone but that and my nerve pain subsided after about a week. The next three weeks sailed by and my activity level increased as I was essentially free of CRPS/RSD nerve pain. The chronic pain in my lower back was significantly decreasing too. When my supply ran out I experienced some of the CRPS/RSD pain but not at the level I'd had before. That wasn't the case with my chronic lower back pain and that came rearing back.It was a month before my Dr could get me the compounded LDN. Again, my pain has dissipated.

All I was doing was work, recover, and burn through an excessive amount of sick, vacation, and banked time. At home I was almost zombie like. I would spend all of my time curled up on the sofa in pain, fog, or fatigue. Thanks to LDN:Today I was able to pool run for 30 min! I did laundry and sorted all of the socks.

52,Naltrexone,Fibromyalgia,9.0,,"October 19, 2015",72,I started naltrexone Dec. of 2014. I started noticing improvement after about 4 weeks. I no longer had hot flashes. Then my pain started to get less and shorter periods of flare ups. Then longer periods of feeling much better and even days of feeling good and not constantly fatigued. This lasted until about 6 weeks ago. I started having hot flashes again and a really bad flare up that has gone on for a month.

Diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) in 2010 with a rheumatoid factor (RF) of 361. Started antibiotic therapy (described at Rheumatic.org/faq) in September 2010. Summer of 2012 my RF was down to 25. Started LDN that fall. RF now down to 14.9 (0-14.5 is normal). I have NO symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis. Even my doctor is impressed. The LDN helped boost my health overall. It even prevented my seasonal hayfever. I have found, however, that not all generics are created equal. ",Awondergal

I was able to work, function as a normal person & pain was manageable.  In June I had several pulled muscles & a rotator cuff injury - pain was off the charts. The doctors in Tucson will not write pain meds under any circumstances - cut me off cold turkey and I pulled neck muscle.  For 6 months my pain level was a 15 (scale of 1-10) suicidal pain with no relief in site.  I was referred to country doctor in Wilcox, AZ - he said he would write me pain meds, but was I willing to try a alternate prescription that would possible get rid of my pain.

I don't have normal energy or drive but my life is so much closer to normal than it was a year ago, I have no complaints.  The only other medication I take is for high blood pressure. The only side effect I have is a slight headache when I wake in the morning but it ALWAYS goes away soon after I get up.
