0,Guaifenesin,Fibromyalgia,9.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"January 16, 2022",0,Okay so hear me out. I found this by mistake and after reading reviews I can see Mucinex has helped others with Fibromaylagia. There is no way it's a placebo. Let me start by saying I've been sick with cold viruses before and have taken the 400mg doses of mucinex and never saw a difference in pain.. This is the first time I went and picked up the 600mg extended release to take twice a day vs the 400mg twice a day for my chest congestion and there is a difference. It isn't drastic to where all my pain is gone but I do have other health and spine conditions but enough to where I knew something was very different and didn't know what. I figured maybe because I was sick that my body was in a more relaxed state so my pain was down but I never felt this way before ever.  I plan on trying 800-1200 twice a a day but so far I'm extremely impressed even with the 600mg extended release twice a day. I've only been taking for 3 days and waking up without morning stiffness is huge!,BNW37
1,Guaifenesin,Fibromyalgia,10.0,Taken for 5 to 10 years,"January 4, 2022",0,"After discovering the guaifenesin protocol for fibromyalgia 6 years ago, I have been able to reverse 90% of my symptoms. My case had been very severe, and I was giving up on life. I was 49 then and doctors were out of ideas, and told me I had the body of a 95 year old. After a dozen or more bone spur and related surgeries (and still no FM diagnosis) I researched what these accumulated deposits were made of (calcium phosphate) and sent away for a simple hair analysis test. The hair test was telling.Extremely high phosphate and calcium. After research I stumbled on the guaifenesin protocol by Dr. St. Amand, and everything suddenly made sense. The theory is centered on phosphate retention.  That day I diagnosed myself with FM and have never looked back, improving daily since. The protocol can cause deep discomfort if too much guaifenesin is taken, (I only need 150mgLA/day) and you need to cycle all your old symptoms again in reverse to get ""clear"", but it really works and saved my life.",Kimmie#19

Guaifensen 2400mg to 4800 mg a day loosens my muscles that are tight and painful. I'm able to breathe deeper with the relaxed muscles. My stomach isn't as irritated, and skin isn't as irritated. My anxiety is lessened. I've also included Ribose powder 10 to 15 mg a day and it helps with fatigue.",dmalfese
4,Guaifenesin,Fibromyalgia,10.0,Taken for 5 to 10 years,"March 8, 2021",21,"Guaifenesin saved my life! I follow Dr St Amand’s protocol precisely, salicylic acid free. I was mostly bedridden, everything hurt from washing my hair to getting dressed. IBS symptoms got so severe that it didn’t matter what I ate, it hurt. As I started the protocol with guaifenesin, my symptoms slowly started to disappear and I started having more good days than bad. It no longer hurts to eat! It no longer hurts to get hugs! I can open jars again! I work 30-50 hours a week and survive without crashing! Every doctor should be prescribing this protocol! Guaifenesin has zero side effects for me, and I am very sensitive to the efficacy of drugs, alcohol, sugar, caffeine, and pain and allergy medications.",Turned180
5,Guaifenesin,Fibromyalgia,9.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"October 18, 2020",27,"As strange as this may sound, I have found that good old Mucinex, that is, active ingredient *guaifenesin,* really helps amazingly with my stiff and achy hip/haunch muscles, tendons, and ligaments. I suffered a very minor injury years ago, but the area around it became stiffer and more painful over time. I noticed once when I had a bad cold and was taking the usual cold remedies that my hip area felt suddenly better.  I narrowed it down to the effect of guaifenesin.  Since then, I have found that many fibromyalgia sufferers also report an amazingly beneficial effect of guaifenesin on their stiff muscles!  It really does work, is sold over-the-counter, and I notice no side effects.  They make 600mg tabs, but even 1/2 tab per day really helps me.  I hope it helps you too!!",Activetraveler
6,Guaifenesin,Fibromyalgia,10.0,,"August 29, 2020",5,When I was first diagnosed with fibromyalgia this was the first drug I was started on and what a miracle. Then it was taken off the market to go onto the OTC side of the store (Over the counter). Over the years I would get a cold and every time my pain disappeared I was happy no pain but a stubborn nose drip. Over the past 10 years I could not wait till I got a cold now I am gonna try the guaifenesin protocol even I do remember it was a higher dosage than normal this will probably be expensive but it is worth it.,Susan

Never heard of that. So, here I am, reading up on it. I have fibromyalgia, and multiple sclerosis.  The fibromyalgia symptoms are way worse than the MS.  So, any advice, or what kind I should buy, where, dosage, etc. I’m excited to try the Guaifenesin!Thanks.",Catherine
8,Guaifenesin,Fibromyalgia,9.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"August 2, 2020",14,I didn’t read about it first. I took Guaifenesin for a cold and I started feeling so much better about my fibromyalgia pain. Then I researched about it. Guaifenesin kind of cleanses the tips of the nerves and releases the knots. I felt the relieve immediately but other people say it takes time. It’s great.,Marta

I am 76, and I can accomplish more at this age than I did at 63. My Fibro pain and the feeling that I was exhausted all the time has been gone for years.  Two little over the counter pills, taken twelve hours apart, reversed all my symptoms. This does not happen overnight. The paperback book, written by Dr. Paul St. Amand,  ""What Your Doctor May Not Tell You About Fibromyalgia"" explained it all. My doctor approved of the protocol with a wave of his hand. ""Give it a try,"" he said. ""It can't hurt you."" So I did, and, over time, following the protocol precisely, which meant finding MY correct dose, I improved until I was completely reversed. I now have my life back.",rhymingartist

11,Guaifenesin,Fibromyalgia,10.0,,"November 6, 2019",35,"Many yrs ago I was in an FMS support group that filled out forms for Bennett. Not sure if Dr Armand was around then. During this time many members of group did the Guaifenesin protocol as it was just being discussed then. Whenever I had a cold I took Guaifenesin and felt much better, but when I went off it Fibromyalgia pains returned. I was diagnosed at the time as a severe, hard-to -treat case.  I got into Hormones which helped immensely.Recently I've a bad cold and taking Guaifenesin again. A lot of very bad pain I’ve had from an injury that affected the muscles, ligaments, tendons on right side from neck to knee were alleviated by taking the Guaifenesin. No other reason for it.  My cold was awful, but my body pains had subsided. I’m thinking of going on Guaifenesin Protocol again to see if relief continues. I’ve had FM for 30 yrs. Has affected every aspect of my life. Will try Guaifenesin again and see what happens. Thank you for your interest.",Pat
12,Guaifenesin,Fibromyalgia,10.0,,"November 1, 2019",46,"I have been disabled with Fibromyalgia  and Interstitial Cystitis for over 20 years.  In May 2019, I caught a bad cold.  I took Guiafenesin to help with the congestion.  One night, during that time, I woke up and found that all my Fibromyalgia/Interstitial Cystitis pain was gone!  The pain reprieve was short lived, but it gave me enough time to search online and find out about Guiafenesin and Fibromyalgia.  I read the members reviews, here at drug.com, and saw other people were getting results with Guiafenesin and Fibromyalgia.  I have now been on the Guiafenesin protocol for 6 months and both my Fibromyalgia and Interstitial Cystitis symptoms have dramatically improved. The Guiafenesin protocol is not a quick fix though.  There is more to the protocol than just taking Guiafenesin.  If you have Fibromyalgia and want to give the Guiafenesin protocol a try, get the book ""What Your Doctor May Not Tell You About Fibromyalgia,"" by R.

I found out about the use of guaifenesin and started the protocol. It’s not easy, as you have to be so careful about what you eat and put on your skin, so I wouldn’t recommend it unless you’ve tried other options first. The Guaifenesin absolutely worked  for my fibromyalgia and all my pain has subsided as well as my fatigue. It was well worth it!

My doctors kept trying to put me on different medications - gabapentin, melodocam, naproxen - you name it, I’ve tried it. However all of them gave me unwanted side effects. So I researched and read everything I could find ran out natural ways to manage or reduce pain. I stumbled upon The Guaifenesin protocol for fibromyalgia and was intrigued. However, it seemed so restrictive that I decided it wasn’t for me. But I felt like it wouldn’t hurt to just buy the Mucinex tablets 600mg (2x a day) extended release. Literally, the first day my pain levels went from a 9 to a 5. Currently it’s barely noticeable now. Also, no side effects!!! I’ve been on it for a month.

17,Guaifenesin,Fibromyalgia,9.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"February 5, 2019",29,"This is a hard one. I have read nearly everything there is to read on Guaifenesin and Dr Anands treatment. I recommend you do the same. Have I improved? Yes, very much, I think... I need to go back and get mapped again. The confusion is the length of time of treatment, and if you are blocking or not. You must journal and map, or over a 6 months you just are not sure of improvement. Some pains are the same but the brain fog is completely gone and I have much more energy. So life still sucks but not as bad as it was six months ago. It it the Guai? I think so??? I hope so? Btw, those of you that gave a 1 star because you felt so tired?

That was it. Nothing has improved since then. I still have the same exact problems I've had for years. All I can say is I'm glad I'm not in as much pain as some others on this message board.

Note: I also discovered that I should have been  paying attention to the pain  and not assuming it was just part of the Guaifenesin treatment.  This delayed discovering what was truly wrong.,Suzi

I was completely better within a year, I would guess.  I have stopped using Guaifenesin for 3-4 years now and have no recurring problems.

Months later, stiff and unable to get around and work without severe pain in my lower back and neck, stiffness in my hips and knees, and general achiness all over, I decided to give it another shot. I have Crohn's disease which causes fibromyalgia symptoms. Since the Crohn's didn't seem to be negatively affected by the Mucinex, I started on it again last week. No pain in my lower back, still just a bit stiff in my neck. I am so happy that back pain is gone. I can do things again and not hurt. I don't have to be on narcotics and I sleep like a baby. I recommend at least trying it.",pollywannacracker

I am a pre-med student and when I heard about the possibility of Mucinex(Guaifenesin) being able to relieve pain caused by Fibromyalgia I decided to try it.  It has worked better than NSAID'S (Ibuprofen, Aleve, Celebrex) for me.  400mg works great (600mg if using the extended release tablets.)",smoore002

For a cough it helps by enabling free-er breathing, loosens, disolves flem.""Guf"" used for treating fibromyalgia has done wonderfully for me, but you MUST ADHERE to a strict diet for AT LEAST ten days while dosing, I felt good results in a few days and it gave me the inccentive to keep doing it for 14 days, I felt so good, the diet is described in a small green book called ""what your doctor didn't tell you about fibro.",macadoodle
