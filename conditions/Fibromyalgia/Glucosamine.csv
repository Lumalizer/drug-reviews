0,Glucosamine,Fibromyalgia,10.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"January 6, 2020",6,"Not diagnosed with Fibromyalgia but have tested negative on rheumatoid type diseases. I have been having pain in my joints especially on my hands, knees and feet. All my blood results are normal. The pains started to emerge at the same time when I stopped my anti depression pills I took for 12 years (slowly stopped over a year, not instantly) So I am thinking I might have FM as a result of prolonged use of anti depression pills. I saw those glaucosomine supplements in drug store and wanted to give a try. And without knowing the reason my pains diminished. Later I got flu and stopped taking Glaucosomine and my pains started. The I understood that it was glaucosomine ( chondroitin, MSM and bloswella extract)",Aykut Karaca
1,Glucosamine,Fibromyalgia,,Taken for less than 1 month,"October 10, 2018",12,"I was diagnosed with fibromyalgia four years ago. I tried an anti inflammatory/ gluten free ish diet, cold/hot therapy, multi vitamins, decaf only coffee, and reduced sugars. These all seemed to work on and off combined. I would have good and bad days. My mother told me to try glucosamine and I added that to my normal 300 mg 3x a day routine of gabapentin. I never felt much relief with gab, but on my fourth day of taking glucosamine I will stop gaba if the pain relief continues passed day four. Best suggestion I’ve ever followed even from all the doctors and specialists I’ve seen. Do not understand why it’s not promoted more for fibro people. Please try!",Jess
2,Glucosamine,Fibromyalgia,10.0,,"July 18, 2010",55,"I have been diagnosed with Fibromyalgia and have been on so many different medicines trying to find one that works best on me, but no matter what I take I still have lots of pain. I tried Glucosamine a week ago and on the fourth day of taking it I noticed a big difference in my joint and muscle pain. I feel I have felt better in the last week of taking this than I have since I've had Fibro. I have recently stopped my Lyrica and Dilaudid. I haven't noticed any side effects so far.",las66sm
