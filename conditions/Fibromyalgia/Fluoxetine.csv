1,Fluoxetine,Fibromyalgia,1,,"May 25, 2016",13,"This was horrible for me. Within three hours of taking a 20mg dose I was wide awake, stomach churning like a cement mixer, nausea, vomiting, no sleep and a horrible time delay type sensation.",JOFRANKA
2,Fluoxetine,Fibromyalgia,3,Taken for less than 1 month,"September 7, 2015",6,"Horrible insomnia, even with diazepam and zolpidem. Unfortunately, can't wait the ""few weeks"" to insomnia disappear, or my pain will get worse. I took escitalopram before for five weeks, and the insomnia didn't abate",Room_101
3,Fluoxetine,Fibromyalgia,10,,"May 19, 2015",115,"I have been taking 40-60mg of fluoxetine (prozac) for depression for about 4 years and had never realised it had such an effect on my fibro until now. I have been COMPLETELY pain and fatigue free for a few years and stupidly thought my fibromyalgia had just gone away but I came off the prozac a month ago and it is back with a vengeance. I cannot attribute it to anything else. Fluoxetine has totally relieved me of my depression AND fibromyalgia and i cannot recommend it enough. I really hope it can help others as much as it has helped me.",canessa
4,Fluoxetine,Fibromyalgia,7,,"August 8, 2011",67,"Prozac (fluoxetine):Helped me to stop crying on a daily basis which I was doing because of my Fibromyalgia pain. Still have the pain, but have a better attitude.",Anonymous

6,Fluoxetine,Fibromyalgia,9,,"September 15, 2008",53,"I had many sleepless nights because my mind wouldn't shut off. A rheumatologist finally tested me for fibromyalgia and I learned I had that, not a sleep disorder per se. I have been taking 20mg of fluoxetine with 10mg of amitriptyline for several years now and have normal sleeping patterns. The only down side I have noticed is that if I skip a dose, the next day I have stomach problems. My doctor said that would happen. Stopping this drug can be done successfully only with a doctor's supervision.",Fugwump
