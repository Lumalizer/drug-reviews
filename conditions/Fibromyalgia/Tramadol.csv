0,Tramadol,Fibromyalgia,10.0,Taken for 10 years or more,"March 31, 2022",0,"I have been taking just 50 mg (rarely sometimes two times a day) for about 14 years by now. I really can't do without it. I sometimes don't take it when I'm doing better and 2-3 days I start feeling bad. I really try not to take it, but it helps me. It seems to help the brain fog on a bad pain day. I have bipolar disorder, so antidepressants are NOT for me. I worry that my provider will retire or pass away and someone will not give this to me. I don't know what I would do. I am in a lot of pain without it. With it, my pain is mostly manageable though I am still really exhausted a lot of the time, unless hypomanic.",Catherine W.

I tossed it in the trash and went to edibles. Best thing I ever did after 20 years of narcotics.Never had this kind of trouble with any other pain pill.

2,Tramadol,Fibromyalgia,,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"March 7, 2022",1,"After back surgery healed I was left with an overall feeling of fatigue and unexplained body aches that were debilitating.  I woke up aching and stiff and I couldn't function because of the fatigue. Taking 50 mg tramadol in the morning takes all the issues away and I can function like a normal person.  Sometimes the ""feelings"" start creeping in during the evening if I have had a particularly stressful day so I am prescribed to take another and I do.  I find if I take one before bed, I wake up feeling great.  My primary care doctor does not approve of it but I don't care.  I tried over the counter.  They don't work.  Tramadol works and gives me quality of life.  The fact that I have to be on a DEA watch list and can only get this drug from a pain management doctor ticks me off.  I look at it as an Aleve on steroids.  I wonder what's better taking 4 or 5 over the counter or one tramadol.  I have no side effects.  I just feel good.",Laura

I tried Pregabalin but couldn't tolerate it. I asked to try Tramadol and what a difference, they are a wonderful drug for Fibro pain, to alleviate anxiety and lift your mood most probably because you don't feel overwhelmed with pain.

11,Tramadol,Fibromyalgia,9.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"October 3, 2019",34,"This tramadol has been a godsend for my fibro. My doc originally prescribed this to me for bursitis in my hip. To my surprise, it helped more for my fibro symptoms. I'm 40 and have had symptoms since my late teens. My doc was surprised when I told her its helping more than anything ever has. She said it usually makes fibro worse. As I read some of the positive comments I can totally relate. It makes me not think about the pain and gives me energy and also helps with my depression sometimes. The only thing I don't like that I have noticed is around 6 hours after taking it, it makes me very drowsy and fuzzy. There are times though it keeps me awake too. Some days I only take half. Also I found that if I have to clean or work on a project I take it before I start, because I know my body and I will be hurting if I don't.",Jenjen
12,Tramadol,Fibromyalgia,10.0,,"September 9, 2019",51,"I have taken Tramadol for about five years.  It has been a miracle drug for me.  After having suffered through all the symptoms of fibromyalgia, my biggest complaint was the tiredness and lack of energy.  After taking Tramadol the first time, I had a noticeable increase in energy and general well-being.  I now take 100mg 3 times a day.  Although the effects are not as noticeable as before, it still helps to increase my energy to where I am able to be more productive.  One 7.5mg Norco and two Tramadol every 4 to 6 hours have helped me get through the day.  My mom and two sisters also have this disease.  My daughter was recently diagnosed with fibromyalgia.  She is currently using the CBD oil, and so far it has been somewhat effective.  Like so many of us with this disease, I’m praying for the cure.",Mary
13,Tramadol,Fibromyalgia,7.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"August 2, 2019",20,"Tramadol seems to be the only medication so far that helps with my fibro pain. I do get side effects (feeling ""dopey"", difficulties concentrating and difficulties with sleeping), but through trial and error I have worked out that a daily dose of 50 mg taken in the evening (often combined with paracetamol) works reasonably well and keeps side effects to a minimum. When I have a serious flare, I go up to 3 x 50 mg per day, but then I cannot work as I  feel  too stoned. I am reluctant to take it permanently due to the risk of dependency, but for the moment, I am just glad that it is exists. I do not want to take duloxetine due to the common withdrawal problems and problematic long-term effects, and unfortunately, I cannot tolerate pregabalin; I will try amitriptyline soon. Lidocaine patches seem to help only with superficial pain.I find alternative treatments (supplements, TENS, acupuncture, massages, yoga and mindfulness) helpful, but they are just not effective enough.",Polly

I am more creative on this medication, and  while taking it for pain  when I had a  head cold I noticed that it literally alleviates all cold symptoms!

18,Tramadol,Fibromyalgia,9.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"March 26, 2019",30,"For me, Ultram (Tramadol), combined with Neurontin (Gabapentin), and Elavil (Amitriptyline) work wonders for my fibromyalgia. Take away any one of these and my quality of life plummets downward. I have a multitude of symptoms. These are life saving drugs for me. Without them, I have so much more acute and widespread lingering pain, numbness, creepy crawlies, itching, fatigue, and depression, that I need motility assistance (arm cuff crutches) and get little sleep from my symptoms keeping me awake. Unfortunately, the individuals who have abused these life saving drugs along with the government blanketing all with the potential abuse of these drugs have caused so many to suffer at great costs. My insurance company has recently decided that I do not have enough diagnostic criteria to warrant paying for Tramadol. It is not an expensive drug, so I am able to pay for it out-of-pocket...at least for now, anyway.",Littlepain

I had previously had to have Tramadol due to a shoulder injury I sustained 9 years ago, and it was used for 18 months until I found out I was having my oldest son and then I came off it. It worked for the first fortnight this time around, I could rest if I needed and actually sleep without too much pain, I felt like after several relapses that I found the key to trying to maintain my usual lifestyle as much as I could - for the sake of my children needing a ""fun"" mommy and for myself to just feel a bit better about the whole of my life flipping upside down. But now it won't even move a minor headache.I am getting no relief at all, the pain can vary from stabbing to burning to twinges, all minor and severe on the pain spectrum and it does nothing.

20,Tramadol,Fibromyalgia,10.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"December 20, 2018",44,I have been suffering with fibromyalgia for years. Tramadol was prescribed to me for another short term condition.  Since it was short term I had plenty left. One achy day I used tramadol in fear of stomach bleeding by combining ibuprofen and celexa. That’s when I learned tramadol not only relieves the aches and pains of fibromyalgia but also relived the fatigue. Pain relief also seemed to last much longer than ibuprofen. Of course I asked my doctor to prescribe it to me for fibromyalgia and I could tell she was hesitant but went ahead anyway. I had to switch doctors and of course this doctor refused to give it to me so I’m back to laying in bed and missing a lot of work due to the aches and fatigue. For me this medicine was a miracle drug. I’d suggest it to anyone suffering with fibromyalgia.,Nicole
21,Tramadol,Fibromyalgia,9.0,,"December 1, 2018",24,"I have a complex history of autoimmune problems and fibromyalgia.  I had tried multiple different medications including NSAIDs, tricyclics, SSRIs, lyrica, and cymbalta.  What worked best for years was low dose oxycontin 5-10mg twice a day. My doctor suggested long-acting tramadol, because she knew I was worried about the anti-oxycontin push by government agencies and misinformed doctors and worried oxycontin would be made illegal ( other schedule II narcotics like fentanyl and methadone made me too tired to function). Tramadol worked even better than oxycontin. Both agents caused constipation, Ultram at 300mg a day  caused  twice as much ( based on how many senna pills I needs to take).  Both agents caused insomnia, tramadol caused more ( I needed 5mg ambien to sleep with low dose  oxycontin but I need 10 mg with tramadol 300mg long acting).   Now I am told there is a manufacturer shortage of tramadol and hope I will not have to go back to oxycontin.",Toomanypills

24,Tramadol,Fibromyalgia,1.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"June 20, 2018",11,I started taking Tramadol for chronic pain due to many years of fibromyalgia.  It helped somewhat with pain the true problem was the depression that started almost immediately.  I tolerated the depression for as long as I could.  I was not on a high dose. Only up to 3 daily but even at 1 the depression was constant ...waking me at night with despairing thoughts.  When I chose to stop taking it I was miserable.  Worse than coming off of oxycodone in higher amounts and worse than benzos.   Restless leg syndrome was constant for a week and then the psychosis that almost sent me to the emergency room.   Stay away from this drug.  If you don’t have issues with depression DO NOT take Tramadol.   It will screw up your brain.  It’s been two weeks and I’m starting to feel happy again.,Justsayno

29,Tramadol,Fibromyalgia,7.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"February 16, 2018",29,Tramadol is pretty useless unless you have a anti-inflammatory with it. You can't take ibuprofen for years but you can for a while. I myself have found frankincense to be a magnificent anti-inflammatory. When it comes to not having any side effects at all. It reacts  with the Tramadol just like percocet has Tylenol in it. It actually works. I really didn't want percocet or any other narcotics like that I'm going to be forced to have a narcotic like Tramadol. Gabapentin and other nerve medications give me severe side effects. Try to frankincense and tramadol together. I even make my own I buy a bag of frankincense and put it in capsules so that there's no other ingredient in there. I take three capsules with the Tramadol. Now with severe fibromyalgia I can get away with 75 mg with frankincense.,MikeSchultz
