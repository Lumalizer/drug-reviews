0,Prednisone,Fibromyalgia,9.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"September 28, 2021",0,"I was diagnosed with fibromyalgia 4 years ago and have been in constant pain for 5 years. Despite being on Gabapentin, ibuprofen and cocodamol I had pain daily. I was out on prednisone for an unrelated eye issue and for the last 4 weeks have been pain free. It’s amazing, I feel like me before the fibromyalgia. I wake up in the morning and I feel good, I can walk the dog and ride my horse and go to the gym and hike and climb. I did all these things before but now I do then without the constant accompanying pain that is always there. I have 2 weeks left of the prednisone and I’m dreading being without it. I’ve had no side effects and have lost 6lbs in the last 3 weeks. I’m sleeping better, no increased appetite, nothing. I plan to ask my Dr is I can stay on a low dose and see if I can manage ok with it",Hevs

I have been to physical rehabilitation for 2.5 years and have got so baaddd that could not walk neither raise my hands anymore. So I had a leftover prednisone and it definitely helped with pain.

My rheumatologist said she thinks My PMR is in remission, however now I’m in pain all the time with my neck, hips, upperArms making it difficult to turn over in bed, feet so painful makes walking difficult, Etc.

It completely eliminated all my fibromyalgia symptoms, but only at the full dose, so only 2 of 6 days. Due to the severity of my symptoms, I spend all of my time either sleeping or sitting in my recliner. I am extremely disappointed and frustrated that neither my primary care physician nor my pain doctor will prescribe it for me. I could have a normal life with prednisone.

Recently I started getting severe aches and stiffness in my hands hips and feet. I could barely walk in AM, Coincidently I got a steriod shot in my foot for planar fasciatis--and all my pain and stiffness went away. After about 4 months it came back. I got a shot in the other foot for another type of pain, and again all my swollen joints and pain and stiffness went away. My rings would not come off until after the shot. After the second shot wore off, I went on prednisone. After  two days 10 mgs for 1, 40mgs for day two, my hands are back to normal, hip pain is gone, and muscle aches too. I can remove my rings again.I can bend easily, walk down stairs in AM easily. Sleep without waking from hip pain. It is working for me. I don't know if this means I may have RA or not.",Anonymous

I was bedridden and friends had to do everything for me.After trying a low dose , the improvement was very quick.However over the years I have gradually had to increase the dose to be able to function after being diagnosed with fibromyalgia and Hashimotos. I am presently on 10 mg per day and sometimes ( when I've got a virus or have overdone things) I increase to 12 or 15, but try and return to 10mg ASAP . My rheumatologist has said to try and reduce to 7 and a half mg.I am not overweight. And as far as I can tell I have not "" suffered"" from taking prednisolone.

I'm in a good mood, I have minimal pain, the only downside is your super hungry, but after a while that tapers off to.... prednisone is not the typical treatment for fibromyalgia that I highly recommend it!!!!! Since prednisone shuts down your own immune system you need to stay away from sick people, because most likely you'll catch it, and as you all know a normal cold is a horrendous ordeal for all of us!!!

Which ironed in the problem so it has been a living hell.  I begged my doctor to let me try steroid she said no, then a year later  she said she would give me a  trial. She offered me10 mg per day I said no 5 mg prednisolone will do! I now have 9 pain free hours per day, a lot less pain in the rest of the hours  its miraculous. I'm relaxed  less bothered about stuff I take it early morning  no problem sleeping,    I have got my life back. No misery just  pain free ability. I'm cross I wasn't offered this before as fibromyalgia has robbed me of half my life. I was living in absolute agony all over my body.

Pain is an issue however for me the most debilitating symptom is lethargy and mental fog. Well as you can imagine things pile up around me, tax needs doing, this needs to be done, garage needs cleaning etc. So I decided to go back onto prednisolone to do what needs to be done. I started 25mg for four days and after 2nd day felt great, energy less pain actually got stuff done. Now I am tapering (down to 15 today) and not really feeling great, hmmmm.Book an appointment with the doc today. Not overly hopeful but who knows.I think this will become my life now. Feel like rubbish most of the time, and when I need to get something done I will go onto a short burst or pred to get it done.The main drawbacks for me: insomnia (I don't sleep well most of the time anyway so this really kicks me), ravenous hunger (two breakfasts and three lunches...), and slight agitation.",Greg H

18,Prednisone,Fibromyalgia,6.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"June 17, 2019",23,I have been diagnosed with Fibromyalgia for over 6 years. It has gotten bad. I use a cane/walker. I struggle with daily life tasks. I fall and or lose balance a lot. Pain excruciating. Body locks up. Recently after a fall I had a lot of numbness because of inflammation pressing on nerves. Doctor prescribed me Prednisone. I have used it many times. It helps a tremendous amount with Fibromyalgia in general. Unfortunately and this is why I gave a lower rating. I have steroid-induced diabetes. I didn't know a thing about it. It is horrible and making me feel so sick. Now I feel the steroid isn't worth the complications it can give you. I pray that when I am done with the steroids that it will go away but very well can turn to full blown diabetes caused by steriods. I was never told this. After research I have found that this isn't so rare. So make sure you weigh the risk. I will only take steroids after this round as a last option. I have been so sick with this steroid-induced diabetes.,JJ

52,Prednisone,Fibromyalgia,8.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"May 26, 2015",47,"I've been suffering from fibromyalgia for over 10 years now..a few months ago I was stricken with Bell's palsy and was given a course of prednisone and Valtrex. Combined, it took away the palsy within a week but it also took away all my pain and stiffness. I've since learned that most people with Fibromyalgia have some type of herpes..herpes virus can also cause bell's palsy. There are many herpes viruses and not all show any outward symptoms. I highly suggest getting tested for all herpes viruses if you suffer from fibromyalgia. I'd bet dollars to donuts you have one type of herpes virus...like cold sores. The combo of low dose anti-inflammatory and the anti-viral is what works. I worked with my doc to find the lowest doses that worked.",Greenmama

I was prescribed prednisone for bronchitis and in one days time I was pain free and had energy thru the roof! I struggle a lot with daily things and not having strength or energy to do them. It's very depressing. I've considered asking my doctor to give it to me on a daily basis but I'm a little unsure. The bone weakening and weight gain concern me. Especially since I'm a mature women at age 42. Anyone that takes it, I ask do the pros outweigh the cons? Btw I'm a recovering addict. Was addicted to pain pills.
