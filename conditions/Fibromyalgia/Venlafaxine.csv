1,Venlafaxine,Fibromyalgia,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"October 31, 2021",1,"I suffer from fibromyalgia, osteoarthritis, anxiety and depression. I have probably been prescribed almost every available drug for chronic pain. You name it lyrica, cymbalta, amitriptyline and they didn't help and I had bad side effects. Doctor suggested weaning off Amitriptyline and taking Effexor in the morning. So I started on 37.5mg, felt a bit nauseas but it passed. Doctor then increased my dose to 75mg by that night after 8 years I was able to sit on a hard chair without my excruciating constant tailbone nerve pain. Its literally disappeared! My doctor then said to increase to 150mg and thats what I take now daily. I also eat less now, my other joint pain is still there but my main pain tailbone is 90% better. I have had chronic pain for many years and the tailbone nerve pain came from nowhere 8 years ago, wasn't from injury. I have read bad withdrawal experiences from Effexor but I don't care cause its helping my pain.",Cass

I’ve only been on it for 5 days and woke up this morning feeling normal for the first time in years . I’m not tired and the pain has completely gone for the first time ever , I’d forgotten how it feels to be normal .Also my mood was completely different and felt like my old self . Fingers crossed this continues . This is on only 37.5 mg and about to go up to the recommended dose of 75mg. Only thing I found is I’m better taking it at night as makes me sleepy and a bit dizzy.

Then came the blurry vision, urinary issues &  by day 10, the most debilitating stiff & painful back you can imagine. I knew it had to be related to the meds since this is NOT a Fibro symptom (at least for me) nor did I do anything to injure  myself. Before I discovered it was the meds I had gone to a walk in clinic (or hobble in clinic) & was given muscle relaxers. Nothing worked. Not ibuprofen, hot or cold compresses or muscle relaxers. After researching further I found that this medication can cause severe muscle stiffness.  I then asked my Dr.'s nurse if this was true and she said yes, she experienced it herself.",Not for me!

Also, a few people have mentioned that they fear getting off of it because of withdrawal.  Your doctor can help if you ever need to get off.  I believe the technical term is ""Effexor - Prozac bridge.""  In other words, you take the longer acting medication (like Prozac) to counteract the short half-life of Effexor.

I will never get off of Effexor, because it works and the withdrawal symptoms scare me to death.  I would only suggest  Effexor as a last resort and only for someone with long term issues because of the withdrawal problems.  Effexor is a lifetime commitment but it works so that's ok with me.  I did try other medications and honestly, the one thing I have learned to test if an antidepressant is going to work is if after a week of taking it whether there is sexual dysfunction or not.
