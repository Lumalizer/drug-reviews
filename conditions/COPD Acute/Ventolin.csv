0,Ventolin,COPD Acute,4,Taken for 5 to 10 years,"January 7, 2022",0,"I do not like the new containers where the mouthpiece comes totally off. No strength in my fingers from arthritis itâ€™s very hard for me to takeoff. And just like everybody else this does not help as good as it used to! Halfway through it being gone it actually stops working. Just like breathing  halfway through it being gone it actually stops working. Just like  inhaling air, about the last 80 doses it takes three or four hits off from it to even work a little.   Please go back to the old containers where the mouthpiece stays connected!!",SRJ.
1,Ventolin,COPD Acute,2,,"January 8, 2019",10,Have been on Pro Air and my insurance company did not want to provide it to me anymore. The provided Ventolin and from the first time I use it I could tell it was not the same. Does Not Work.  When you need a rescue inhaler you want to get relief in minutes not twenty minutes later. Most time I had to use four to five puffs and still no relief. They say it is the same medication but one works and the other does not. Pro Air # 1.,Slim
2,Ventolin,COPD Acute,10,Taken for less than 1 month,"January 30, 2013",44,I was prescribed for acute COPD. Since I've been using the inhaler I have had less flare-ups. I am able to breathe a lot better.,gr8kate
