0,Azithromycin,COPD Acute,1,Taken for less than 1 month,"September 9, 2019",3,Why does this medication cause chronic sinus pain? Sinus pain that is so severe it wakes me up in the night with a headache like a migraine. I had to stop taking it. Yet it is prescribed for sinusitis? Why would it effect my sinus so severely?,Fred
1,Azithromycin,COPD Acute,3,Taken for less than 1 month,"May 22, 2019",2,Zpack OMG!!! Took it once I got home from ER and 30 min later I've got stuff coming out both ends and just wanna lay on the bathroom floor. Hot baths or showers relieve the pain temporary. The abdominal pain and sweating is insane. My hubby thought I was dying it was scary!,Annie
2,Azithromycin,COPD Acute,8,,"March 31, 2016",8,"Before starting Azithromycin I was using a Nebulizer (4 times / day), Symbacort Inhaler (2 puffs, 2 times / day) and Spiriva, (1 / day), and used xxxxxx rescue Inhaler frequently, but still had difficulty getting enough air. Primary Care Physician recommended 1 pill of Azithromycin (250mg) / day. Immediately, I could breath much better, stopped the Nebulizer treatments all together and use Rescue Inhaler very infrequently. Chest feels much less congested. I wouldn't be able to function without it.",Finder8
3,Azithromycin,COPD Acute,1,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"March 13, 2016",5,"I was prescribed this about Nov 2014, 1 tablet a day.  After two weeks of being afraid to step over the doorway I stopped taking it, it caused severe stomach cramps, diarrhoea and nausea.  My consultant had prescribed it to take to try to stop me getting infections and possibly reduce my steroid intake (maintenance dose of 20mg per day, been on them daily since March 1992 for asthma).  Last month he persuaded me to try again but to take alternate days for a month and then if ok ask my GP to add to my prescription.  From the start the nausea, diarrhoea, stomach cramps came back, followed by itchiness, headache, shooting pain in right ear.  I have persevered for the month but will not be asking GP for more",shirl13
