0,ProAir HFA,COPD Acute,2,Taken for less than 1 month,"November 12, 2021",0,It is impossible to get the proper dose when you're not even sure that anything is coming out of it in the first place. It's not like other inhalers... there's no force of propellant behind each hit and if the counter weren't counting down you wouldn't think that anything came out of it at all. I am used to taking Ventolin: at least when I take it there's the sound of something rushing out of it and I can feel it pass through my mouth on its way down to my airways! With Proair there's none of that... it's like a dead inhaler. There's no satisfaction there at all in knowing that I got the right dose or any dose at all.,melparrishjr
1,ProAir HFA,COPD Acute,1,Taken for less than 1 month,"March 11, 2019",17,"I have Stage 4 COPD.I used Ventolin for several years until insurance company would no longer pay for it, I had to switch to Proair. What a waste of money. This rescue inhaler is a joke! This stuff is like using ""NOTHING"" at all. They need to take off the market ASAP before it kills someone who can not breathe. My Lung Doctor has to send a letter of ""Medical Necessity"" every year for me to be on it & them pay for my trusty Ventolin. Also Proair has ""Ethanol"" in it & needs to be taken off the market.",Spunky
2,ProAir HFA,COPD Acute,1,Taken for 5 to 10 years,"January 25, 2019",37,"I have been forced to use this horrible inhaler by my Insurance Company.  They stopped offering anything except this useless inhaler.  I WAS using Ventolin which worked great for me, but then got dropped.  ProAir clogs constantly and delivers spotty doses if any.  HATE this product - they must be giving the insurance companies a lot of kick-backs because it seems like most only offer this.  I want my Ventolin back!  I have a son-in-law who is from the Philippines.  He had to make a trip back there a couple of months ago, so while he was there he picked up 20 Ventolin inhalers for me (which is sold over the counter there with no script required) for $10 each!  We are getting so ripped off by the American pharma industry!  Something needs to change!",LaserLady
3,ProAir HFA,COPD Acute,1,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"September 16, 2018",21,"I have to say that this inhaler is nothing but a joke, perpetrated by the manufacturer. First, the medicine is never effective! Second, the delivery system constantly clogs and you have to soak it and wait for it too dry. Last, the counter does not work right. More than half the time it just does not work because something is wrong with the delivery system and will not be replaced by the manufacturer! That they make you go without is a crime against every user! This product should be outlawed! This is a very poor inhaler! I do not recommend anyone to use this product. If your Doctor prescribes it ask for a different one! If I could have given a rating of minus 10 I would have!",Really
4,ProAir HFA,COPD Acute,8,Taken for 5 to 10 years,"June 1, 2016",16,Inhaler clogs and does not deliver meds.  Pharmacist says they work and gave them back to me.,Anonymous
5,ProAir HFA,COPD Acute,8,Taken for 5 to 10 years,"September 19, 2013",31,"I have been using this medicine for many years and it really works for me. I walk everywhere, and going up hills it really comes in handy. I however do not like the new design, it tells you how much you have used, which is the good part, but the bad part is it clogs up too easily. The old one clogs as well, but takes longer to do it. I personally have not noticed any side effect of this medicine. The old albuterol inhalers made my heart race, this one does not.",Divine1
