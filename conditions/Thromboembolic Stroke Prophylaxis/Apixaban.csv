He had been on Coumadin for many years, never had any issues. He had a stroke on 12/3/20 and was in ICU, treated with heparin. On Dec 10, they started him on Eliquis. The evening of 12/11, he had a massive GI bleed. By 12/12, he was dead. Has anyone else out there had issues with treatment with this drug for stroke?",Maryb
1,Apixaban,Thromboembolic Stroke Prophylaxis,10.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"February 2, 2020",24,"Eliquis (apixaban):I am on Eliquis for stroke prevention, having had two separate strokes of unknown cause in my thirties. I've been on Eliquis for over three years and have had no issues with it! I bruise much more easily, yes, and I bleed more heavily when injured or during my period, but otherwise, there's been no negatives to it. I do find I can't tolerate alcohol or caffeine, their effects seen to be greatly magnified since being on the drug, but these are small concessions to make for myself!",Moni

5,Apixaban,Thromboembolic Stroke Prophylaxis,7.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"March 26, 2018",8,Diagnosed with atrial fibrillation after unexpectedly having a stroke aged 73 though fit and active. Recovered well with some loss of feeling in right hand; put on apixaban on discharge from hospital and since then have never felt well. Nine months after having the stroke I still have regular giddy spells and have no appetite - I just feel old and frail. Is it the medication or after effect of stroke. My instinct is that it is the medication but I don't want to have another stroke so I keep on taking it.,Liz
6,Apixaban,Thromboembolic Stroke Prophylaxis,1.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"December 5, 2017",36,"Eliquis (apixaban):I had a stroke (Lacunar Infarct left side of pons area ) and was placed on Eliquis 5 mg twice per day.  I began itching head to toe since April 2017.  I looked up the side effects tonight and found this site.  I am stopping this medication starting tonight!  I can’t wait  to stop ITCHING!! My skin feels like sandpaper.  I feel like I have been wearing a wool body suit.  Inside my ear canals are itching. I thought my stroke brought on cataracts-  no this drug did.  I am also suffering from insomnia and what do you know, it’s from this drug.  Restless leg syndrome, confusion, I can go on and on.  I’m stopping this drug now and will let my doc know.  I do thank Eliquis for giving me the coupon to purchase this drug for $10.00/mo.  But so sorry it is not for me.",SharonG53

Has Implantable Cardioverter Defibrillator  (ICD), stomach problems and prostate cancer in past. He had developed a Blood clot behind ICD.He deteriorated within 3 days of taking this drug, couldn't walk and bleeding out through back passage, kidneys and we don't know where else as still waiting for test results. His lactate levels 7.3 on admittance to hospital; a sustained 5 has a survival rate of only 11% so dad lucky thus far.He has received 4 units of blood, oxygen, saline solution to try to flush it out. This medication must be administered with caution, looking at previous conditions and closely monitored. My dad deteriorated within 72 of starting it. The external symptoms are: listlessness, waxy skin, breathing difficulties, paralysis of lower limbs.",Liz71
