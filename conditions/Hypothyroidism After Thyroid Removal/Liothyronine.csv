1,Liothyronine,Hypothyroidism After Thyroid Removal,2.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"July 26, 2020",12,"I just brought my sister to the ER because she wanted to kill herself. Ever since she started this drug a week ago, after her thyroid was removed, she has had tremors, headaches, sweats, vomiting, and severe depression. She lost all energy and could not sleep. She only took 2.5 mg. They admitted her to the psych  floor and will keep her for a week.  This is a powerful drug that needs close monitoring.",Sister
2,Liothyronine,Hypothyroidism After Thyroid Removal,1.0,,"August 31, 2019",66,"Cytomel (liothyronine):I have had Hashimoto's hypothyroidism for 40 years. I was on generic levothyroxine for most of that time. As I reached 50 my new endocrinologist decided I should add 5mcg (of very potent) T3 aka Cytomel to my 150mcg of levothyroxine. Initially like many patients I felt great, then it got real bad. I am sorry, I know some people do very well on it, BUT many do not.Here is what I experienced in order of severity-Super dark ThoughtsSevere DepressionRageRapidly Cycling MoodsFacial SwellingExtreme ItchingNighttime CoughingIntense MigrainesInsomniaHeat IntoleranceDilated Neck VeinsExtreme FatigueHot Flashes with the Inability to SweatIf you experience any or all of these You Are Not Alone and You Are NOT Crazy!",Laurie B
3,Liothyronine,Hypothyroidism After Thyroid Removal,10.0,Taken for 10 years or more,"August 19, 2019",18,I had half my thyroid removed.  Levothyroxine on it's own was not working so my primary care doc combined it with two 5 mcg liothyronine once daily 4 days a week and one tab all other days.  I felt like I was going to crawl out of my skin and anxiety through the roof! He told me to take it all in the morning and that I did not need to split the daily dose because my body would regulate absorption.  I decided to go to an endocrinologist who did not change the amount but had me take one tab in the morning with my levo and the 2nd tab in the evening but not too close to bed time. On the days where I take only one pill she had me split it in half and take half in morning and other half in evening.  This worked like a charm!  Since we've adjusted to it to where I take two tabs 3 days per week and one tab 4 days per week.  I no longer split the one tab because it would crumble and take it in the morning but I'm still feeling great!,Kimiko
4,Liothyronine,Hypothyroidism After Thyroid Removal,,Taken for less than 1 month,"August 6, 2019",10,"I had complete Thyroidectomy in 2012 and was put on Synthroid 175mcgs. My TSH was completely suppressed which is fine, no issues. But I could not lose the weight and still felt fatigued. Last week I asked to have Cytomel added to my Synthroid. This new doctor ( I had moved to another state) dropped my Synthroid from 175mcgs to 137mcgs and added 10 of Cytomel. It has been a week and I feel HORRIBLE. I asked the doctor to up the Synthroid to at least 150mcg and she refused. I am finding a different Endocrinologist. I want to give Cytomel a fighting chance but the drop in Synthroid was far too much too quick.",Kasey
5,Liothyronine,Hypothyroidism After Thyroid Removal,10.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"July 10, 2019",111,"Cytomel (liothyronine):Changed my life.  On Synthroid only felt exhausted and totally dysfunctional.  Adding Cytomel improved my well-being, mood and energy level.  It does have a greater reducing factor on your TSH.  But so what.  I do not have a thyroid, my bones and cardiac function are fine and I feel normal.  Endocrinologists often feel that adding T3 is not necessary.  They need to change their thinking.",Mieke
6,Liothyronine,Hypothyroidism After Thyroid Removal,,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"June 16, 2019",36,"Cytomel (liothyronine):Cytomel is causing debilitating symptoms such as severe muscle cramps/spasms and muscle pain, insomnia, ravenous appetite, profuse sweating, palpitations.  When I stopped taking it, I got better.  I tried to reintroduce it and to my horror, the severe spasms returned. The prescribed muscle relaxers hardly work.  The endocrinologist said my symptoms are not related to the prescribed medication or to my thyroid condition!! I disagree.  I've had problems with Armour in the distant past.  For some reason, I can't take cytomel or armour long term.",Sammycat
7,Liothyronine,Hypothyroidism After Thyroid Removal,10.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"June 10, 2019",101,"Cytomel (liothyronine):An endocrinologist put me on the (50 mg) day post TT. I felt tremendous. Then my insurance changed and I had to find a new doctor. The new doctor refused to prescribe Cytomel. So for several years I’ve been on Synthroid 200 and 300 and then Nature Throid 3 grains. The Nature Thyroid won out over the Synthroid by far. But my total T3 and FT3 were still tanked. I began seeing a functional medicine doctor who suggested T3 only medication. WHAT A LIFE CHANGER! I take 25 mg/day. Gone is the anxiety, mood swings, depression, weight gain, brain fog and insomnia. I feel like a brand new person at 62. My doctor follows my labs closely and all thyroid levels are in range (FT3 upper range, FT4 mid range). I highly recommend trying this mono therapy if you don’t have a thyroid gland and other medication regimens have failed.",Tiny
8,Liothyronine,Hypothyroidism After Thyroid Removal,8.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"October 3, 2018",13,"I have been on dual therapy BRAND NAME ONLY Synthroid and Cytomel for 2 years after battling hypo symptoms, dosages and generics for 12 previous years. NBO Cytomel is unavailable evidently until 2/19 so I started generic liothyronine (Signapharm) about 6 days ago. Awoke 2 days ago with terrible hives/rash all over and severe and very scary facial swelling.  Urgent care gave me steroid injection and suggested Benedryl which helped immensely but symptoms lingering. Totally at sea now as to what to do. Might try another generic as that seems logical and I know from previous episode that without T3 for very long I'll crash face first.",Teebird
9,Liothyronine,Hypothyroidism After Thyroid Removal,10.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"June 10, 2018",12,"My doctor had me on levothyroxine (once a day) and liothyronine (1/2 tablet 2 x a day). I switched health care providers (nurse practitioner) and she reduced the levothyroxine, cut the liothyronine completely. I've gained weight and am extremely tired. I thought it was the heart med and blood thinner they put me on. After reading this about all of you, it may be because she drastically reduced the meds. I am seeing a new doctor now, and hopefully, she will add back the liothyronine after checking my blood. I have been drinking caffeine to be able to function, which I am not supposed to do because of my heart.",Goddess of dreams

When my endocrinologist took me off of TSH suppression by lowering my dose of T4 I was miserable.  Within in weeks I was exhausted, cold all the time, had brain fog, was depressed, and needed additional sleep.  When I told my endocrinologist she continued to lower my dose (twice) because my TSH was suppressed.  This caused me to be completely disfunctional at work and at home...I was so exhausted and everwhelmed I feared losing my job and my husband (no libido for over 6 months) and low productivity at work.  I begged my endocrinologist to add T3.  The dose was too low at first to make a difference but after reestablishing with a new",Dana#

14,Liothyronine,Hypothyroidism After Thyroid Removal,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"November 3, 2013",33,"After thyroid removal, the horrible experience of synthroid, and finally getting on natural desiccated thyroid, I had to switch to t3 temporarily due to my rt3 being too high. The conversion was fairly easy, but a bit taxing on my adrenals. I had to be more careful of stressful situations for a little while. Overall, I am very happy with the t3 and may just stay with it. Although, dosing four times a day is tedious.",Mocristy
15,Liothyronine,Hypothyroidism After Thyroid Removal,9.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"July 1, 2012",229,"Cytomel (liothyronine):I had my thyroid removed 3 years ago. I have been on various T4 supplements since: Synthroid, levothyroxine, Tirosint and continued to complain of fatigue, fogginess, wt gain, achiness, shortness of breath at exercise. FINALLY switched doctors as my Indian doctor would not try Armour. The new nurse practitioner looked at my labs: high T4, nonexistent T3. She switched me back to Synthroid and decreased the dosage, then added, for the FIRST time, Cytomel (T3). Within 3 days I have noticed a HUGE difference. So happy and still know the time test. BUT, fog is lifting, energy level increasing, sleeping well, HAPPY. I am hoping this continues. Noticed a slight headache at first but not bad. Will continue to cautiously be excited that we are ON to something.",Bigi
16,Liothyronine,Hypothyroidism After Thyroid Removal,5.0,,"August 8, 2011",19,"After diagnosis of Grave's Disease I was given Synthroid. Took this alone for 20 years. Dosage was lowered from 0.150 to 0.125 when thought to be causing irregular heart beat. Had an ""oblation"" of nerves around heart area that was causing irregular beating and remained on 0.125 dosage feeling better. A new Endocrinologist had me add Liothyronine in a custom ""compound"" dosage of 2.5mcg and lowered Synthroid to 0.112.  One measurement was high the other low hoping to balance the two. Didn't feel a lot of improvement. Noticed I was more irritable with upset stomach. Tried it for 2 months but quit- wasn't happy with it.  I've started taking it again and have small improvements in mental clarity, regularity, but get migraines.",pending judgement
