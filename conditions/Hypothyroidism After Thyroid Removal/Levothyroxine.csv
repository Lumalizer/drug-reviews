After taking this meds for just a short time, l thought I would end up in the ER. I called Walmart pharmacy and let them know that l didn’t appreciate that they substituted this rubbish and demanded they refill my original med levothyroxine. They claimed that my doctor said it was okay and l have not confirmed that yet with my doctor but l will. Walmart did not seem interested in my life and they could not answer me when l told them they didn’t let me know they changed my meds.

1,Levothyroxine,Hypothyroidism After Thyroid Removal,1.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"March 18, 2022",0,"Euthyrox (levothyroxine):This stuff is awful. Had thyroid removed November 17th, 2022. It took a while to get my levels normal.  When they finally were normal I felt terrible. Chest pains, anxiety, go from cold to burning up, insomnia, loss of focus and so much more. Through the grace of God I found this website.  Dr immediately change my medication when I showed him what I found. It is really bad and makes you feel out of control because you can't slow your heart down or do anything about the anxiety.  I have been off of it for 3 days and I am praying the side effects go away soon. If you are having these problems take a deep breath and give yourself a break. Exercise was the only thing that would help, but the chest pain, fast heartbeat and anxiety would come right back. Tell the people around you so they can give you a break. It makes everything really hard and the smallest thing will frustrate you and then you fill worse. Try to remember it's the medicine and not you and it will get better.",Carley

Hospital after hospital, doctor after doctor. extremely horrible chest pains every single day was the main symptom, but tiredness, constipation, appetite problems, etc. finally my doctor found I had an extremely under active thyroid with my ranges being in the 1,000’s. She put me on 25mg levothryoxine. At first, it actually made me feel worse. really sluggish, my blood pressure was high if I drink any caffeine through out the day with the medicine. It took about 4-5 weeks for it to actually kick it and now it feel completely normal again. It’s such an amazing feeling. I can drink caffeine now without it counteracting with the medicine. I suggest taking it really really early in the morning and don’t eat for an hour after or drink anything, also take it on a slightly empty stomach.",Hypothyroidism

So, I said screw it and obliged to Euthyrox. Just like my experience in the past to switching thyroids meds, I had every reason to believe this would make my thyroid to go completely bonkers and I had even prepared to get labs done frequently. And to my surprise, my labs have stayed normal and has even improved by a few decimals. Note to patients: get labs done frequently whenever switching thyroid medications. Better yet, try not to switch at all. But if you have to, get labs done as much as you can. I wish doctors and pharmacists made their patients aware that switching different brands and generics can cause some issues. Do your due diligence and you'll be fine. I'm actually glad to be taking Euthyrox, an actual brand-name drug for the price of a cheaper generic. The blister packaging is great.",christianm

I think I've been put on every dosage there is.  I have not felt the same since. I'm always tired, I wake up wanting to rip someones head off, armpits sweat horribly, cry over nothing, depressed, hair loss, always colder or hotter then people around me, no energy etc. but when I talk to my doctor and explain my issues I'm told that I'm fine. (I beg to differ, needless to say I'm going to see a new doctor next visit).  Though I'm sure Synthroid is a wonderful medication, it just doesn't seem to be working for me in my opinion... my doctor seems to think different.",Anonymous

My doctor put me on the Levothyroxine, but I struggle with constant fatigue and insomnia. I changed to Armour Thyroid a few months ago and noticed considerable improvements-- not only in my fatigue and energy levels, but in my mood. I struggle with depression while I'm on the levothyroxine, but I don't on the Armour Thyroid. Also, on the Armour Thyroid, my skin and hair were much healthier, my appetite and gastrointestinal system more regular, and what an incredible thing it was to actually sleep! I have had to go back to the Levothyroxine because of problems getting the Armour thyroid (it's on backorder). I have insomnia again and I'm always miserably tired.",M.R
