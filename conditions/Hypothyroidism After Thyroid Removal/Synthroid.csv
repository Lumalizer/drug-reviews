1,Synthroid,Hypothyroidism After Thyroid Removal,7.0,,"November 22, 2020",5,"I had large thyroid nodules and was advised to have a Thyroidectomy which I did 5 months. It seem that it is hard to adjust my dosage of thyroxine which started at 11/mcg, 88 mcg and now down to 50mcg’s . I was told that my thyroxine level was low? Is this usually normal after having a Thyroidectomy.  The nodules were benign.",Jossie
2,Synthroid,Hypothyroidism After Thyroid Removal,10.0,Taken for 10 years or more,"September 20, 2020",3,"Synthroid in high doses can precipitate hyperthyroidism and in severe cases thyroid storm, cardiac shock, severe tremor, etc.  It is often given with other medications which interact such as lithium, and therefore some chemical synchrony and finesse would be required.  Mistakes can be avoided that way.  The opposite of course is hypothyroidism.  I hope we can have a collaboration between chemists and doctors in polypharmacy.  Experience has taught me quite a bit.  Cheers",mmmousemaid

4,Synthroid,Hypothyroidism After Thyroid Removal,1.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"December 28, 2019",64,I had a total thyroidectomy in 2016 after being on thyroid pills for ten years for hyperthyroidism and graves . I also had huge nodules and tumors. After surgery I started on a low dose of Levothyroxine and without even reading my blood work after surgery my Endocronolgy doctor changed my meds I felt fine and wasn’t gaining weight . Then he kept changing it and I started gaining . I went from 90 lbs to 155 lbs in three years and I barely even eat . My current thyroid doctor won’t do a full thyroid panel nor change my dose-age and ignoring my symptoms. I felt better at 125 mcg of Levothyroxine because I was able to lose but he put me back on 100 . I barely eat and get exercise yet I still can’t lose and keep gaining it’s very frustrating.,Cookie

I can only speak to my situation. I  had my thyroid ablated about 5 years ago. It was absolutely the right & necessary thing for me. I am currently taking 88mcg Synthroid, daily. It works great for me. I'm extremely sensitive to meds, so my dr opted to start me on a low dose & check my levels every month until I  got a ""normal"" result. It took a few months. I now am tested every year, but also go by how I'm feeling. My dr is very understanding. FIND A GOOD DR. This med has worked great for me.

After all the tests, I was put on Levothyroxine generic. I had all the symptoms named in all the other comments. But to come to find out, I couldn't take the generic. I was switched to synthroid and have been on it for over 30 years. I had to get it adjusted correctly, over the years,  finally got it settled. All the symptoms gradually went away and I have been doing great since. This one has done the job for me. The only thing I have to say is that once on this medication, the weight maintenance has been constant with good diet and exercise. I have always separated vitamins and thyroid med, vitamins in the morning and meds at night. It has worked so far and feeling great. I will continue on this medication. To all, do not give up.
