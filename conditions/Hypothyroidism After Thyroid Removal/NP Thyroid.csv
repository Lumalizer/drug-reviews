1,NP Thyroid,Hypothyroidism After Thyroid Removal,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"October 11, 2021",5,I began NP a couple of weeks ago.  The third day I developed bad headaches and was dizzy.  This past weekend my BP soared and began having heart palpitations.  I stopped it today and this evening I am beginning to improve.  I will never take NP again.,Thyroid Gal

3,NP Thyroid,Hypothyroidism After Thyroid Removal,9.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"December 26, 2020",6,I have been on NP for several years. I did notice the change in smell about a year ago. Which I thought odd everyone used the exact words to describe it.  I am optimal in NP. I have not had any problems. I do take a 240 mg a day or 4 grains. My doctor is very on top of thyroid problems. I would not jump to take Armour because a website claims it’s the only thing that works.,Vickie3766
4,NP Thyroid,Hypothyroidism After Thyroid Removal,7.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"May 31, 2020",27,"I just switched back to Armour after being on NP Thyroid for years. I only switched to NP because my insurance will not cover Armour. Starting around summer 2019 I began experiencing lots of acid reflux, nausea, pain in my stomach that would last for days. I began seeing a GI thinking I had an ulcer or something. I had an upper scope done in Feb 2020 only to be told that everything was fine. I finally put it together that I felt fine until about 20-30 mins after I took my pill. I asked my doctor to switch me back to Armour and my stomach hasn’t hurt since. There is definitely something off with NP.",Melissa
5,NP Thyroid,Hypothyroidism After Thyroid Removal,1.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"March 28, 2020",24,"I kept feeling bloated at the top part of my tummy. I had heart palpitations then realized that they changed my medication from Armour Thyroid to NP thyroid. I actually just stopped taking it. I know I probably shouldn't but with Covid 19 and no doctors app. in sight, I just wanted to feel better and I do! I thought I'd start taking Armour again and called the doctors office and much to my surprise they called it in. I checked online with the pharmacy and it's NP Thyroid! Omg are you kidding me? I have to call the pharmacy tomorrow and see about changing to Armour again. Geeesh! I used to take NP fine until several months ago.",Momma T

7,NP Thyroid,Hypothyroidism After Thyroid Removal,1.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"December 5, 2019",40,I agree something is wrong with NP thyroid. The smell/taste of my last prescription is awful. I’ve been on the same dose for over a year with no issues and at my last physical my TSH went from 1 in June to over 10 in November and I do not have a thyroid gland anymore. Something is wrong with this medicine.,Owl
8,NP Thyroid,Hypothyroidism After Thyroid Removal,3.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"November 29, 2019",34,I have been taking NP thyroid For about 2 1/2 years. I have no thyroid it was removed due to cancer many years ago. I always thought it tasted nasty and smelled bad. But it had worked very well up until August 2019. I have gained 7 pounds unexplainably. I am super careful about my diet low carbs healthy etc. Please whatever you have done as a company change the dynamics back on the NP thyroid. It once worked!,Psalmist
9,NP Thyroid,Hypothyroidism After Thyroid Removal,1.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"November 27, 2019",32,"I was on Synthroid for 14 years after my thyroidectomy (thyroid cancer). My body stopped absorbing Synthroid medicine. My dr prescribed NP Thyroid & I figured, great something new and I’ll finally feel better. The exact opposite happened. I had diarrhea for 2 months every single day (I’ve never had stomach issues), Heart palpitations & I was tired all the time. Talked with my dr this week & we checked my levels. My T3 & T4 we’re dangerously low. For 2 months the medication didn’t work at all.  I called the pharmaceutical company today to put in a complaint & am waiting for someone to call me on a recorded line. It’s alarming to read all of these comments and hear that we all have similar issues. I’m a working mother who needs to have my medicine to function. I’ve missed work, sporting events & time with my family. Please look into these ingredients, fix them or remove this medication from the market.",Anonymous
10,NP Thyroid,Hypothyroidism After Thyroid Removal,1.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"October 10, 2019",56,"I started on levothyroxine. It never helped, so I switched to NP thyroid. I felt more energized and didn’t fall asleep everywhere. Recently, I started to feel tired again, falling asleep at stop lights, feeling bloated, even if I didn’t eat, feel like I can’t catch my breath, increased anxiety, and I have this pain in my right side of my neck I’ve never had before. I noticed when I got my refill of NP thyroid Sept 2019, the color, smell, and taste was noticeably different. All these new symptoms started with this new prescription, nothing else has changed. The drug company may claim it’s still as high of standard as before even with their new supplier, but clearly something is wrong if many people have the same experience I have. Let’s make this about helping your patients feel better instead of any other reason that’s been concocted; go back to the old version. I’ll be switching to something different, because NP thyroid is no longer a product worth buying.",Kins
11,NP Thyroid,Hypothyroidism After Thyroid Removal,3.0,,"October 1, 2019",58,"I have been on the NP thyroid medication for almost 7 years. I did pretty well on it.  About 3 months ago I started feeling really really bad. To the point where I had to go different doctors to figure it out why suddenly I was feeling so bad. Well, thousands of dollars of testings later everything is fine with me but still feel like garbage. Then I came across this page and it all made sense. The NP thyroid medication no longer looks or smells the same. I have proof, I found an old bottle of the same strength and compared the two. Something changed and now I will have to figure out what I will need to change  so I can feel normal again. Shame on you NP Thyroid- Acella for messing up something that worked just fine, but most importantly messing with people's life and well-being. Own up to it!!!!!",Kata

Good afternoon Antoinette,Thank you for contacting us and we are here to listen to all comments and concerns.  Consumers are of the utmost importance in everything that we do.  We recently changed our API suppliers to an FDA inspected and regulated source in Europe, but all of our manufacturing still takes place in the U.S.  With this change, you may notice slight cosmetic and/odor variances that are no cause for concern.  Our formulation has and will remain consistent, along with our exacting quality standards that undergo rigorous testing to maintain the T3 and T4 always remain within the specifications by the USP.   Please don't hesitate to contact us with any comments or concerns""  I haven't had any symptoms return just yet...anyone else taste cat urine but feeling ok?",Netty

14,NP Thyroid,Hypothyroidism After Thyroid Removal,3.0,Taken for 10 years or more,"September 16, 2019",35,"I have been on thyroid for 15 years. 8 years before thyroid removal, 7 years after. I started with synthroid at the beginning, I felt normal. Then it was difficult to get synthroid and switched to Nature thyroid. Was on that for a very longtime, made me feel better, no headaches, didn’t fluctuate in weight, then the money hungry pharmaceutical companies decided that we didn’t pay enough for our WORKING thyroid medicine and didn’t make enough. So, I switched to np. Now I am back to being fatigued all the time, migraines AGAIN, weight gain, brain fog, cramps in my legs, the list goes on. When are these pharmaceuticals going to be accountable for screwing with the well being of 100s of thousands of people.",Delta Dawn
15,NP Thyroid,Hypothyroidism After Thyroid Removal,1.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"September 1, 2019",37,"Was okay. Not like WP, but I was getting my life back after the RLC debacle. Now, in August 2019, they changed it. Of course Acella denies it, but you cannot argue with the pill physically changing and smells of ammonia. They almost seem like they have been tainted. All hypo symptoms returned with a vengeance on just one day of this non-reformulated formulation. Just trying to swallow the pills caused burns on my tongue, throat, stomach and intestines.",Not Happy
16,NP Thyroid,Hypothyroidism After Thyroid Removal,,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"August 30, 2019",17,Just got new script and it smells and taste horrible . Terrible aftertaste . Brushing teeth don’t even help . Took one dose this morning . Calling pharmacy and doctor as soon as they open .,Cucan2
17,NP Thyroid,Hypothyroidism After Thyroid Removal,,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"August 6, 2019",33,"I’ve been using Acella for a couple years. My new bottle of 60’s (has to sub the 60’s for 120’s because of backorder) tasted and smelled like INSECTICIDE! I took it anyway for a week. I had hypothyroid symptoms come back with a vengeance (yes, I took 2 pills).  I reported my concerns to my pharmacy and they told me they had just that day received in some 120’s. So they sent me the 120’s and guess what? They taste and smell like INSECTICIDE too!! What gives? Side note: I stopped the horrible 60’s and took the few remaining 120’s of a prior bottle and felt 100% better plus they didn’t smell and taste like insecticide. We shall see how this new bottle of 120 insecticide pills control my hypothyroidism.",Sandy toes
18,NP Thyroid,Hypothyroidism After Thyroid Removal,1.0,,"March 15, 2019",22,"TSH went up from 1.3 to 12.8 while taking NP thyroid. It did nothing for me but cause terrible brain fog, joint pain, stomach issues, etc.  Going back to Levothyroxine and going to add small amount of T3.",Punker
19,NP Thyroid,Hypothyroidism After Thyroid Removal,1.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"February 8, 2019",25,"Walmart pharmacy substituted NP for Armour thyroid. It makes me very depressed, sleepless and fatigue.  It makes me angry because they did this without my permission after I told them before that I didn’t want NP because of the same issues before.  I would avoid NP!!!!",DorrieL
20,NP Thyroid,Hypothyroidism After Thyroid Removal,2.0,,"December 4, 2018",38,"Like most with the WP/naturethroid shortage, was switched to this drug back in 2017. On it 4 months; 120mg/2 grains in am, & 30mg/a half grain in the afternoon. Managed to get back on naturethyroid right when it became available again in early 2018,  not the greatest as they reformulated it and my levels were low but at least no side effects. When my prescription for it ran out recently I had no insurance to see my dr. again yet, and so had no choice but to take something I already had on hand. This time, after 6 hours of taking the first dose of np I experienced the most profound sadness/deep depression, complete with crying spells. It lasted for hours, I was in bed crying my eyes out for no apparent reason. Not like me! And that’s not all. Headache, dizziness, anxiety, heart pounding, feeling like I was going to pass out, diarrhea, vision problems, confusion/disorientation/brain fog, no appetite, wired but tired feeling, shortness of breath...what a list, good grief!",Amers
21,NP Thyroid,Hypothyroidism After Thyroid Removal,,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"August 30, 2018",30,"I've been taking NP Thyroid for the last 6 months and am completely happy with it. It reminds me of what Naturethroid was when I was taking it after getting off Synthroid following a thyroidectomy. Prior to NP I was given the generic version of NP which is Levothyroxine/Liothyronine and felt terrible on it..it reminded me of Synthroid.  They were both terrible, the generic version of NP and Synthroid both make my hands and legs swell up, I gained weight on both. If you are on the generic version of NP then you are NOT taking NP by Acella. I was also on Naturethroid after getting off Synthroid and did great on it, even lost half the weight I gained while on Synthroid and felt 100% better within just months of being on it and then a shortage occured and thats when I had to switch over to NP.  I definitely feel as good as I did when I was on Naturethroid.",Mimi
22,NP Thyroid,Hypothyroidism After Thyroid Removal,1.0,,"August 16, 2018",33,"I never write reviews, but want to share my experience with NP Thyroid by Acella. I have many of the same problems listed here already. I have taken thyroid replacement for 20 years.I had been on Armour for years, my dosage is closely monitored as my blood levels fluctuate a lot. My doctor switched my dosage and the pharmacy filled it with the generic NP Thyroid instead of Armour. We have new health insurance. I decided to try it, maybe it would help keep my levels more steady. Three weeks in and this is the worst I have ever felt mentally. I have never been so depressed in my life. I have dealt with anxiety, but this is different; hopeless, weepy with a dark depression. I have gained over 10 pounds and all I want to do is sleep. The confusion and brain fog are almost scary; I can't remember or figure out simple things I do every day.Maybe if I could give it more time, my body would 'adjust', but I had to call my doctor to go back to Armour. There is no way I could take the NP another day.",Anonymous
23,NP Thyroid,Hypothyroidism After Thyroid Removal,,,"February 3, 2018",4,"I became hypothyroid after radiation treatment.  I ma still unsure, but I think natural thyroid med is better brain-fog wise, but I experience energy levels yo-yo~ing. I feel lethargic ",lynni-boo
24,NP Thyroid,Hypothyroidism After Thyroid Removal,8.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"December 22, 2015",22,I have only 1 lobe of thyroid after having a weird mass.  For 2yrs the thyroid seemed to do ok.  Then bamm I became underactive.  I flat out told my Dr NO synthetics.  I wanted to try Amour.  I have been taking NP Thyroid for almost 3 weeks.  I do feel somewhat better but have noticed an extreme swing in my mood for a hour or so after taking it.  Also I feel like I wanna eat like there is no tomorrow,GracieGurlee
