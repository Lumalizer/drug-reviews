0,Euthyrox,Hypothyroidism After Thyroid Removal,1,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"March 21, 2022",0,"Walmart switched my med to euthyroid.  This medicine should not be on the market and should be banned. Before you take this meds, please be aware that l experienced body aches, headaches, rapid heartbeat, itching, brain fog, sleeplessness, just to start. After taking this meds for just a short time, l thought I would end up in the ER. I called Walmart pharmacy and let them know that l didn’t appreciate that they substituted this rubbish and demanded they refill my original med levothyroxine. They claimed that my doctor said it was okay and l have not confirmed that yet with my doctor but l will. Walmart did not seem interested in my life and they could not answer me when l told them they didn’t let me know they changed my meds. There has to be something we can do to stop this horrible meds from hurting people.",Anonymous
1,Euthyrox,Hypothyroidism After Thyroid Removal,1,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"March 18, 2022",0,"This stuff is awful. Had thyroid removed November 17th, 2022. It took a while to get my levels normal.  When they finally were normal I felt terrible. Chest pains, anxiety, go from cold to burning up, insomnia, loss of focus and so much more. Through the grace of God I found this website.  Dr immediately change my medication when I showed him what I found. It is really bad and makes you feel out of control because you can't slow your heart down or do anything about the anxiety.  I have been off of it for 3 days and I am praying the side effects go away soon. If you are having these problems take a deep breath and give yourself a break. Exercise was the only thing that would help, but the chest pain, fast heartbeat and anxiety would come right back. Tell the people around you so they can give you a break. It makes everything really hard and the smallest thing will frustrate you and then you fill worse. Try to remember it's the medicine and not you and it will get better.",Carley
2,Euthyrox,Hypothyroidism After Thyroid Removal,1,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"February 22, 2022",1,"I do love the internet for this type of communication.  Wal-Mart switched me back in late November 21 to Euthyrox. By late December I thought I was going to need my prostate removed.  Body aches, joint aches, fatigue and brain fog to boot.  Do not let happen to you.  Back on levothyroxine and after 2 days, everything improved.",DCG

5,Euthyrox,Hypothyroidism After Thyroid Removal,1,Taken for less than 1 month,"January 4, 2022",2,"Within just a few days of taking this brand of medicine I broke out in head to toe hives, rapid heart rate and trouble breathing. I’ve been on the generic for levothyroxine from Walgreens and Krogers for years with no issue. Had to get a steroid injection from dr and she immediately called in a new prescription to Walgreens for levothyroxine.  I’ve filed with the FDA and will be talking to Walmart tomorrow, who is who switched me to this horrible medication. After reading these reviews I know I’m not crazy for how bad this medicine made me feel.",JRR
6,Euthyrox,Hypothyroidism After Thyroid Removal,1,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"December 6, 2021",1,"Had my thyroid removed in 2006, and have been taking Levothyroxine for years with no issues.   Walmart recently switched me to Euthyrox.   Just had my labs done and my TSH level was 20!  Warning to everyone, do NOT take this medicine!",hcat
7,Euthyrox,Hypothyroidism After Thyroid Removal,10,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"November 5, 2021",3,"I was switched to Euthyrox (Walmart Pharmacy) because I guess their contract ended with a different generic and it was becoming increasingly difficult to get those ordered every month. So, I said screw it and obliged to Euthyrox. Just like my experience in the past to switching thyroids meds, I had every reason to believe this would make my thyroid to go completely bonkers and I had even prepared to get labs done frequently. And to my surprise, my labs have stayed normal and has even improved by a few decimals. Note to patients: get labs done frequently whenever switching thyroid medications. Better yet, try not to switch at all. But if you have to, get labs done as much as you can. I wish doctors and pharmacists made their patients aware that switching different brands and generics can cause some issues. Do your due diligence and you'll be fine. I'm actually glad to be taking Euthyrox, an actual brand-name drug for the price of a cheaper generic. The blister packaging is great.",christianm
8,Euthyrox,Hypothyroidism After Thyroid Removal,1,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"November 4, 2021",2,Total thyroidectomy in 2017. Been taking levothyroxine for 3 with years with normal and consistent labs showing therapeutic TSH suppression. The Walmart pharmacy switched me to Euthyrox and it was not therapeutic at all... TSH was raised to 22. The only change was the medication... Beware!!!!,Jan
9,Euthyrox,Hypothyroidism After Thyroid Removal,1,Taken for less than 1 month,"November 4, 2021",1,"Hello,I have been switched to Euthyrox and have been taking for 8 days. the pharmacist said it's the same thing but different packaging. Day 4 started to feel lightheaded , nauseated, terrible muscle aches and feeling extremely tired. Very hard to concentrate, so I had to go to the ER , they said nothing wrong levels were fine today. Maybe I was getting a virus. now that I am reading these posts , I am convinced it IS this new medicine. I was on levothyroxine for 10 years and no problem. a few days of this and felling like rubbish!  emailed my doctor to let them know and got a hold of the office and they show that the only one he prescribed was levo. not Euthyrox.I am contacting Walmart and my doctor again to get a my levothyroxine back. If you stop taking Euthyrox how long before side effects go away? ER brushed off without even checking into. I told them about it, but labs were normal today. If I kept taking, I wonder if my labs would have come out worse.",Martinez
10,Euthyrox,Hypothyroidism After Thyroid Removal,1,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"July 20, 2021",5,"I have taken levothyroxine for 38 years with no issues.  Lately I have been having severe anxiety, body aches and my hair was falling out.  All of these things could be from other issues and I didn't connect the dots.  I was refilling my med pack, and a light went off.  The last time I had my prescription refilled, Walmart filled it with Euthyrox.  I went on line and started reading the reviews and side effects.  I have experienced nearly all of them!  I have been testing for food, detergent allergies as I have had lip and mouth swelling, hives, itching.  I called my old pharmacy and am going to pick up my old med.  Do not use this!  I am just hoping that things will get back to normal.",Angry
11,Euthyrox,Hypothyroidism After Thyroid Removal,1,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"June 23, 2021",8,I was writing a email to my doctor because  my eyes were super irritated and dry and when I looked in the mirror it seem like they were bulging again. I realized that I haven't been able to really sleep at night and I recently experienced a minor rash that I wrote off as something else.  I had hyperthyroidism 15 years ago and had my thyroid removed but I'm also a T1 diabetic so I didn't realize that what was going on might have been related to the change in medication.  Recently Walmart also changed me to euthyrox and I just happened to google the medicine while I was writing to my doctor and found these reviews. I'm definitely asking to be switched back. I will also file a complaint with the FDA.,margomichel
12,Euthyrox,Hypothyroidism After Thyroid Removal,1,,"April 10, 2021",4,Thank you everyone for sharing your experiences with this drug. I couldn’t figure out why my hair was falling out and I was dizzy all the time since I filled my prescription in January at Walmart! Switched back to levothyroxine tonight!,Monimon
13,Euthyrox,Hypothyroidism After Thyroid Removal,1,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"March 18, 2021",5,I had the right side of my thyroid removed 3/10/20 and started on Euthyrox about one month later at 75 mcg from Walmart and the side effects stink. Since I have not been on this medicine side effects are terrible.  They have switched me to 50 mcg and have more side effects.  Going to switch to Walgreens to see if anything is better.  Because I can't live with the pain I am in right now.,sally
14,Euthyrox,Hypothyroidism After Thyroid Removal,3,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"January 30, 2021",22,"I just stumbled across this site because I am looking for the cause of extreme hair loss which started a few months ago. My hair started shedding heavily in the summer & just got worse. Comes out in strands. I thought it was just stress, but I started wondering if something I was taking caused it. Then I remembered a few months back WM pharmacy substituted my regular Levothyroxin with Euthrox. Had WM print my meds out for last 2 years. I was given 90 days of Euthrox early Aug. 2020. Now I'm wondering if some other symptoms, like high anxiety, were caused by the change. Will not accept it again.",AN
15,Euthyrox,Hypothyroidism After Thyroid Removal,1,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"November 7, 2020",34,"I am SO GLAD I came on here to look at reviews for this medication, Euthyrox. I have had horrible headaches, dry mouth, brain fog, dizziness, muscle pain, tinnitus, and neck aches. I went to see my ENT because I thought I thought I have something seriously wrong with me. He is scheduling me to have a CAT SCAN done. I'm going to tell my Endocrinologist about my issues with this medication. Getting off this one and see if my issues subside. I was on a different generic med but Wal-Mart switched me to this one. Shame on them!",Scooter
16,Euthyrox,Hypothyroidism After Thyroid Removal,1,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"October 1, 2020",61,"Walmart switched me to this brand back in April.  They assured me it was the exact same thing as the levothyroxine brand I was taking.  I had just had labs done  in March.  Things were good.  By early May my TSH had jumped to a 14 from a .40.  I had fatigue to the point that I was bed bound.  Headaches, sleeplessness, rapid heart rate, sweats, memory issues. This medicine is a dangerous medication.  My dr had several other thyroid patients complain of the same medication after Walmart switched them.  It is absolutely not the same as what I was taking.  This medication will crash your labs and make you feel like the walking dead.  It’s shouldn’t be on the market.",JoyAnaBoo
17,Euthyrox,Hypothyroidism After Thyroid Removal,1,Taken for less than 1 month,"September 27, 2020",32,"My pharmacy switched my prescription to Euthyrox from levothyroxine which I had been taking for 3 years with no problem.  I figured it was maybe due to a supply shortage. The first day I took it, I thought something was terribly wrong with me. I had stomach cramps, heart palpitations, and a bad headache. The second day was worse. When I went to the bathroom, I felt like electricity was going up and down through my body. And another headache. This lasted all day. I decided not to take it the 3rd morning (of course it was the weekend). I called the pharmacy and they replaced it immediately with my previous medication.",Mtn

My pharmacist changed my script to Euthyrox 2 months ago. I noticed the last 2 weeks my head is in a fog, want to sleep more than usual. I’m very disappointed and will talk to my dr about this.",Angel
