0,Letrozole,Breast Cancer Adjuvant,6.0,Taken for 5 to 10 years,"November 2, 2021",1,So much pain and quality of life diminished. In all these years and all this money for cancer research this is the only type of drug given to try and stop return of Breast Cancer. Seems it took 20 yrs after Tamoxifen to be approved. Well it’s just passed now the 20 year mark and Breast Cancer needs something better than letrozole! Don’t get me wrong I take it because I want to live and I’m scared to die and leave my young children. But I am in excruciating pain from it. All this money and awareness!!! Let’s go with a ER+ vaccine and approve it NOW cause people are dying. There’s been zero progress to prevent metastatic breast cancer. Diagnosis early is great but mortality rate is high still.,Vaccine ER+Pray
1,Letrozole,Breast Cancer Adjuvant,10.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"March 21, 2021",2,"I have been on Letrozole for over a year now with minimal side effects.  I do have bone pain and some fatigue.  However, I wanted to share that the only thing I did differently before I was diagnosed with Estrogen/Progesterone driven breast cancer is I started taking Collagen Supplements.  I noticed in the comments that someone is taking this along with the Letrozole and I wanted to share an article from a breast cancer survivor turned Cancer Coach.  I have done exhaustive research myself and I have concluded that Collagen supplementation is a danger to us survivors, especially Type I.  The only Collagen that inhibits tumor growth is Type III, but I am finding it impossible to find a supplement that is only Type III, most are combined with other Types, especially common is Type 1 coupled with Type III.",Butterflylover

3,Letrozole,Breast Cancer Adjuvant,6.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"December 25, 2019",20,I have been on letrazole for 2 1/2 months now. Only major thing I notice is extreme irritability for stupid things. It's BAD. Just stopped to see if it is the med. Anyone else have this happen?,Hellmellyj
4,Letrozole,Breast Cancer Adjuvant,5.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"July 23, 2019",23,"Stage 2 adenocarcinoma of breast found on Mammogram four years ago. Lumpectomy with clean nodes, then 5 weeks radiation therapy. Started on Arimidex with severe hip and joint pain, constant hot flashes, insomnia. After 6 months of this, switched to Tamoxifen with bone pain improved, other symptoms unchanged. After 3.5 years, had pre-cancerous cells with thickening in uterus requiring D&C. Switched to Letrozole three months ago. Insomnia and hot flashes markedly lessened but the back and hip pain is relentless. Chiropractor and ibuprofen help but not sure I can tolerate this one more entire full year (plan is 5 yrs post surgery so one more year this month).",NanDea
5,Letrozole,Breast Cancer Adjuvant,7.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"July 17, 2019",36,"Taking letrozole 3 years and I get it free on NHS in England. Yes, I am lucky. Also lucky that my tumour was identified early at screening. But... it has been very hard coping with joint pains - hips, feet, wrists, hands, back, shoulders - I never know what the day will bring. Trying to keep active. Main worry is osteoporosis. I cannot be active enough to counter the process because of pain in hips and back. Cannot take bisphosphonates because of side effects. Am taking calcium, magnesium, boron, vit D, collagen, glucosamine, chondroitin, fish oils, multi-vit. Resting sprained ankle at present. Best wishes to all.",Cate
6,Letrozole,Breast Cancer Adjuvant,10.0,Taken for 10 years or more,"May 26, 2019",49,"Diagnosed 22 years ago with invasive lobular breast cancer, and 45 out of 48 lymph nodes contained cancer.  (Really.)  But after mastectomy, chemo, radiation, more chemo, 5 years of tamoxifen, a complete hysterectomy, a couple of years of anastrozole and exemestane ... I've been on letrozole for well over 10 years.  I have experienced most of the usual side effects, but I've lived to complain about them.  :-)  No recurrence so far, although I did develop another breast cancer and had a second mastectomy 10 years ago.  Overall, I eat healthy and work out, I do have energy, not much pain anymore, and I still work FT at age 66.  Clearly I've been lucky.  No one expected me to live (least of all me).  But statistics do not determine what will happen to the individual.  Life is good!",Laika

8,Letrozole,Breast Cancer Adjuvant,,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"March 5, 2018",40,"Femara (letrozole):Right mastectomy 2016, 5 months chemo and 5 weeks radio therapy. Started Femara 15 months ago, prescribed for 5 years. I am experiencing increasing pain in my joints, muscles, liver and over all depression. Am considering stopping femara as the tumour was removed with no spread to lymph nodes. Lymph clearance all the same as the centinel node was infected. I am 55 but feel a lot older than ever before!",Bodiceae
9,Letrozole,Breast Cancer Adjuvant,5.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"February 27, 2018",21,"In 2015, I was diagnosed with stage 2A, right breast cancer. I had a mastectomy and reconstruction, as well as a full hysterectomy. This is my second year on Letrozole (scheduled for 5) and my symptoms have just started. Mild headaches, back and neck pain, muscle aches, weight gain, and hair loss. The latest is nausea, which I hate! I have high blood pressure and it has been going up, alarmingly. That's really the main concern that I have since heart disease and strokes run in my family. For the first year, I had no side effects, but now it seems like every one of them are converging at the same time. I'm wondering what I'll experience next, but I've decided to remain on the medication and will try to mitigate the symptoms as best I can. I'm 48 and have had a wonderful life, but I'm living for my family, and especially my new grandchild. So, I'll suffer, but it's worth it to stick around for as long as I can.",cancerfree2018
10,Letrozole,Breast Cancer Adjuvant,10.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"February 17, 2018",18,Had lumpectomy 21 years ago with radiation.  Last year another type of breast cancer came so had breast removed. Started Letrozole 11 mo ago and I was a bit light headed at first.  That has gone away.  My hair thinned on top but took some Biotin vitamins and stopped further breakage.  Now hair is back to normal.  Some various joint stiffness but that goes away.  I had blood clots in both lungs from a knee surgery 4 years ago. Had to be on blood thinners 8 months.  Last week had a blood clot in my left leg yet again.  Went to hospital but didn't make connection for Letrozole to be the cause until I happened to read the information papers in the pill box.  The Dr. never mentioned it. So I have stopped the pill and am waiting for the Dr to get back to me about continuing.,snuggles 2

13,Letrozole,Breast Cancer Adjuvant,10.0,,"May 13, 2016",71,"Femara (letrozole):joint pain, no energy, no enthusiasm for social life, tiredness, weakness, low appetite.Femara is extending my life. I know this since I have been in remission for 5 years after taking Femara. My breast cancer started in right breast 32 years ago. Chemo and Radiation therapy stopped it for 22 years but 5 years ago it matastasized to lung and bones. This is when the oncologist prescribed Femara. I'm now in my ""golden"" years, a widow for 16 years but determined to find relief for this pain and relief from this depression so I can be happy and enjoy life.",marge623
14,Letrozole,Breast Cancer Adjuvant,1.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"May 9, 2016",57,"My 6 months on Letrazole have been a nightmare; extreme hot flushes, soaked clothes /bedclothes. Can't fall asleep even though exhausted. So fuzzy-brained I despair & have lost confidence in normal conversation. Bone pain & frequent lower leg cramps are excruciating. I've aged 10 years, changed shape, gained over 10k, all of it around my waist. I fall; I've sprained both ankles in six weeks. I never know when a fall is coming, there's no warning, I just collapse. In  addition to normal drugs regime, I now need 5 additional drugs to try & counteract side-effects of Letrazole. It may be keeping me alive (who really knows?) but it's destroyed my life in the process. I dread to think what 4.5 more years on this drug will do to me.",Juedne
15,Letrozole,Breast Cancer Adjuvant,1.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"May 29, 2015",47,"Femara (letrozole):Stage IIIc Lobular breast CA, node , Started generic Femara 18 months ago after radiation. Minor side effects- hair loss, nails, skin, vaginal dryness. Major- started out with tolerable joint, bone and muscle pain. But about a month ago, these symptoms became severe enough to decrease my quality of life. My oncologist did blood work, all okay. She wanted a bone scan but after ready reviews, this is the Femara not bone cancer. She just has not had amy Patients do this, the literature is based on trials not general population. The literature( and she told me) the symptoms go away by 8 months! Not!!I also have MS ( still mobile, but that has some same/ similar side affects) but Femara more like arthritis. Knees, ankles.

16,Letrozole,Breast Cancer Adjuvant,5.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"July 27, 2014",60,"I was so pleased to read all of the reviews about Letrozole.  Now I know that I'm not alone.  Hot flashes worse than menopause.  Always off balance.  Won't do stairs without a railing or holding on to person anymore after quite a few falls.  Don't get dizzy, but never know when a stumble or fall is coming.  Very dry mouth (other meds also cause dry mouth/thirst).  This is extremely hard to deal with as chemo put my kidneys in failure and on dialysis am limited to 1.5 liters of liquid a day.  Headaches, bone pain, fatigued constantly, muscle pain especially in legs, lack of appetite, foods don't taste the same. Ran out about a week ago, starting to come out of the fog! Feel like I'm 100, not 57, sigh.",sick of rx's

Managed to continue working through it all. Then took tamoxifen for 2 1/2 years...had horrible muscle cramping and hot flashes, switched to letrozole after determining I was post menopausal. The major muscle cramps lessened considerably, as did the hot flashes. I took this for 2 1/2 years, just stopping 3 weeks ago. I have muscle, joint, bone achiness 24/7, no energy, tired always, feel like I'm in a fog, tinnitus,  heartburn, slow metabolism with weight gain. How long will it take to reverse all of these side effects now that I no longer take it? I even quit taking ibuprofen because it doesn't do anything for the pains.

I started on Aromasin but had terrible joint and muscle pain so my oncologist changed me to Femara.  My joints and muscles feel better but I am so tired that even my oncologist tells me I look worn out.  I will live with the fatigue as I know this medicine works.  I am 58 and I can no longer do what I did less than a year ago.  I ride a bike 40 minutes a day, I eat healthy but I just have no vitality.  I miss my old self.",cauryn
19,Letrozole,Breast Cancer Adjuvant,9.0,,"May 21, 2013",121,"Femara (letrozole):When I switched aromatase inhibitors from Arimidex to Femara it was a world of difference!  The terrible side effects I was experiencing made me question whether survival from breast cancer was worth it if my life would be spent with Arimidex side effects of irritability, MORE hair loss, joint pains, etc. My oncologist switched me to Femara and my life returned to more pleasant and more energy. I have been suggesting this change to all my blogging support group that are having problems with Arimadex. Later adding OTC Biosil and SamE have also helped the hair and joint and mood issues.",mary dresden

The pain has been unbearable, mostly my legs and hands.  Unable to sleep even though I'm exhausted and my hot flashes are really hot fires. I was stage 1 with radiation and unable to take Tamoxifen due to being on antidepressants for some length of time. My oncologist and I will decide what direction to take at the end of March. I am 54 and all over quality rather than quantity. I have 3 grandchildren that I want to play with TODAY!",Penny T
22,Letrozole,Breast Cancer Adjuvant,10.0,,"November 18, 2011",121,"Femara (letrozole):After reading of so many negative side effects of Femara I was hesitant to start. Since it decreases my chances of recurrence by 25% I felt I must try it. I've been on it for 1 year now and have had very few if any negative side effects. My hair regrowth has been spotty and slow, whether due to the Femara or just the general effects of chemo and radiation I'm not sure. I switched 2 months ago to the generic formula, have noticed no changes. I feel very fortunate not to have suffered many of the effects other women have reported.",Anonymous
