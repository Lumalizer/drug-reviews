0,Leuprolide,Breast Cancer Adjuvant,2,,"August 2, 2011",35,"Lupron (leuprolide):After surgery and radiation therapy, I was unable to take Tamoxifen, so I got a 1-month shot of Lupron to prevent a recurrence of breast cancer. I had no symptoms, so I got the 3-month shot and immediately had problems. I expected the bad hot flashes and dryness, but wasn't prepared for the severe bone pain and muscle pain.  I'm used to dealing with pain, but this was extreme.  By the end of the 3-mos, the bone pain was gone, but the muscle pain and injection site soreness was still there. I got another 1-mo shot and have been doing better.  Now I have unexplained swelling/soreness in my left hand.  ",Anonymous
