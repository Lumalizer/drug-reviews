0,Tamoxifen,Breast Cancer Adjuvant,1,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"July 7, 2021",2,"At age 58 I was diagnosed with stage 1 IDC in Oct 2017.  Had mastectomy in Dev 2017.  Refused to start Aromatase inhibitors for first year post op due to side effects. Tried AI for a month after Oncologist convinced me and I  had  side effects of terrible muscle pains and cramps, hot flashes that were severe,  and severe constipation.  Was also put on Effexor to help against side effects. I stopped both of these and asked to be put on Tamoxifen, but at a lower level with my argument being that the San Antonio University study in 2013 documented that 5mg was enough to keep cancer from reoccurring and the 20 mg caused greater side effects.  Also, an Italian study states the same.  MyOncologist doesn’t like it, but I take the 5mg dose daily, at night.  Still have insomnia, hot flashes, muscle pains and cramps. Also my BUN level is high. Is this drug worth being on with these side effects???  I’ve weaned myself to 2.5 g per day and symptoms are a bit less.",RN
1,Tamoxifen,Breast Cancer Adjuvant,2,Taken for less than 1 month,"January 9, 2020",20,"I just started taking Tamoxifen about a week ago.  I am always nauseous, I am noticing my hair thinning since I started, my jaw hurts and the pelvic pains are so uncomfortable.  I am always crying and saying things I would never say.  I will need to speak to my doctor and see if there are other alternatives.  Hopefully there is.",Nanoo
2,Tamoxifen,Breast Cancer Adjuvant,5,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"August 14, 2019",36,"I've been on Tamoxifen for about a year as hormonal blockade for stage 1 invasive ductal carcinoma (small, but grade 3). At first, I just had insomnia, which is being treated with Ambien and Remeron. Now, I'm getting crushing fatigue, TMJ, and hip bursitis after I walk (about 2-3 miles on most days). I've also had a posterior vitreous detachment, first on left eye, then on right. The line I'm getting from oncology is: Those are symptoms of ageing; everyone has those, and it is not Tamoxifen that is causing it. Well, I went on a trip and stopped it for 3 weeks. Walking about 4 miles daily, on the go, and I didn't have the pain. Started Tamoxifen again, and it all came back within a month. Very frustrating, but I'm afraid not to take it.",ESeard
3,Tamoxifen,Breast Cancer Adjuvant,9,Taken for 5 to 10 years,"February 6, 2017",42,"I had stage 2 grade A IDC with trace evidence in sentinel node, I've been on tamoxifen for 5 years with 5 years left to go.  I currently have the following side effects; hot flashes, night sweats, insomnia, fatigue, blurred vision, hair loss, hair thinning, hypertriglyceridemia, bone and joint pain, and can not tolerate drug brand changes, and have had to have a total hysterectomy.",Mstrouble
4,Tamoxifen,Breast Cancer Adjuvant,8,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"February 15, 2015",58,"I am 41 years old and like many who have already posted, wished the doctors would just be more up front regarding the side effects.  I think it would be more manageable, as sometimes I think I am crazy.  I have had peeling of my hands, foot swelling,  foot pain, decreased sex drive, fatigue, and yeast infections.  I have taken Tamoxifen for 2 years and am on the 10 year study.  My children are my motivation for taking this medicine.",Still cancer free
5,Tamoxifen,Breast Cancer Adjuvant,10,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"May 3, 2014",49,"Hot flushes not to bad, suffer from fatigue and bone pain, but the medicine makes me feel safe.",Kcyorkie
