0,Herceptin,Breast Cancer Adjuvant,9.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"July 21, 2016",16,"Had Herceptin along with Perjeta, Carboplatin & Taxotere for 6 months. HER+ hormone negative stage 3a cancer was believed to have completely resolved from biopsy results after 6 months chemo was over & double mastectomy and 6 lymph glands removed. Currently continuing Herceptin infusions without chemo every 3 weeks & undergoing 6 weeks of radiation to prevent recurrence. Hard to tell what symptoms were from which drug during chemo and now with radiation , but now I have dizziness, occasional shortness of breath and fatigue. Have also experienced nausea, but not with every treatment. I believe this drug saved my life for now & I am grateful. Doctors say my prognosis would've been much worse without this drug.",Anonymous
1,Herceptin,Breast Cancer Adjuvant,,,"July 15, 2016",10,I have no idea if this drug is working? The side effects are not pleasant. After the infusion and a few days following heart racing and pounding so hard you can hear it!  All kinds of rashes have developed in throughout body.  Urine has a distinct odor and one has to urinate continually.  Many don't know that this originated from rodents and the thought of that is enough to make anyone ill.  The anti-body was developed from mice!   I have no idea if it's working.  Just now having the infusions is not pleasant. They call it a miracle drug in the man and his team who worked so long and hard on it or very dedicated.  So for those with triple positive breast cancer it is said to be a lifesaver.  Hoping for the best outcome.,+++
