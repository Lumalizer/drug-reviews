1,Nasonex,Sinus Symptoms,10.0,Taken for 10 years or more,"August 22, 2021",0,"I have been using Nasonex for years with no problems or side effects, I suffer from bad allergies and sinus infections and with the help of Sudafed  or sinutab and Nasonex along with some Allegra, I am good to go. Whenever I feel any discomfort during allergy season, these products help and I don't see any side effects.",Captain America
2,Nasonex,Sinus Symptoms,2.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"July 28, 2021",1,Got prescribed nasonex for sinusitis. I was supposed to be on it for a month but I could only handle the side effect symptoms for a week. I wanted to alleviate my sinus symptoms because of the sinus headaches I was getting but nasonex just gave me even more intense headaches that made my cheeks and forehead go numb. My nasal cavities are a little clearer but I can't even function with these headaches. So not worth the trade off.,Haley M.
3,Nasonex,Sinus Symptoms,1.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"April 9, 2021",18,"I began using this after suffering from nasal congestion, headaches and sinus pains.  After I began taking it I suffered from terrible pain behind my eyes, nausea and anxiety.  I went to so many doctors but nobody was able to pinpoint what it was.  I was having around 20 migraine/headache days per month.  Painkillers were not helping and I was constantly put on higher and higher doses, which all eventually stopped helping.  My nasal congestion also didn't really clear up but for some reason I still persisted.  I didn't think it was the spray as I used other steroid sprays in the past so didn't dream it was the Nasonex.  At one point it dawned on me that it might just be the Nasonex.  I stopped using it and have not had another headache since.  I feel better in myself and not so anxious anymore. I suffered terribly for 4 months.",Judy

6,Nasonex,Sinus Symptoms,5.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"August 11, 2020",2,"The Nasonex spray dispenser says 65 sprays. I've been spraying only twice in each nostril per day, and have had it for 2 weeks and it ran out, so only 56 sprays.I have no issue with the medicine, because it works, it's just the short changing of 9-10 sprays to save money their end but at a cost to the customer.",TJ

9,Nasonex,Sinus Symptoms,5.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"August 5, 2019",47,"The Nasonex caused crazy anxiety, super dizzy and weird visual things like after images from lights that would last 5 minutes. Waking up in middle of night totally dizzy and spinning. It might work well I'm not sure because I had to stop using it. The visual stuff freaked me out too much.",Hgftydfffdd

11,Nasonex,Sinus Symptoms,5.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"May 23, 2019",25,"Nasonex was recommended by my ENT to assist with symptoms of  eustachian tube dysfunction (ETD) which I’ve endured for a couple of months now. I used Nasonex for 4 weeks and found it did nothing apart from make me feel nauseous and made my nasal passages extremely dry with slight blood in mucus, I also had a sore throat. I took myself off it and use saline nasal sprays instead, I find they do more for me and keep my nasal passages moist.",Mandy
12,Nasonex,Sinus Symptoms,5.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"April 15, 2019",5,"The product works well. The problem is the packaging. Why don't manufacturers stop using so much unnecessary packaging for their products when disposal is such a growing problem. Nasonex Allergy comes in a lovely plastic container that does not require a huge cardboard box, more than twice the size of the container. There is now a large space just for directions. Its about time these manufacturers started getting a little innovative with their packaging and reduced the need for unwanted excessive packaging that continues to produce problems for landfill.",Aquakiwi
13,Nasonex,Sinus Symptoms,5.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"July 19, 2018",9,"I use nasonex for sinus/nasal swelling that causes headaches or fluid build up in my ears. It had always been more effective than antihistamines or anti inflammatory meds. I have issues with dry mouth and I think nasonex aggravates it, but I had to quit nasonex completely once I got dental implants. I got 4 dental implants, and nasonex causes the gum tissue around them to become so sensitive that I get queasy when my check touches rubs against my gums. It takes a long time to get better and my allergist and dentist are perplexed. There is no redness, or sores, in fact the gums look 100% normal, but the sensitivity is extremely uncomfortable and can last for weeks. It is awful that I have to choose which issue I have to live with. One doctor did say they saw a very very faint white lace pattern on the gums where it hurt, but everyone else said they saw no sign of something being physically wrong.",MadHater
14,Nasonex,Sinus Symptoms,1.0,,"November 12, 2017",10,"My son experienced adverse reaction the morning after 1st dose (1 spray per nostril ) he complained of headache I thought was just because of his colds, he coughed more frequently and late in the afternoon he has low grade fever then he complained his legs ache, I relate all these with different things like another cold, too much playing , then I read the drug info thats when I had a hunch, so after second spray I observed his reaction on the first 2 hours , then the coughing happened again .I will stop the spray now and find a way to talk to the doctor tomorrow. I gave him Benadryl syrup and nebulize him with salbutamol . His usual treatment during attacks...",DeanM
15,Nasonex,Sinus Symptoms,2.0,,"October 10, 2017",10,"I've been using nasonex for a good 3 weeks. Now and it really doesn't seem to work at all. If anything it seems to make my nose even more runny and now I can even taste it... use with caution, it could make your problem worst.",MaelstromDragons
16,Nasonex,Sinus Symptoms,10.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"November 9, 2016",22,This medication has helped me with my sinus headaches that I get often (not just with seasonal allergies). It helps with opening up my swollen nasal passages when my allergies are act up.,Paula Darlene
17,Nasonex,Sinus Symptoms,,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"November 6, 2016",21,"I was prescribed this nasal spray as a form of treatment for symptoms of sinus. Before I started using Nasonex I was having at least three sinus infections a year which required antibiotics to clear up the pain, build of mucus etc. I take one spray in each nostril every night. And thankfully I haven't had an antibiotic for a sinus infection in a few years.",Anonymous
18,Nasonex,Sinus Symptoms,2.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"November 1, 2016",5,"First of all, it didn't really help me, I still suffered as much after I used it a few times for a sinusitis that was about to start. Second, it caused a huge cold sore to burst on my lip. I only had a cold sore once before (the first time I was infected) so I don't have have much doubt that Nasonex is what caused it.",Samielle
