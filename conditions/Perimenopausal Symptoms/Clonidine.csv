1,Clonidine,Perimenopausal Symptoms,10.0,Taken for 5 to 10 years,"January 22, 2022",0,"I have been taking clonidine for 10 years now.  I am 63 this year, yes I started hit flushes when I was 32 which seem to be a family thing. I used to take two at night for number of years, then just one past 3 years then went down to just half of the 25mgs and I have  been doing this for around 6 weeks now. Hot flushes are hitting me bad now, needed to come off them because only got around 3-4hours sleep a night due nightmares all the time.  I feel so strange trying to come off due to the dizziness and strange feeling that keeps passing through my body which is horrible and causing  a lot of anxiety now.  I feel so strange in my self.",Liz
2,Clonidine,Perimenopausal Symptoms,,Taken for less than 1 month,"November 11, 2021",0,"After the first dose Clonidine worked for me.  I had to up the dose a little, but then no more hot flushes.  I also have to mention that I was on Lyrica 300 mg twice a day and started titrating down.  When I was finally off the Lyrica is when the hot flashes started.  I was on Lyrica for something else and I didn't know I was having hot flashes as Lyrica is one of the meds that they give you for hot flushes.  I went back on the Lyrica and had to go right back up to my regular dose and I was still having hot flushes.  Then I started Clonidine.  Wow.  Took everything away.  I can drink or eat hot or spicy foods without fear of a HF.  I can even soak in a hot bath again.  My hope is that I might be able to titrate down the Lyrica again as far as I can go if the Clonidine will work as well without the Lyrica.",Misty

4,Clonidine,Perimenopausal Symptoms,8.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"April 6, 2021",16,Taken out of work for what Dr called fatigue but spent a lot of time feeling down and crying. Ended up going through surgery for female issues which bought on very bothersome menopausal symptoms and worsening what appeared to be turning into depression and anxiety. Dr had given me clonidine to treat hot flashes but I began to notice that I didn’t feel as anxious or moody anymore. I even was able to get good sleep at night. My thoughts no longer seem to run away with me!,Terry

6,Clonidine,Perimenopausal Symptoms,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"February 9, 2021",8,I started with perimenopausal  symptoms late last year but didn't realize that I was going into menopause.   Only last month did I realize that it was menopause and it become worse.  The sweating was unbareable coupled with severe headaches.   My pharmacist suggested I use menograin (a brand of clonidine) and my sweating has subsided tremendously.   Great product,Vani
7,Clonidine,Perimenopausal Symptoms,10.0,,"November 19, 2020",14,"I was put into medical menopause due to cancer. The night sweats were absolutely horrible, and I was having issues falling asleep. And if I did, it was only for 3 hours broken up, throughout the night. I went to see my regular dr multiple times and was put on several prescriptions for the hot and night flashes - nothing worked. I then called my GYN dr and he prescribed me Clonidine HCL 0.1mg Tabs. I was to take 1 tablet at night daily for the first 2 weeks, then increase to 2 tabs.  I have been taking 1 tab at night for 3 weeks now, and have been sleeping without night sweats. I was only on them for 1 week before I noticed a change. HOWEVER, I did not increase my dose to 2 tabs because 1 tab is working well for me. If this stops happening, then I will increase to 2 tabs, but for now, 1 is doing the trick, and I am so happy and back to my normal self.  I have not noticed any side-affects at all.",Amber

10,Clonidine,Perimenopausal Symptoms,5.0,,"June 13, 2020",2,I have been on clonidine 25mcg for a couple of years for hot flushes after some time it didn't seem to be working so I stopped them. 1 week later I noticed my bp had shot up and I started getting bad anxiety which really frightened me (a side effect of stopping abruptly) however my GP recommended I start again increasing the dose every 2-3 days which I did. I started taking 25mcg once a day then 25mcg twice a day then 50mcg at night and 25mcg in the morning however the anxiety came back dr advised I cut back down until anxiety subsides. I now take 25mcg twice a day but still a little anxious I'm hoping my system will settled and my anxiety goes. It has been a real struggle yet before I stopped taking them not a sign of anxiety at all,Upset lady

The flashes stopped within a day or so, I couldn’t believe it. It was bliss for about 5 weeks and then I had my period (after 107 days) and it all changed. The flashes gradually came back worse than before. I will see my doctor about increasing the dose or changing  the times I take it and hopefully it works again. Good luck everyone!

I'm due back to doctors next week so will be asking him to gradually take me off these. The side effects which I have been getting and never had before taking these is constant dry eyes causing eye infection and crustiness round my eyes, swelling of the lower part of my legs and feet, my skin has become very dry and flaky, persistent morning headaches, and just recently noticed my hair seems to be thinning out. I checked side effects out online and all these were listed, it also said not to just stop taking the tablets as this could increase your blood pressure. I take 2 tablets in morning and 2 at night of 25 micrograms for each tablet.I'm so sad that it has caused me side effects as the tablet was working well, apart from the unwanted side effects.",Jue
13,Clonidine,Perimenopausal Symptoms,6.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"October 11, 2019",63,"I tried clonidine, it worked great for hot flashes at first. Then it stopped or I got worse. Not sure. I also increased my dosage too quickly, got dizzy, fell down so be careful!  I made a mistake by taking all the pills at once and they haven’t helped. I’ll try to spread them out over the day. One VERY IMPORTANT THING!!! people are writing on here that they are taking 25mg pills. That is WRONG!! I think they mean 25 micrograms or 25 MCG  or 25 mcg and NOT 25 mg as they are writing. The pills come in 0.1 mg. The highest dose you can take of them is 6 pills. That is only 0.6mg NOT 6 mg or, God forbid, 25 mg!! I’m not a doctor so of course please double check me with your doctor to be sure. But I was very confused and called my pharmacy to figure it out. Hopefully I am translating what they told me accurately. Good Luck!!!",Me

Hot flushes were a nightmare, my mood swings so bad, everyone kept telling me to calm down. Dr put me on these and after few days flushes stopped and mood back to normal, I stopped taking them few weeks ago. Thinking I'm over hot flushes, big mistake, within a day or two they came back with vengeance, Started taking them again, I only take two 25mcg at night and bingo all stopped again.

I tend to have low blood pressure and low heart rate so my GP wanted to be conservative. For me it has revolutionised my life. I have suffered flushes for over 10 years and due to having had hormone positive breast cancer could not take any HRT. I have occassional flushes but nothing like I used to, and my anxiety associated with the flushing has also reduced. This was immediate. So grateful to have found this drug.",Kiera

Started at 25mcg twice daily, with a light reduction in night sweats - then went back to my GP (I'm from the UK) and he issued more and I'm now prescribes two 25mcg twice a day.  However, as mine are mainly night sweats - I've adjusted that to one 25mcg in the morning and two 25mcg at night.  This dose is working great for me and I am now free of night sweats and getting better sleep for longer.  I would recommend this to all that are going through this horrendous time - only wish I had known about other non hormonal options as I've had to suffer for over 10 years.",pernicketywitch

I didn't think that Catapres would work. But it did!!! I don't get night/day sweats any more. I get the occasional hot flush if I eat too many fatty foods. It does take a LONG time to be effective, though, about 6 weeks. I went back to my Dr to increase the dose to 1 1/2 tablets a day, which eliminated my symptoms.

I was told no more BHRT. Even though I tapered down, I soon began having night sweats and hot flashes again. At 64, this was just unacceptable! I heard about Clonidine. I don't like taking medications if I don't have to, but I was desperate to find relief. I have been using only 0.1 MG once a day instead of twice a day as directed, mainly because I simply can't remember to take it twice. So far, I think it's doing what it's intended.

At first I took half a tablet (morning and night) with no result. After a week of that I switched to a full tablet (morning and night). At first still no improvement but then after a couple weeks I noticed a slight improvement. Gradually things got better and better til after 6 wks I can honestly say they are 100% gone.
