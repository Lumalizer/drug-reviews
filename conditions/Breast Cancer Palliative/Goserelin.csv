0,Goserelin,Breast Cancer Palliative,,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"October 10, 2019",1,Zoladex (goserelin):21 years ago I was given Zoladex as breast cancer treatment.  I stopped treatment after 18 months as the hot flushes were severe.  Now two decades later they are still horrendous.  Has anyone else had this experience?,sam 66
1,Goserelin,Breast Cancer Palliative,,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"October 1, 2019",6,"Zoladex (goserelin):The side effects from this drug have not been as bad as I expected them to be. Hot flushes are the worst of it, particularly at night time. I have gained a small amount of weight, but I am trying to eat healthily and exercise regularly to try and combat this.",Survivor
2,Goserelin,Breast Cancer Palliative,7.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"February 26, 2016",12,"Zoladex (goserelin):I'm now 33 and have been taking zolodex for 2 years alongside Tamoxifen for 10 years in the UK. This medication gave me the confidence not to have chemotherapy and for this I am grateful. The down sides are pretty bad though. I agree with the previous reviewer. Mood swings, increased body temperature, severe hot flushes and night sweats (trying acupuncture to help), increased sex drive, no periods, significant weight gain! I went from 7.5 stone to 9.5 stone in 18months having never had much fluctuation in my weight ever before. My bra size also increased 3 cup sizes. I have gone from being very healthy and slim to quite flabby and ""technically"" (BMI) overweight - which hits hard when you feel low self esteem because of surgery anyway.",Spratster
3,Goserelin,Breast Cancer Palliative,6.0,,"March 1, 2010",53,"Zoladex (goserelin):I am 32 years old and I have to take Zoladex for 3 years with the medicine Tamoxifen for 5 years. I have been on Zoladex for about a year now. Some of my side effects include severe mood swings, hot flashes, loss of menstrual cycle, weight gain (28 pounds so far), loss of energy, swelling of hands, forgetfulness.",kiki 32
