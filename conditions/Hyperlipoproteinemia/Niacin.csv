0,Niacin,Hyperlipoproteinemia,9,,"March 10, 2015",7,Niaspan (niacin):I must be really rare because my condition is low cholesterol.  My body does not produce enough niacin.  My bad cholesterol is at a normal range so are my lipids.  I have been on Niaspan for 6 years at least.  My cholesterol levels have been steady since.  I am at the maximum dose of 2000mg a day. The only problem with it is the flushing.  I hate it!  I take it at night with a bowl of cereal and a 325 mg entrophen to reduce the flushing.,Nicky08
