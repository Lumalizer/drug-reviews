0,Gemfibrozil,Hyperlipoproteinemia,1,Taken for less than 1 month,"August 13, 2020",4,"I have a high lipid level and my doctor prescribed me this drug gemfibrozil. First day of use it gave me severe heartburn that I  have to reach my PPI again to neutralize my stomach acid, it was very painful. And now in 4 days of use my heart, stomach and chest started to ache like crazy and I'm having trouble breathing like something was blocking my throat. Moreover every time I ate a meal my stomach started to belch and it felt like my insides was gonna burst out at any moment. This drug is making me worse rather than it is curing me, stay away from this stupid drug.",Virz
