0,Simvastatin,Hyperlipoproteinemia,8,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"March 19, 2014",28,"Simvastatin 40mg, one tablet taken at bedtime. I weighed about 240 lbs. This medicine is effective at lowering lipids and triglycerides when taken regularly. Clinical trials prove these medicines lower stroke & heart attack risk.Also take soluble fiber immediately after meals when possible to supplement cholesterol reduction and Vitamin B6 to lower homocysteine levels.  Skip a dose if you are going to have alcohol beverages that evening or day, so it doesn't over-tax your liver.  Same with acetaminophen.Most noticeable side effect is mild insomnia and some mild muscle stiffness, both managed with daily Yoga and regular exercise.  Hoping to get lowering dose to 20mg in a month or so, assuming blood tests show positive results.",bigcitydog
