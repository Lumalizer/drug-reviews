0,Valacyclovir,Herpes Simplex,6,Taken for 5 to 10 years,"February 18, 2022",0,"Devastated! At first, outbreaks occurred  months apart. I took the pill daily for a few months and my hair started breaking in one spot. Now I only take valtrex when I have an outbreak. Still trying to find out why the color of the pill changed from blue to white (m122). The blue pills worked better. I’m going to have to research what the ingredients are in the pills. Now I’m having more outbreaks with the white pills. If I didn’t take the pills at the first sign of outbreaks I. would have a hard time healing naturally. This drug has definitely got to be making a lot of profits for big pharma. I don’t think they’re interested in a cure.  Like many others, I’m hoping for a cure. Sucks having to live like this. You get use to it but still sucks. Side effects aren’t severe. I get a thick white discharge . Not sure if I feel tired more after the pill.",Candy
1,Valacyclovir,Herpes Simplex,2,Taken for less than 1 month,"January 11, 2022",0,It only stops the urine burning 2 hours after I take it. Other than that it burns when I sit in cool or warm water to urinate. I can't go to work it hurts to walk and I don't see an end in sight. More sores have formed but I will say a few went away I don't feel the pain of the urine hitting them anymore it's like pain stayed on one side. I'm on day 3 and I still feel like rubbish.,Anonymous
2,Valacyclovir,Herpes Simplex,10,Taken for less than 1 month,"November 11, 2021",0,"O. My... Before this medication when I would get an outbreak from genital herpes it was the worst; very painful and it made me feel helpless. BUT my doctor prescribed me this medicine and it truly is the best. I felt an outbreak coming on, tingling and itching and pain. I took this and by the second day I felt it was getting better, by the third day I felt like the outbreak never began. This medicine will be something I take forever if I have to. I wish I found this sooner. Such a lifesaver",Miss T
3,Valacyclovir,Herpes Simplex,10,Taken for 10 years or more,"July 19, 2021",1,"My initial outbreak was approximately 30 years ago, began Acyclovir immediately.  During the  30 year time span, experienced 2-3 minor outbreaks. Was eventually prescribed Valacyclovir perhaps due to cost effectiveness, nevertheless; I prefer Acyclovir. I thank God for having a mild case of such a painful disease and have been monogamous for several years.",big
4,Valacyclovir,Herpes Simplex,6,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"December 24, 2020",4,"I have been on prophylactic valacyclovir for genital hsv for 2 years without any flares! Before I was getting them every three-four months. I was getting blue pills and it was great but this batch is white and I’ve had 2 flares in the last two weeks. This batch is generic from camber pharmaceutical. Beware, I don’t think it’s effective.",Word of caution

Been on this stuff for about 6 months and nothing.Doctor said to increase dosage, still nothing, said to add Abreva topically to it, still nothing.

7,Valacyclovir,Herpes Simplex,10,Taken for less than 1 month,"September 15, 2019",15,I don't see many reviews for my condition (Genital herpes HSV-1 ) so wanted to share. First breakout was 11 months ago and lasted week and 1/2. Broke out Sunday with sores. Monday got a second crop. Took the valacyclovir 11 am Tuesday. Wednesday it was like the medicine sped up the cycle of the sore instead of making it go away. They were fully formed. Thursday woke up and they were healing. Friday almost gone. Sunday they were completely healed. I feel like if I hadn't taken the meds it definitely would have taken longer to heal. I took 500 my twice a day for 3 days. Only side effect was nausea when taken without food but worth it.,Lin
