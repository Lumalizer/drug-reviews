0,Acyclovir,Herpes Simplex,10.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"February 2, 2022",1,"Diagnosed with HSV2 11 years ago. Never received information of tablets I could take. Searched for a natural remedy. An active gym enthusiast and going through the stresses in life, I had outbreaks nearly every other months that lasted weeks. Tea tree oil stung like anything, L-Lysine sometimes worked, but I'd have to take 6000mg+ everyday which made me tired. Hot baths did nothing either.Smoking and drinking definitely assisted in causing outbreaks. I cut these two out as it had health benefits being in my mid-30's. Exercise of any sort resulted in outbreaks. Manscaping would cause outbreaks too. Depression was getting worse, I had no sex life and I needed to be me. Not a fan of prescribed medicine and avoided the dr's being 'manly' but I thought what the heck after seeing reviews on this site and it's saved my life. 10+ years of depression gone in an instance! 400mg once or twice per day. A lot of people have HSV2 and it could be worse. Stay positive! Time to catch up for lost time ;)",GetYourLifeBack

2,Acyclovir,Herpes Simplex,8.0,Taken for 5 to 10 years,"October 19, 2021",1,"I have had this for 10 years or longer  and I wanted to let people know about Acyclovir and Valacyclovir and my experience with them both.  I only read one review that mentioned this and it's on the Valacyclovir side of reviews from 2019.  So I was first given acyclovir 200 mg 2 pills 3 times a day which I really never needed to take that many to clear up my symptoms . I didn't want to take that many if I didn't need them and become used to them, cause we all know how an outbreak can be.  Fast forward to 6-2021 I went to my dr for a check-up on all meds and we discussed trying Valcyvlovir 500mg I thought why not its newer and supposed to last longer not having to take as many pills, I was all for it.  Well if its not broke dont fix it, cause I had a flare up it didn't go away not near as good as with a dose of Acyclovir capsules.  So I called and told the dr I wanted the Acyclovir back the other didn't work for me. So Beware newer or stronger is not always better.",slduke45

6,Acyclovir,Herpes Simplex,9.0,,"October 31, 2020",1,I think it worked okay within 3 days my breakout was gone. But I don't like that you have to take it 3 times daily for a week straight then keep taking it for prevention if you get breakouts because I forget half the time. It makes me really sick if I don't eat and I have celiac disease so if you can't eat much like I can't this isn't the right kind for you. Because it's not the right one for me and the pill itself is huge looks like a dungeon and dragon symbol,Grey

Both have been effective in eliminating or reducing outbreaks. Especially if applied at very first signs of oncoming event.

I was prescribed acyclovir and I had a severe allergic reaction. It turns out it was Dyshidrosis (pompholyx) blisters on your hands from stress.

I was throwing up, lost weight and my skin/face began to show signs of jaundice. I thought I maybe fatal at one point, my skin began to thin to the point I was seeing the coloration of muscle underneath. I still have scars from it. I had these terrible hives for three months until I was given a steroid shot and montelukast. It was a terrible allergic reaction and this medication is known to cause Steven Johnsons Syndrome (SJS), google it because it is terrifying.

I went to the ER and the doctor diagnosed me genital herpes. Luckily it's a small localized area she said, and gave me Acyclovir  400 MG to take 3x a day. I'm on the 3rd day and it's a huge difference. The site is healing, it's not burning when I urinate, no more fever, and a lot less discharge.

As soon as you feel any tingling at all. If you are unfortunate enough to have reached the weeping sores phase I found the only thing to soothe the pain was salt water with black tea.

A never ending cycle of breakout, heal, breakout. After one day of using the cream and Acyclovir the large bump on the side of my lip flattened to the point of not noticing it. Day six and I haven't seen my face look this clear in years. One little teeny whitehead popped up last night below my lip but you can't tell its a herpes sore.

Very very painful, it was hard to walk, sit sleep, go to the bathroom.  I searched the web for treatment.  First I tried tea tree oil, that was too harsh down there. Then I took 6,000 mg of Lysine, that did not help at all.  Took 3,000 mg vitamin C, nothing.  I felt that white vinegar helped a bit and cornstarch was soothing.  I took 2 Epsom salt baths a day and that was soothing also.  The only thing that helped was Acyclovir all symptoms went away right away.",anonmmmm
