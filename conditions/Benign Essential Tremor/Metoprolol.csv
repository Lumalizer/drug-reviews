0,Metoprolol,Benign Essential Tremor,9,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"February 19, 2017",11,"I use this both for high blood pressure and for tremors caused by my mood stabilizers. If I miss my dose by even a few hours I notice the tremors become quite quickly worse than while on metoprolol. Works well, but not perfectly. Definitely would be completely miserable and quite debilitated without it.",Justj3n1ca
1,Metoprolol,Benign Essential Tremor,8,,"September 29, 2013",40,This medication has prevented tremors and improved my quality of life.  It also helps with anxiety and headaches.  It is a much milder alternative to Xanax for light anxiety sufferers. ,Shaky52
2,Metoprolol,Benign Essential Tremor,5,,"November 6, 2011",54,Metoprolol Succinate ER (metoprolol):It minimally reduced the tremors. The most startling side effect was the sudden drop in blood pressure after taking the medication for approximately 1 month to a level of 78/36 for no apparent reason.,Anonymous
3,Metoprolol,Benign Essential Tremor,9,,"September 24, 2008",57,"This medication has helped my tremors immensely. Before, I was afraid to walk down a flight of stairs.  Another bonus has been the frequency and severity of my migraines. It does make me drowsy and if I skip a dose or two, my migraines and shakes will increase dramatically. With this medicine my quality of life has improved so much.",Anonymous
