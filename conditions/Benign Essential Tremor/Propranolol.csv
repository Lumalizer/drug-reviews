I've struggled with social anxiety/phobia for 15 years. I've always had a tremor however, anxiety would make my tremor so bad that my whole body would convulse. You could hear the tremor in my voice when I talked and my head would twitch. It stopped me from speaking to and eating around people. Since taking propranolol the bad twitching has almost completely stopped. I still get anxiety and the occasional panic attack but my physical symptoms are much more controlled. I also noticed I rarely get migraines anymore - used to get them every couple of months. This medicine has changed my life.",Twitchy

Started propranolol a week ago and within a day or so the tremors were all but gone, and I've noticed no side effects at all. I could barely write my name before, now I'm rock steady.  No more embarrassing tremors!",Dave61
55,Propranolol,Benign Essential Tremor,10.0,,"July 1, 2011",88,My tremors in my right hand were getting so bad I could hardly write my name. Stress would make the tremors even worse. Within 1 day of starting 80mg Propranolol the tremors had disappeared. It has been a huge benefit to my quality of life. I have been taking it daily for 6 months now and the tremors are now very minor in the worst case such as extreme stress.,Anonymous
56,Propranolol,Benign Essential Tremor,10.0,,"June 22, 2011",61,"Inderal (propranolol):Propranolol has given me the best tremor control with the least amount of side effects. I tried 4 other medications before my new neurologist suggested this. It's changed my life. No need to increase after 6 months. Some orthostatic hypotension has been an problem, but it seems to be due to mixing this with other medications required for my other health issues.",AnnaMKyle

In an effort to make a career change, I asked my doctor to find a non-narcotic solution.  In short, after seeing a neurologist I was prescribed propranolol and I'm free of almost all symptoms with less side effects and the negative stigma of being prescribed a benzo.",Anonymous

My shaking was completely uncontrollable prior to the medicine and I can definitely tell within a half a day if I forget to take it.  Lately I am noticing dizzy and light headedness, I normally have low Blood Pressure and am wondering if it has dropped too low now.",Anonymous

When I went in for my annual visit and said everything was as usual, no better but no worse, she changed me to primidone.  I am on my 3rd month of this and feel like a basketcase.  Vertigo, stomach problems, vision problems, memory problems.  ",shakey head
