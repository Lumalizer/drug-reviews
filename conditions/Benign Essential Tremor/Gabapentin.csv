0,Gabapentin,Benign Essential Tremor,4,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"October 30, 2020",8,"I started taking Gabapentin because of nerve pain in my legs.  300mg 3x per day fixed that.  Unfortunately, I started noticing really bad tremors in my hands, although I have been told that they have been trembling for years by my kids.  So my Rheumatologist sent me to a Neurologist, who increased my dosage twice.  Now at 1200mg per day and having shortness of breath that makes me panic and the tremors are not better.  Got to call him in the morning.",Sherrie
1,Gabapentin,Benign Essential Tremor,10,,"March 8, 2020",13,I found this medication gabapentin to calm my tremors but not eliminate them But better than others I've tried Easy to take Have very little side effect Can maintain my independence some what better due to less tremors,Lynnlynn
2,Gabapentin,Benign Essential Tremor,9,Taken for 10 years or more,"August 2, 2019",11,"So, Neurontin, (Gabapentin), I have used this med off & on for 20 yrs. To treat multiple issues, 1st, as a mood stabilizer, I benefited @ a pretty high dosage (600mg X 3). Recall no adverse effects, eventually we just changed a few meds to better address my current symptoms. Then, years later, I used for chronic pain @ a low dose, not really helpful for that. Finally, my tremors have gotten worse, at times very troubling & embarrassing. So, in addition to Propanol, PRN, I'm going to add gabapentin, hopeful of a stabilizing effect. As symptoms changed, Gabapentin has often been provided, without any adverse effects. With only Propanol, 3X a day, I suffered ED, so discontinued ASAP, now, hoping to be lucky as PRN, and Gabapentin regularly. Time will tell.",tklim1
3,Gabapentin,Benign Essential Tremor,8,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"April 13, 2018",57,"I have had tremors since 1992 and its the most annoying, embarrassing and depressing thing.ever.  tried propranolol which works at high doses but as a runner could not deal with feeling sluggish.  Tried other meds that made me so sleepy!  So then I was prescribed this and didn't expect much, but it helped!   I don't like having to take it 3 times A-day because I always forget but it is so worth the time  And effort . I hope it works for a long time to come because  I am finally getting a  bit of relief.  I too cannot hold a cup or plate without assistance. I'm only 50 years old and I feel like I'm 90. It sucks.",Lucktron
4,Gabapentin,Benign Essential Tremor,6,,"November 16, 2017",16,"I have Essential Tremors since childhood. I had it only in my hands and now that I am 48 years old, it progressed to my head and voice. It’s extremely annoying!!! I had different medications in the past that didn’t work. Now I am taking tramadol 50 mg, gabapentin 300 mg and propranolol. At first, I felt my body less shaky and it felt like it was perfect but after a month or so the tremors came back stronger than before. I will talk to my doctor about medical marijuana. I heard that is very good for people with essential tremors, epilepsy, etc.",JBola
5,Gabapentin,Benign Essential Tremor,9,Taken for less than 1 month,"March 27, 2017",71,I've tried the first line treatments of Propranolol and Primadone several times with little benefit at lower doses. I also didn't like the potential side effects of lowered blood pressure (mine is a healthy low and I don't want to mess with it). One of these meds also had a potential side effect of depression & since I have had severe major depression I didn't want to risk that!!!After discussing this with my Dr. he put me on Gabapentin  300mg at night & after a week 300mg morning & night.I'm 2 weeks into this routine and am amazed at my lack of tremor. I gave Gabapentin a 9 instead of a 10 because I want to see its more longterm benefit.,Creole Lady
6,Gabapentin,Benign Essential Tremor,3,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"January 4, 2017",17,"I have Diabetes Type 2 and Essential Tremors with Diabetic pain in myfeet mostly in my toes and Diabetic nephropathy from my knees down And my left hand wants to bounce around all over the placeSo my Doctor started me at 100 mgs a day but that was totally ineffective.Then they changed it to 300 mgs 3 times a day that worked for awhilebut my legs were driving me nuts and my Essential tremors in my left armwas still going on So then they put me on 600 mgs 3 times a day but nowafter two months it's not effective any more it's like I'm not taking anything atall and now my toes are starting to drive nuts again but not as bad yet and myEssential Tremors is going strong again.

7,Gabapentin,Benign Essential Tremor,6,,"July 11, 2016",32,I've had E T since my late 30's and am in my early 60's now. My dr put me on gabapentin for neuralgia following shingles. We saw it just about stopped my tremors. I've been on 300 mg since then but after the first years it's getting worse where the present dosage is no longer helping. I'm not sure going up a dose will work. Took me 6 months where I wasn't sleeping constantly. The tremors are in my hands and my left is worse but thankfully I'm right handed. It keeps me from doing fine knitting and needlework and sewing takes me so much longer now. Frustrating!,Mybride
8,Gabapentin,Benign Essential Tremor,10,,"March 26, 2016",66,"I am a 51 yr old white female with progressive essential tremors noticeable since about 18 yrs, (neck, head, hand tremors).  At 38 yrs old, I began taking propranolol which helped some but the amount needed to really control the tremor made me too tired to function.  I began gabapentin about 5 years ago and it nearly eliminates my tremor with only low doses.",SDWoman
9,Gabapentin,Benign Essential Tremor,10,,"October 26, 2011",105,I am a 45yr old African American female who has had Essential Tremor since birth. I have tried numerous drugs over the years but found Valium to be my medication to control the tremors until I was prescribed Neurontin and Inderal [for my high blood pressure] about two weeks ago. Neurontin was TOTALLY successful in controlling my hand and body tremors. I was able to carry a large drink that didn't have a lid around with me at a concert this weekend without SPILLING IT and I am SO HAPPY that I was prescribed this medicine. I've heard of it during the last couple of years but finally tried it out. Valium wasn't as effective. Now I will feel so much more confident when I go to my boyfriends family's Thanksgiving dinner...So happy.,Anonymous
