I started with mild essential tremors in my late 20's which later became peripheral neuropathy.  I have little feeling in my lower legs and am no longer able to write.  I take primidone 250mg 4 times daily...it helps somewhat but I guess that's better than not at all.    My neurologist has suggested trying an electrical brain implant.  I'm on the fence.",Mac
1,Primidone,Benign Essential Tremor,2.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"October 13, 2021",3,"I was prescribed this drug nearly 4 weeks ago by my Neurologist as I have essential tremor. I had to start at 1/4 tablet x 2 a day and then increased to 1/2 tablet (125mg) x 2 a day. I take other meds for depression and glaucoma (which he knows about). The first night was awful - nightmares, woke up feeling drowsy (a side effect). It became so bad for me that I was falling over at night, nightmares and feeling foggy/drowsy/nauseous/more depressed/ vertigo and my eyes not being able to focus properly during the day, and my work suffered. My tremors improved but I can't deal with the side effects so have started to slowly wean myself off this drug. Phoned and left a message for my Neurologist but hasn't returned my call. My tremors are returning, but I still have some side effects. Perhaps if I wasn't working and persevered, the side effects would go with more time.",Hope
2,Primidone,Benign Essential Tremor,8.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"October 11, 2021",2,"I started on primidone 3 times daily working up to 50 mg each dose.  My tremors improved greatly but still could be better.  I have just started increasing slowly as prescribed and am now taking 100 mg 3 times daily.  Initially going from 1 3/4 pills to 2 pills my tremors seem to have gotten worse.  I am hoping this is short-term.  If not my ""ideal"" dosage maybe 1 3/4 pills even though that means cutting pills.  Does anyone else find it ironic that a pill to treat tremors doesn't have multiple dosages resulting in people with tremors trying to cut microscopic pills?",57 yo male

4,Primidone,Benign Essential Tremor,8.0,,"July 25, 2021",2,My father and mother had shaking hands. I am 66 and had mild tremors in my hands since my 20s. I went to a neurologist back then who put me on inderal but I didn’t take it due to having side effects of drowsiness. A couple of years ago my tremors got worse. I went back to a neurologist who prescribed Primidone due to having slow heart rate. After 3 days of 50 mg in morning I have seen significant improvement. I am still dosing and taking one in morning and one in evening. I’m very happy that it’s working.,Gail
5,Primidone,Benign Essential Tremor,5.0,Taken for 5 to 10 years,"July 21, 2021",2,"I'm 74 and began to experience right hand tremor 5-6 years ago. It's worst when trying to write (cannot write legibly nowadays). Ignored it at first because the tremor was mild plus I didn't think anything could be done. Because it slowly worsened, I saw my state's ""Expert on Parkinson's and Other Types of Tremors"" (that's what my primary care physician told me). Anyway, Dr. Expert said it's essential, not Parkinson's. I began primidone at 50 mg at night. It immediately helped. After about a year the tremor slowly worsened again, so my neurologist (not Dr. Expert) upped the primidone to 75 mg at night. Slight improvement, but after another year with a gradual retreat to more frequent episodes and worsening tremor, the neurologist suggested going up to 100 mg at night. That was 6 weeks ago, and the tremor hasn't lessened. I've experienced no side effects.",Wayne

At 50 mg, first dose at bedtime, I awoke the next morning with severe dizziness similar to vertigo from inner ear.  Very spacey all day and dizzy.  I stopped it for a few days, then tried 1/2 of the 50mg tablet.  Then I experienced an all night, watery diarrhea requiring several change of clothing and bed covers.  Kaopectate stopped the severe diarrhea.  I was not sure if that reaction was Primidone or Cymbalta which I had been taking for 60 days, but recently increased.  I stopped all meds for a few days, added back Cymbalta with no problems.  Then I took 1/2 tablet of Primidone.  No longer severe dizziness but very intense diarrhea again.  I am through trying Primidone.     The first dose of 50mg Primidone was effective for controlling my tremor.  At half the dose it did not seem to improve much.  Sad I cannot take it.",Willowbrook

They were something I could live with, people  just thought I was nervous all the time.  About 10 years ago they came back with a vengeance.  My neurologist prescribed 100 mg of primidone  twice a day.  They continued to get worse and they added propanolol.  This helped with my tremors but made my blood pressure very low to where I was in the ER twice in one day; falling down and not able to walk a straight line.  We stopped that  med.  I am now on 500 mg twice a day and can hardly function.  I can barely type, very hard to eat, spill things, lose my balance and fall.  Very frustrating but I don't know what else to do.

I have been taking Primidone for 9 mos. At a recent visit with my neurologist, I told him I didn’t believe Primidone was relieving my symptoms. Dose is 100 mg at nite which was an increase from 50 mg at nite. I also take 600 mg of Lithium ER, which can cause tremors. They are worse when I am in a stressful environment. I take .25-.50 Xanax, which helps. We have decided to D/C Primidone 2 re-evaluate Lithium as the root cause. However stopping the Lithium is not an option. I haven’t experienced any side effects.

The neurologist started me at 50 mg and had me increase to 250 mg , which was way to much for me to tolerate , so backed off to 150 mg once at night. It worked somewhat for about 8 years but then began to get panic attacks and the tremors got a lot worse then before I even started primidone. Neurologist recommended to up the dosage, but I was reluctant . So I went to 100mg for a couple of weeks , now am down to 50 mg a day and have found the tremors are dissipating . I know for me this drug is addicting and over time made my tremors way worse. I also believe it can do irreversible damage to your  body. My advice to anyone thinking of taking this or any other drug for essential tremors is think twice and do a lot of research !

So far my kids do not have symptoms. I have been on Primidone for 25 years. I initially started with a low dose of 62.5 (a quarter of a 250mg pill) then slowly over the years increased the dosage until I maxed out at 500 per day (one 250 mg in am and one 250 mg in pm).  It really helped for many years but at the 500mg level after 25 years it no longer works at all (which I am told is normal) so I am weaning myself off the drug under my neurologist's care.

Initially, 50mg was enough to carry me through the day.  After a year, it started to wear off earlier during the day.
