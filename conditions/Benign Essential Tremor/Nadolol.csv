0,Nadolol,Benign Essential Tremor,,Taken for 10 years or more,"February 11, 2022",0,I have been taking nadolol for more than 10 years and I am 74 years of age now.  I started at 40mg per day and now I take 80mg per day as the tremor was breaking through at 40mg.  It works.  Side effects are it makes me tired and my resting heart rate dropped by 10 beats per minute when I started taking it.  It used to be 64 bpm and now it is 54 bpm. The problem is when it comes to sports as nadolol is a beta blocker which means it controls the heart and restricts the flow of blood through the heart.  This means is has dramatically reduced my maximum heart rate during vigorous exercising like cycling.  My maximum heart rate now is only 130 bpm.  Nadolol controls my essential tremor but restricts the blood flow through my heart so I am going to talk to my doctor about trying some alternatives that are not beta blockers.,Mike
1,Nadolol,Benign Essential Tremor,10.0,Taken for 10 years or more,"June 21, 2017",14,"I started this drug 15+ years ago after trying Inderol, Metroprol and others.  It completely controls my tremors, helps my migraines and also helps with PVC's in my heart rate.  I started taking 40mg twice a day, but it has increased to 80 mg twice a day.  I have gone off this and tried other drugs and they did not work as well.",nurse_momma
2,Nadolol,Benign Essential Tremor,9.0,,"February 16, 2016",16,"I was on Primidone for essential tremor, up to 150 mg/day and the tremor was still breaking through.  I asked my doc if we could add a beta blocker b/c I'd read that they help with tremor and also knock down migraine.  Added 20 mg Nadolol per day.  This did the trick - tremor almost completely controlled and migraines decreased dramatically, two for the price of one.I've been on these drugs at this dosage for about 10 years.  Very pleased.  The only side effect is that my tinnitus ramped up.  It drives me nuts, but not as nuts as the tremor and migraines did.  I did get checked out by a hearing specialist to make sure I wasn't losing my hearing.",Laura E.
3,Nadolol,Benign Essential Tremor,10.0,,"November 16, 2009",28,I use this medication only as required and find it totally effective. Sometimes the tremors are random but more often they are triggered by mild anxiety or stress.,jenz
