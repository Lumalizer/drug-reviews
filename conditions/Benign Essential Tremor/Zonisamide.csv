0,Zonisamide,Benign Essential Tremor,7,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"January 27, 2017",6,"My shaking is well controlled but I don't like the side effects I have. I am positive the problems are drug related. I have facial pain, like a sinus pain, nasal burning, occasional headaches, lips and mouth tingle.  I no longer have orgasms.  I have low blood pressure so I couldn't take certain other medications.  A couple others make me very nauseous. I decided to live with the side effects of zonisamide for now.",Mwagne
