0,Inderal,Benign Essential Tremor,9,Taken for 10 years or more,"February 3, 2020",26,"Have had tremor most of my life.  Was diagnosed in my late teens and put on 60mg Inderal LA.  Immediate improvement only real side effect has been a bit of drowsiness so I always take at night.  I have tried the generics because Inderal has gotten so expensive, especially .  The generics just don't work as well, it has to do with the bio-availability which is part of what sets a brand-name drug apart from generics even though they might share the same chemical name.  Regardless, have started buying from Canada. Only down-side is that you have to buy 90 day supply, but it costs same as generic w/good rx discount.  Turned 50 this past year and it just doesn't work quite as well but I knew it would happen.  Considering whether or not to try Neurotin...",highlander739
1,Inderal,Benign Essential Tremor,1,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"March 23, 2017",33,"March 22, 2017 - I took Inderal Oct - Dec 2016 for hand tremors (never helped). I was prescribed 40mg but 1 month later complained of side effects & was prescribed 10mg. While I was on it, I experienced major fatigue (esp. w/ the higher dosage), I was constantly freezing, I just was not myself. Idk when the short term memory loss started, but it is HORRIBLE, & while taking Inderal on the lower dosage, I experienced an episode of what I think was acute psychosis. I read that acute psychosis & short term memory loss could be temporary  or for ever. I'm very scared. I want my memory back, & I'm afraid for my life & others' lives.",Mandy Vicknair
2,Inderal,Benign Essential Tremor,3,,"October 1, 2016",24,"At first it was wonderful. The tremors stopped within 24 hours. The dose was 60 mg in a capsule. After 2 weeks nasty side effects started happening. First was vomitting and diarrhea. Then anxiety, nervousness, trouble sleeping, difficulty talking, and poor memory and concentration.2 days ago my doctor reduced the dose to 40 mg/day. I still feel miserable but will try the lower dose for another few days.Can you give me any advice? Would there be a problem with just stopping the medication?I also take prozac daily.",beckymd
3,Inderal,Benign Essential Tremor,10,Taken for 5 to 10 years,"June 20, 2015",139,"I started experiencing severe tremors as a side effect of other meds. At first I could not brush my teeth, then I had problems typing, next I could not feed myself or even hold a cup of coffee, finally I had bouts of tremors so bad that I could not even walk.I finally ended up seeing a neurologist who once he saw the problem and the severity he immediately prescribed Inderal. Within a week virtually all of my tremors had stopped and I was immensely relieved.I experienced no side effects at all.I have been on them for 7 years now and I only slightly shake if get really tired or drink too much coffee.All in all - I would highly recommend this medication for anyone with severe tremors.",Amgdala
4,Inderal,Benign Essential Tremor,9,Taken for 5 to 10 years,"June 13, 2014",84,"I have benign tremors and hypertension.  I was taking one Inderol LA 60mg daily for the hypertension.  I went to an neurologist about the tremors and he asked my cardiologist to change me to one in the morning and two at night.  That was about 5 years ago.  It has been a great help for the tremors and my BP is awesome! [e.g., 120/75]  Now after so long I have developed a tolerance.  My docs think more per day will make my blood pressure too low. If I am really diligent about taking it the tremors are minimal.",Inderol LA user - long time1
5,Inderal,Benign Essential Tremor,9,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"May 11, 2013",135,"My tremors were getting worse and worse so I went to my Doctor. She thought I had Parkinson's and referred me to a neurologist. The appointment came through about 4 months later. The Neurologist diagnosed Essential Tremor and prescribed Half Inderal 80g once a day. After taking the meds I felt so much better, I still get the shakes but nowhere near so bad. My muscles are stiff though and it's causing me problems walking far and my neck and shoulders hurt too. I'll have to ask whether Inderal is the cause at my next appointment. All in all it's been great, I especially notice the difference when cooking or eating a meal or drinking from a glass, I don't spill as much now and it's less embarrassing when in a restaurant.",Britanichris
6,Inderal,Benign Essential Tremor,2,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"April 28, 2013",32,"I was prescribed Inderal to help with Primary Ortostatic Tremors. I did not get any relief with this medication for that condition. However. I discovered that whenever I stop taking Inderal, I end up with a migraine headache. I take 20 mg at bedtime. It makes me sleepy and gives me nightmares which continue to this day. However, the side effects are tolerable and well worth putting up with to prevent getting migraines. I highly recommend this medication for preventing migraines.",BobbieH
7,Inderal,Benign Essential Tremor,9,,"February 26, 2013",79,"I have had good luck with this medicine but as I age it appears to be less effective, or it may be that my tremors are getting worse and the dosage needs to be increased.  I have tried an increase in the medication and have become very sluggish.  All in all it is working rather well and the cost is low.",Mycocotoo
8,Inderal,Benign Essential Tremor,9,,"November 21, 2011",83,Inderal LA is very very effective.  I have bad tremors and have see neurologist and family physician.  Starting dosage is low then work up.  I take Inderal LA 160 mg once daily.  Sometimes during the day I must also take a Xanax once or twice to help.  But by far the Inderal was the most effective drug I have every taken for tremors.,Anonymous
9,Inderal,Benign Essential Tremor,10,,"June 22, 2011",61,"Propranolol has given me the best tremor control with the least amount of side effects. I tried 4 other medications before my new neurologist suggested this. It's changed my life. No need to increase after 6 months. Some orthostatic hypotension has been an problem, but it seems to be due to mixing this with other medications required for my other health issues.",AnnaMKyle
10,Inderal,Benign Essential Tremor,9,,"February 11, 2010",98,"I had struggled with Benign Essential Tremor for about 7 years (post-trauma), with shaky hands, stuttered speech, etc.  For years I was given Valium or Xanax to treat it.  In an effort to make a career change, I asked my doctor to find a non-narcotic solution.  In short, after seeing a neurologist I was prescribed propranolol and I'm free of almost all symptoms with less side effects and the negative stigma of being prescribed a benzo.",Anonymous
11,Inderal,Benign Essential Tremor,8,,"September 7, 2009",74,"My doctor had me on a regular dose of Inderal, and Valium as a back up if needed.  This was working fine.  When I went in for my annual visit and said everything was as usual, no better but no worse, she changed me to primidone.  I am on my 3rd month of this and feel like a basketcase.  Vertigo, stomach problems, vision problems, memory problems.  ",shakey head
12,Inderal,Benign Essential Tremor,8,,"January 30, 2009",85,"It worked great in the beginning, but within a few months lost its effectiveness, and I needed more and more to get the same effect. I also felt like I was addicted to it. It was the first thing I went for in the morning.",shaky hands
