0,Fluoxetine,Hot Flashes,9.0,Taken for 10 years or more,"January 8, 2022",0,"It really helped me with my depression eating disorders and PTSD. I have been on it for almost ten years now and a year ago began lowering my dosage. No longer feeling the need for such a high one. Once I lowered it I began having hot flashes every night. Very intense ones, soaking wet sheets that need to be changed before I can go back to sleep. Dr says this could be life long now.",Farmer
1,Fluoxetine,Hot Flashes,9.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"October 16, 2021",0,"Really effective! I was having hot flushes every 15 minutes through the night and I was absolutely exhausted, I didn’t want HRT due to breast cancer in my family and the pill not agreeing with me in the past, I felt a little spacey in the first few weeks and after 6 months my hot flushes are few and far between, I have put on weight but I do seem to be eating like the store horse these days?!!

It's possible these take longer to work with some people so if it has only been a few months for some people I'd say give it a bit longer for them to kick in.

9,Fluoxetine,Hot Flashes,8.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"November 1, 2019",9,"I was prescribed this about 4 years ago as I started an early menopause.  I was a bit reluctant with them being anti-depressants.  However, after a few months I realised that one of the reasons I can't sleep is that I am really tense.  I suddenly became aware of my clenched fists and jaw when I was trying to sleep.  I had the best sleep ever, but strangely woke up feeling really tired!  I stopped taking these because of the stigma of being depressed.  I'm now 51 and still suffering from hot flushes etc so am considering seeing my GP to give them another try, although prescriptions are so expensive!",clc

When my doctor suggested these anti depressants I was  like but I'm not depressed! I'm just menopausal!

I have been having some issues that are sending me to oncology and talk of leukemia.  About 2 months ago I stopped going on Prozac just to clear out my body with a few different meds.  Night sweats were one deal that my oncology doc brought up (I have the mutated gene for all the ! and ? to go up about leukemia, but have not had the bone marrow test yet, only because I am a wimp) and I have flashes throughout the night, but she is saying sheet wetting sweats.

31,Fluoxetine,Hot Flashes,10.0,,"May 7, 2016",63,"At 27 my ovaries were removed which sent me into abrupt and severe menopause. For 9 years I suffered debilitating hot flashes and not even the hormones seemed to work. Few doctors were comfortable prescribing them anyway, I often had to beg for my medication. About two weeks ago I began taking Prozac,  and noticed almost immediately my flashes were less frequent, less intense, and less in duration. Last night I covered up in bed and waited purposefully for the flash. All I felt was a warming and never even broke a sweat. Usually I get so hot my skin feels like it's being pricked because my capillaries are bursting. The flashes are gone. After a decade of suffering I'm finally free. I wish a doctor would have told me this information before.",happy lady 2016
32,Fluoxetine,Hot Flashes,10.0,Taken for 10 years or more,"May 1, 2016",41,"I knew years ago when I started on fluoxetine for depression and anxiety how it helped my hot flushes (as we in NZ call them) not only that but it helped by fibromyalgia.  So it killed not two birds with one stone but 3.  I tried to come off the drug last year by weaning myself  for 8 months. Wasn't successful so went back on them.  More so just recently I was given Lovan at the chemist and never thought much of it being another generic of Prozac. But, I started to go down hill, with anxiety, sore bones, headaches and worse of all hot flushes.  Finally I put 2 and 2 together and realised it was the Lovan.  So now I'm back on  fluoxetine. So being Generic doesn't mean the same for everybody! This should be publised more for all.",kiwikazza

35,Fluoxetine,Hot Flashes,9.0,,"February 12, 2016",38,I didn't want to take hormones for hot flashes but the hot flashes were bad enough that I was going to try hormone therapy anyway. My family doctor suggested fluoxetine or Prozac for hot flashes. I had never heard of taking an antidepressant for hot flashes before so I studied before saying yes. It started working after just a few days. I have occasional hot flashes that are milder than before an way way less frequent. 20 mg is the dose that works for me. I tried reducing to 10 mg for a few months but it didn't work as well as the 20 mg. I have been on this for 16 months now. On the flip side it has also helped with some anxiety issues I didn't realize I was experiencing. : ),radicalbuff
