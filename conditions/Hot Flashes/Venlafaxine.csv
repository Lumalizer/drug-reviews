My gynecologist presented this medication or estrogen/progesterone to help with the increase of hot flashes & edgy feeling associated with perimenopause. I chose venlafaxine over HRT due to concerns about HRT.The first two weeks: mild nausea, much improved sleep (less waking), hot flashes reduce by 1/3. The hot flashes at night were significantly reduced, or I slept through them. I just slept better.The second two weeks: no nausea. Sleep is decent again. I wake once per night if I drink too much water before sleep. Hot flashes are reduced by 1/3, but not in intensity.Overall, I feel better. I feel less crabby and am not as quick to snap. I have about 1/3 fewer hot flashes & I feel like I can cope better when these occur. I feel rested when I wake up after sleep. I take this with breakfast. I disengage with social media more easily. I feel clearer. So far, a decent choice.",Tillita F.

I tried other natural, herbal supplements but they wouldn't control my hot flashes. I tried soy milk and Estradol with zero benefits.",Christie

I’ve taken 3 extra days off work after the weekend so I could relax and sleep if need be.  I’m doing well and won’t be taking them ever again.

14,Venlafaxine,Hot Flashes,1.0,,"February 14, 2020",13,"Beware! This drug is dangerous!  My doctor prescribed venlafaxine for severe hot flashes.  I took it for a couple years.  It helped somewhat and lessened the anxiety that preceded every hot flash episode, but all I wanted to do was eat and sleep 12 hours a day.  Big weight gain.  And vivid crazy dreams.  The worst was trying to get off the drug even though I did it very gradually over a 3 month period.  It was a nightmare.  It took a full year to stop having withdrawal symptoms.   I was miserable, angry, agitated, and I lost friends.  My brain has never been the same since.  This drug should be taken off the market.  I've had nasty hot flashes for 15 years.  So far the only thing that worked was HRT but you can't stay on that forever.  Also, evening primrose oil capsules work really well, without side effects.",Dino

My doctor didn't tell me 1) Don't take this later in the day, it can impair your ability to fall asleep.  For months after starting it, it took 2-3 hours to fall asleep nightly.  I did some web research on my own and learned to take it no later than early afternoon.  When I told my doctor she said ""I'm sorry I forgot to tell you about that"". While traveling, I ran out and didn't take the medicine for two days.  I got home from my trip, felt very depressed; I was crying for no reason.  My friends picked up my refill (I felt so bad I didn't even want to leave the house) and I felt better once I resumed taking it.  Once again, my doctor failed to provide critical information. I am weaning myself off of it and am now at the point where what used to be one day's dose is now split into 5 days doses, I step down to a lesser amount in a gel capsule every 10 days.

This time I was more determined so properly weaned myself off of it. Having said that I got passed the headaches nausea and diarrhea but I have been very anxious and nervous since I went off of it and the hot flashes returned and are worse than ever.

I went into menopause in 2009 and started effexor xr for hot flashes (HF) as that seemed my only menopause symptom.  Doc said to stay on it and give it a good 10 year try. That seemed excessive to me but I thought I will go ahead and try it. Well, I continued to have HF but hoped things would change. They never did. The doc had me on 150mg, until I finally told him several weeks ago, no more....that I gave it 10 years to work and that's my limit! So, he gradually reduced me to 75mg and then to 37mg and then, this week, I finally stopped. I still have HF and NOW I have terrible nightsweats!!!

I was incredibly grateful, was able to sleep through the night as well. Just recently, they started to become unbearable again, so they increased the dosage. Really does work.
