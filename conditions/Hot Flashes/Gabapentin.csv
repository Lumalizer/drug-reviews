0,Gabapentin,Hot Flashes,10.0,,"March 25, 2022",1,"I first read about gabapentin in 2002, after I developed unbelievable hot flashes after being put on Tamoxifen when I was pre menopausal. One long uninterrupted meltdown day and night.  Sweating through all my clothes, hair always wet, followed by freezing cold spells before the next hot flash kicked in. I was almost suicidal. I begged for the gabapentin and they finally gave it to me. It's been a godsend. It doesn't eliminate the hot flashes, but it mitigates them and and I take 800 mg every 4 hours round the clock. Have been doing so for 20 years and I don't seem to have any bad effects from it. If I skip the Gabapentin even for a few hours, my hot flashes are back with a vengeance. Surely someone can figure this out, but until they do, I'm sticking with gabapentin.",Grace
1,Gabapentin,Hot Flashes,10.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"December 28, 2021",0,"Night sweats were reduced immediately, and by 2 weeks, I was not having night sweats or daytime hot flashes.  This was on just one 300mg nighttime dose. The initial sedating effects were excessive, but they were less of a problem after 2 or 3 weeks.  I had to cut back on my usual sleeping medication.",SLL
2,Gabapentin,Hot Flashes,4.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"November 12, 2021",0,"I heard a lot of great things about how Gabapentin can really help reduce hot flashes/ night sweats.  I have been suffering with horrible night sweats for 5 years.  My doctor prescribed 300 mg before bedtime to start.   It did help with the night sweats quite a bit -  but still have one or two during the night, so DR said to increase the dosage to 600 mg per night.   That helped a lot, but I started to experience horrible anxiety and terrible nightmares/ waking with anxiety.  Plus my vision was starting to become blurred and after about three months of taking this drug I developed a bald patch in the back of my hair.  My doctor said that I could be in the 1% of people who experience these side effects.  So, I am starting to wean off this medication all together.  But it makes me sad because it did actually work quite well for the night sweats.  But the other side effects are just to risky.",In the woods

4,Gabapentin,Hot Flashes,10.0,,"August 23, 2021",1,"For me, gabapentin has been extremely effective in controlling hot flashes and night sweats. Within a week, my hot flashes had decreased in intensity and frequency to the point where I could actually sleep. I was having three or four severe hot flashes each night, and would have to change my clothes due to sweat. When I started gabapentin, I would have one or two a night, but they never went anywhere. I would feel the heat in my hands, with a little bit of a tingle, and then often that was it. It was like the drug stopped the hot flash right in its tracks. I am very thankful that this drug has been so effective for me. I'm about to start hormone suppression medication for breast cancer, and I am hopeful that gabapentin will be able to handle the potentially increased hot flashes, a common side effect, as well. I initially used estrogen to handle hot flashes but then was unable to continue due to the breast cancer tumor being sensitive to estrogen. I only wish I had used it sooner!",KitKate
5,Gabapentin,Hot Flashes,10.0,,"August 5, 2021",1,"Wow I am so blown away by Gabapentin that I searched for a way to review it online. Took it for nerve impingement in my neck, and the very first night I slept well for the first tine in 4 months—and the first time I didn’t wake up in the the middle of the night drenched in sweat! Last night, second night, same thing. Totally eradicated night sweats.",Sara
6,Gabapentin,Hot Flashes,10.0,,"July 30, 2021",2,"The medication helps immensely with hot flashes,  however.... I'm experiencing some extremely serious side effects, depression, anxiety and suicidal thoughts. I'm only 33, 34 in September, I went through chemotherapy and a stem cell transplant which most likely damaged my ovaries and pushed me into early menopause. The oncologist wants to wait a year post transplant to start hormone therapy. I get the relief from the hot flashes but is it worth all the emotional and mental rubbish?

14,Gabapentin,Hot Flashes,8.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"February 24, 2020",15,This drug helps my post menopause symptoms tremendously. My hot flashes cause my rosacea symptoms to flare sooo bad. My face and eyes burn like they are on fire if I don’t take this drug. It’s great for insomnia also!  I sleep like a baby. Without it I toss and turn all night.  It also helps my terrible moodiness that comes with my menopause.  It is prescribed for my back pain but it helps so many other things for me along with helping the back pain.  The one thing I absolutely hate about this drug is it causes all over swelling which is why I keep going off of it. It also causes constipation but I can take my linzess or miralax to counteract that problem. It also causes me to eat enormous amounts of food. It’s almost like it turns off the full receptors in my stomach. But other than these terrible side effects I still love this drug.,February 2020

I was prescribed HRT, which worked great to alleviate symptoms, but it got too expensive for me to continue. I've been off it a few years and I went to doctor to discuss continuing symptoms. She prescribed 100-200 mg of gabapentin at bedtime to help with night sweats. I've been taking 100 mg for 3 months. It works great! It has eliminated most of my daytime hot flashes too. My quality of life is so much better! My doctor warned that my body might get used to it and it will stop working. She suggests I not take every night. I try to take it 5 of every 7 days.

23,Gabapentin,Hot Flashes,8.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"June 17, 2019",25,Started on this last weekend as been majorly struggling with daytime hot flushes and night sweats. Could not believe the result after just two doses. I'm only on 100mg tablets and can take between 1 and 3 a day. Because of the drowsiness side effect I've chosen to only take them in the evening. I took one at 7 and another at 9.30 and went to bed at 10.30/11. Woke up at 9.30 the next day. Didn't wake up ONCE with hot flushes and slept all the way through. It's a miracle! LOL. I woke up feeling amazing and so well refreshed. My only advice would be to be careful with your timing as I took it late last night after coming back from the cinema and I'm feeling really sleepy today.  But - so far so good. No hot flushes since starting the drug and really good sleep.,sprocks

25,Gabapentin,Hot Flashes,10.0,Taken for 10 years or more,"April 6, 2019",30,"As little as 300mg, 3x/day, or less times a day (like whenever you find yourself sweating, take 300mg) will abso-flipping-LUTE-ly STOP hot flashes AND/OR menopausal/post-menopausal sweats/flushing, PERIOD.It also helps reduce side-effects of opiate withdrawal, if your doctor also idiotically prescribed them to help; this actually exacerbates the problem. Remember you’ll need to THEN WEAN OFF THE GABAPENTIN, once you find yourself free and clear of other problems. Per my pharmacist, THAT IS 25%, every 14 days; keep a mini spiral pad in your purse, with four columns: Date:  Time:  Amt:  Symtms:  Reduce by 1/4, every 15 days, except if you have hot flashes/sweats, due to menopause. In that case you may have to wean off and then decide if you can handle the hot flashes/sweats. If not, restart gabapentin at 300mg whenever you feel sweats. Maintain it til you find you can withdraw without sweats returning (I’m 57 and STILL am having post-menopausal sweats without gabapentin).",Muse

I have maybe five flashes per DAY and they are definitely less severe.  I can live with them.

102,Gabapentin,Hot Flashes,10.0,,"March 29, 2014",112,My night time hot flashes were keeping me from sleeping.  I would have 4 or 5 episodes a night.  My Dr. Prescribed Neurontin and within 2 days my hot flashes have disappeared.  I only take this medication at night as it makes me drowsy.  I take 200 mg.  It  is a miracle!!!,Christina11
103,Gabapentin,Hot Flashes,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"January 20, 2014",139,"Started taking this for hot flashes a couple of weeks ago.  I'm on 300mg twice a day and it is wonderful.  I would sometimes get more than 4 hot flashes per hour- I felt like a chameleon.  I had no idea how nice it is to be almost completely hot flash free!  I'm post menopause at 48 and started having flashes at 37.  After awhile it becomes a fact of life, if I had under 10 flashes in a day I thought that was good.  When I started having 2-4 per hour in the afternoons, sometimes more than 30 during waking hours, my oncologist prescribed this.  I can't take hormones because of high risk breast cancer.  Gabapentin is giving me my life back!!!!!",lglavish

106,Gabapentin,Hot Flashes,8.0,,"January 2, 2013",101,"I was prescribed gabapentin two years ago to help with night sweats, coincidentally I noticed that having always had mild to moderate anxiety I was much calmer and only became anxious as a result of a problem or crisis. recently I had an illness with nausea and loss of appetite, so stopped all my medications for 2 weeks. My anxiety went through the roof with panic attacks almost constantly, I have since found stopping Gabapentin abruptly is a no no, I took one 300mg last night and feel like my old self already, having had a nights sleep, after 2 weeks of insomnia. I think Gabapentin works extremely well, and I have no side effects. I hope my Dr doesn't ever want me to stop taking them, but if he does I now know it has to be a gradual process.",lops

I thought maybe it was in my head that I was getting some relief. Saw my gynecologist today and she would not prescribe it for me. She was not familiar with this medicine or that it helped hot flashes. Interesting! I found out about the medicine while using it for nerve pain, even my pain doctor was skeptical about it helping with menopause symptoms. The secret is out, there is help out there that is not hormones.",Hot on M.D.

I started taking gabapentin ER for a research study on hot flashes.  It was a miracle drug for me.  The hot flashes almost stopped completely after just 1 week of taking this medicine.  The study lasted for 6 months, and then I was taken off cold turkey.  The withdrawl was horrible.  Hot flashes, couldn't sleep, and just over all irritable to say the least.  I went to my regular doctor and was prescribed gabapentin 600mg.  Again the hot flashes subsided. It is the only medication that I take.  The best part of taking this medication is that my energy level has sky rocketed. At 49 years old, I feel 30.",Young Again

When the generic came out, I began taking it. I began experiencing menopause symptoms within two months. I was 36 years old at that time. Three months ago my neurologist put me back on the name brand. My symptoms have diminished greatly, but not completely. I think my condition is unique in that I took this medication while still in child bearing age. When my age increased, something about the generic formulations bio-availability actually induced menopause symptoms. I also know that the name brand is working as evidenced by weight gain which can be brought back down with exercise. I had lost weight, sleep, memory and sanity while on the generic.",Nice Kilt
