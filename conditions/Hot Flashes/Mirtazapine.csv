0,Mirtazapine,Hot Flashes,1,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"September 21, 2020",8,"I started taking mirtazapine in September ‘19 for depression, related insomnia and nausea. It worked so great that I went off it after 6 months. I was recently put back on it for the same issues, it’s not working, and I’m having several hot flashes daily and some night sweats. My opinion of the drug has completely changed. I hate it.",MuttsMom
1,Mirtazapine,Hot Flashes,3,,"January 30, 2020",5,"I began to experience severe hot flashes when taking Mirtazapine... I never had any symptoms of Menopause until taking Mirtazapine, if you are still in your early 40's and may want children or you just don't feel like menopausing early I highly advise against taking Mirtazapine!",Moonchild
2,Mirtazapine,Hot Flashes,7,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"October 19, 2019",11,Menopause mood swings were very bad so I . started on 7.5mg of mirtazapine at night. Wonderful sleep now on 15mg but can not control my eating so have gained 14lbs in 1 month. I urgently need to discuss with doc. I am too small framed to carry thus weight. Sadly I feel it will not be a long term solution for me.,Anonymous
3,Mirtazapine,Hot Flashes,8,Taken for 10 years or more,"June 5, 2018",21,"I have taken mirtazapine since 2006, both to reduce my severe face flushing (rosacea) as well as to help with depression and anxiety. It works very well for all of those 3 for me. I noticed an improvement within weeks and I love how it took away the deepest depths of my depression, without numbing me or altering my personality. My anxiety is also significantly reduced and I no longer flush and burn all the time (I'd say it helps reduce about 50% of them). I also sleep like a log on it, typically 8 to 9 hours straight, with very pleasant and lively dreams. It took a good few months however to get over the side effects of drowsiness, tiredness, itchy legs, even some 'brain zaps' in the beginning. The only side effect I notice is increased appetite, never feeling full, always being hungry and despite sticking to the same amount of calories as before; weight gain. I know that is the biggest fear of many people. But the quality of life this med gave me outweigh (lol) to the downsides.",Natushka
