1,Citalopram,Hot Flashes,10.0,Taken for 5 to 10 years,"September 16, 2021",1,"I was diagnosed with stage 2 breast cancer in 2015 and because my cancer was hormone positive, I was forced into menopause. The hot flashes were so intense I would throw up, and then I learned that some women have them for more than 10 years. My cancer treatment nurse told me there are some antidepressants that mess with the thermal receptors in the brain and stop  hot flashes, so after two years of not being able to sleep and having several hot flashes every hour during daytime hours, I did some research and asked my doctor for citalopram... he also prescribed me gabapentin for night flashes. By my fourth day taking citalopram my hot flashes stopped and I had no need to take the gabapentin because it also put an end to my night sweats. However, after about 6 months I noticed it stopped working so I upped my dose to 40 mg and it has worked wonders since. This is a miracle for Peri and Post menopausal women who cannot take hormones.",FireWoman

Was prescribed it by my Doctor after I'd had 3 months of interrupted sleep due to nightly hot flushes accompanied with overwhelming anxiety at the same time.

I felt exhausted all day and at night fall asleep then wide awake an hour later kicking covers off and on. Dr. recommended low dosage and after a few jittery days I was sleeping most of the night and feeling rested in the morning. It's been almost a month and I am so happy to have found something that works. No more expensive supplements that don't even work.,G Smith
