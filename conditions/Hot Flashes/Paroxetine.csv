1,Paroxetine,Hot Flashes,2.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"January 13, 2022",0,"My PA prescribed this med for hot flashes. I took it for a few weeks & was delighted with the improvement in my sleep quality. My hot flashes decreased in intensity. However, two weeks in, I began to feel malaise and a sour stomach. I didn’t put it together until 26 doses that the medication was causing excess stomach acid, headaches and nausea. I researched side effects and realized it was paroxetine causing me to feel sick. I also felt woozy and doped up. My nausea caused vomiting which burned my throat. I flushed the capsules down the toilet almost four weeks in. It took a week to escape the mental fog. I felt like my brain was peeling itself out of a latex cast for a week. My stomach was so bad, I developed a bleeding ulcer. I required proton pump inhibitor an anti nausea medicine after 26 doses. Quitting cold seemed like the best way vs tapering off bc my stomach was raw, full, bloated and nauseous. I threw up. I need a GI consult now. Rather have hot flashes. No go. Not for me.",MensaBarbie

I've tried natural supplements, but no relief. My primary care manager refused to prescribe any more hormones. But she did suggest paroxetine. I got the prescription filled but did not take it when I found out it is Paxil. I had taken Paxil years ago for depression/stress. It did not go well due to many reasons. But, after no longer being able to deal with the hot flashes, night sweats, no sleep, I started, with a lot of research, the Paroxetine, 10mg every morning. And after 2 weeks I can say that it is going well. Very well. Hot flashes have almost completely stopped. No more waking up in a sweaty puddle, I sleep through the night now. There is no drowsiness or mood swings, no fogginess. I feel so much better. Remarkably so. It was not immediate but has gotten better day by day.",Relieved

8,Paroxetine,Hot Flashes,7.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"May 9, 2020",18,"I originally was treating my hot flashes with Estroven, which worked for several months. When it stopped working, I decided to increase the dosage of the active ingredients,  black cohosh and soy isoflavones.  That worked for several months and then stopped working. My doctor then prescribed 10 mg of Paroxetine, and it was like a miracle drug. I went from several hot flashes a day and waking up for five times a night to maybe one very mild hot flash per day. It was the greatest thing. But now, after about nine months, it seems to have stopped working. It’s very frustrating. Hot flashes are coming back even though I continue to take the meds. I don’t think I’ve had a lot of side effects, except I have realized I can’t cry, no matter how stressed, angry or sad I get. It’s weird.",ScarlettJ

I really like how mellow I feel , less moody, over all happier.  I started this medication to help with hot flashes. Now I don’t think I have but one a week, it was 2-3 a day. I think it’s really helped with the hot flashes. I’ve experienced some of the side affects, muscle - joint pain , breathing heavier than normal especially when I go to sleep. When I do fall asleep I sleep like I haven’t slept in decades oh that’s  because I also have insomnia if I don’t take the medication. Sometimes I take it just to fall asleep. This can’t be good but what’s worse is my eye twitches like muscle spasms sometimes all day other times off and on  through out the day. I’m over the eye twitching.

On day four, I woke-up feeling somewhat human, only to have it return with a vengeance within a few hours. By the end of the day, at a friend's home, I was on her bathroom floor and convinced I was dying. Not only was the headache almost unbearable, but I also had a stabbing pain in my left eye. My husband managed to get me home, but not before I threw-up in the car. I had chills and pain all night long. After investigating the side effects, we've decided this is not the medication for me.

I live in fl & this makes life hell as it is already extremely hot here. Night sweats were insane. Fatigue, bloating etc etc. Almost instantly after taking this med I noticed a huge difference. I was able to turn my air conditioner from 63 up to 70 last night, and didn’t need my floor fan or ceiling fans. It kept me awake most of last night. I do feel like I’m extremely alert.... a ringing in my ears and a swooshing sound in my head. I can’t wait until the 4-5 weeks when these side effects will go away. I am happier dealing with the minor effects than the all day long hot flashes. I was always so embarrassed to go anywhere, see people etc because I was constantly sweating and then my under garments would be drenched and when I would go into the grocery store or anywhere with air conditioning I’d then freeze. There was no balance whatsoever and now there is!!!!!!",Mistee37

I experienced all the symptoms mentioned in other comments which includes vertigo  symptoms with the room spinning a couple of nights, fatigue, swooshing sound in head, sensitivity  to light, headaches, etc. I have been off this medicine three weeks and still feeling fatigue, nauseous, light headedness, head tremors/zaps and most of all feeling weird.

No more hot flashes.  Started gradual use at one tablet every other day while weaning off Rx Estradiol 2mg.  After two weeks, dosage is daily.  Taken at bedtime.The only negative side effect experienced with the first pill was waking up drowsy and lethargic lasting throughout the day.  This was quickly remedied this by cutting pill in half; taking half at bedtime, and half next day at noon with food.The 7.5mg Brisdelle brand is very costly and out of my budget.

29,Paroxetine,Hot Flashes,1.0,,"August 12, 2017",9,I had wonderful results with hormone therapy but after 5 years my Doc told me to wean off. Did so in 3 weeks. Then 2 years of sleep loss due to constant hot flashes all night long. My new Doc suggested Brisdelle. My insurance covers beautifully so I only pay $3 monthly. But it didn't work. I was woozy during the day and slept heavily but with terrible dreams that woke me and then I had great difficulty going back to sleep. And still had hot flashes. After 2 1/2 months I said thanks but no thanks. No need for extra medication if it's not working. The dreams and their after effects are debilitating- re-living them through the day. So I'm weaning off and feeling extra woozy. First week every other day then every third day for another week.,GrownUpMom
30,Paroxetine,Hot Flashes,10.0,,"June 26, 2017",22,I have to review this medication in hopes women that are suffering with menopausal symptoms may be helped. I read some pretty bad reviews on this drug so I was reluctant to try it. But in the the two weeks that I have taken Brisale my mood has improved and my hot flashes have been reduced to about 1 to 2 a day. Also they are less severe. The night sweats have been reduced to maybe 1 episode per night when before I had 4 to 5. Also my mood is so much better and I feel like my energy has increased. The only drawback is the $200.00 a month cost but I'm increasing my HSA  to pay for this drug because I  feel so much better.,Joe'smommy

My Dr. told me to wean myself off it, but since it comes only in capsule form, and only comes in one strength, that is difficult to do. I went from 1xday to every other day then stopped.

It took about 60 days, but I have 85% reduction of in symptoms in ""the sweats"" and irritability. This is a slow-release and small dosage of an antidepressant. Therefore, the anti-depression action should be very minimal. If a physician is prescribing Paroxetine at 10mg or greater and stating that it should help with menopausal symtoms, it is helping more with depression and anxiety.  Paroxetine CR 12.5mg or higher is also more for depression/anxiety.
