0,Seroquel,Schizoaffective Disorder,5.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"November 4, 2021",4,"If you are forced to pick an anti-psychotic then take this one. You can sleep through the hospital or jail time when you take seroquel extended release. Avoid aripiprazole, haldol, paliperidone and all the other ones. Seroquel is most least worse of all anti-psychotics doesn't block dopamine as much as all the others. Sedation is pretty heavy so take it at night time.",Doug
1,Seroquel,Schizoaffective Disorder,1.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"October 3, 2021",3,1 of the worst meds I've ever taken was only on 25-50 milligrams a day made me extremely tired and my eyes black.  I'd wakeup feeling like I was being choked.  If I was trying to workout doing push ups for instance I'd get a sharp pain in my head and either my arm or leg or both would give out and I'd fall to the floor almost hurting myself.  I thought it was bad for me or I must be allergic to it so I had to refuse to take it anymore after a couple months. I can't believe they are still giving this to people without knowing how destructive it can be to people's lives. It's an older antipsychotic medicine they claim so how could they not know the brutal side effects it causes.,Survivor
2,Seroquel,Schizoaffective Disorder,10.0,Taken for 5 to 10 years,"August 4, 2021",1,"If my diagnosis of schizoaffective disorder (bipolar type) is correct .... then Seroquel is working better for me, than Invega did. Invega is the only drug currently approved for schizoaffective disorder, but .... I predict, in 2021, that Seroquel WILL eventually be approved for schizoaffective disorder too. I am allowed to take 600mg to 800mg of Seroquel daily/nightly, and it works better, and more consistently for me than taking Invega daily by pill or capsule.",Stusky
3,Seroquel,Schizoaffective Disorder,8.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"July 13, 2021",2,"I had a nervous breakdown February 2020. I had to do 20 days inpatient. They gave me Invega, which did not work at all. After I was released, I still wasn't right at all. I ended up even getting arrested for criminal trespassing. I started doing therapy, and met with a medical provider. I asked to be put on Seroquel, because I could not sleep at all. I take 200mg a day, and it's very effective in stopping racing thoughts. You have to really watch what you eat on it. I have worked very hard to have gained zero weight. I also continue to take Doxepin, which I was previously prescribed.",Lou

5,Seroquel,Schizoaffective Disorder,6.0,Taken for 5 to 10 years,"January 19, 2021",6,"I started seroquel when I was 13 after 7 years of talking to people who weren't there. I'm 18 now. I heard it's not possible to need this at that age but here I am. I think at first I was kinda empty, didn't talk, kinda a vegetable. Took about a while to get used to, maybe a week, then I remember completely losing it and attacking my brother and also feeling suicidal, but I didn't stop taking it when I was put in inpatient. Then everything got better, now I still hear and see things but only specific things and I talk to people more even though I have social anxiety. So it didn't really work for my hallucinations just maybe depression and anxiety.",Bunny
6,Seroquel,Schizoaffective Disorder,5.0,Taken for 10 years or more,"January 3, 2021",20,"I have been on Seroquel 600 mg a day for  over 15 years. During that time, the drug has been effective. However, towards the end of 2020, I decided to have my eyes checked for the first time. I was having some farsightedness in my left eye. I am 37 years old and I have never had eye problems. Never been to an eye doctor. The doctor told me I had a cataract which is unusual for my age. She was baffled.  It wasn’t until later that I learned that cataracts are a rare side effect of seroquel. Not only that, Seroquel increased my AST/ liver enzymes and decreased my T4 levels, both rare side effects. It is even possible that it has contributed to my acid reflux.  The herculean effort is tapering off this medication while being able to sleep. I can’t give this drug a high score because of the problems it has caused and the extreme difficulty of getting off of it.  The drug has been very effective, but that has come at a high price.  I can’t get off Seroquel fast enough.",Patient#139
7,Seroquel,Schizoaffective Disorder,10.0,,"October 15, 2020",18,"I started this drug at age 19 when I was first diagnosed with schizotypal personality disorder and been taking it for 5 years. I haven’t noticed any positive changes at first since you have to give the drug couple of weeks to kick in. When it did kicked in, this drug changed my life. I was more positive, outgoing and overall in the elevated state of mind. The only downside to this drug was weight gain and too much sleep time. I’d still keep taking but it stopped working for me. Now I just feel really horrible on it. Definitely give this drug a try though.",Bruce
8,Seroquel,Schizoaffective Disorder,9.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"September 13, 2020",71,"Seroquel saved my life. I was diagnosed with schizoaffective disorder at 16 ( I'm 18 now) and I’ve tried almost all second-generation antipsychotics since I was 13. ALL made me experience horrid side effects (extrapyramidal effects, paranoia, vomiting, emotionally flat). Seroquel within 2 days of taking it helped me feel relatively normal...with NO akathisia/extrapyramidal effects. I can sleep, I don’t feel anywhere as paranoid, the delusions have significantly decreased. The only thing that is a little funky is the hunger, but I can manage that. This drug has helped me live a normal life. I’m at 300mg now and this is my safe spot. For anyone considering this medication, go for it. It’s the only antipsychotic that has not made me crawl out of my skin and die mentally. Genuinely a wonderful drug.",Matt

I tried, invega (that was bad) with unsuccessful results.I take Queatipine at a dose of 50mg at night and it makes me so much more relaxed and without any kind of bad feelings or thoughts. If you wanna be healthy and active during your days, this drug is highly recommended. In my case is used during night before sleep. It works!",lipelips
10,Seroquel,Schizoaffective Disorder,10.0,,"April 28, 2020",74,"10 years ago, while in college, I had a marijuana induced psychosis (didn't know this was possible) & wound up in the ER. Don't remember 95% of events but apparently I thought the hospital staff was trying to kill me, was uncooperative & pulling IVs out of my arm.  They had an officer restrain me & he decided it was a good idea to tase me in the head.  I fell down and suffered a fractured skull, concussion & the next day my nightmare began.  I developed PTSD, couldn't sleep, panic attacks, hyper-vigilance etc. I was close to ending my life when I found a $300/hr Psych. who started me on Seroquel immediately. Within 24hrs I felt almost as good as before the incident happened. I was on it for a year and stopped as the doc told me I could stop if I didn't have any psychoses in that time. Very grateful for that doc and Seroquel. Everyone should have medical care like I found regardless of their ability to pay $300/hr; fortunately my parents could afford it.",Sam
11,Seroquel,Schizoaffective Disorder,1.0,,"February 15, 2020",51,"Seroquel knocked me out so bad that I slept 18 hours... the heavy sedation effect does go away though. It did not help at all with my schizophrenia. But it did make me put on a lot of weight.Altogether, antipsychotics have made me put on a ton of weight. I've tried many of them. And I used to weigh 160 pounds and now am 220... so far that's all these drugs have done to me, they should be called fat pills.",Druger

Sure beats  laying awake all night overthinking things. I don't know what I'd do without it, probably stay up for several days and have another manic episode.

16,Seroquel,Schizoaffective Disorder,2.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"December 20, 2017",16,"Seroquel did not work for me (this is NOT to say it may work for you, because everyone's biochemistry is different). It caused me to sleep 16 hours a day or more on a extremely low dose (75 mg), and over 2 weeks caused me to auditory hallucinate and creepy or hellish nightmares (worse than my normal ones). Over time it actually caused anxiety instead of reducing it. Hope you have a better time with Seroquel than me!",dynamiterocket

Later, while in a combination of other meds, I took the courage to play around with 300/400 mgs. of XR, and, to my surprise, I still got a precise dosage - no racing thoughts, sound sleep, no anxiety, much attenuated paranoia, and an awesome anti-depressant effect with half of the original 800.",Anonymous

It controlled all my symptoms, paranoia, visual and auditory hallucinations, tactile hallucinations and anxiety. Absolutely no weight gain. I lost 30 pounds on this medication and could not be happier that I tried the drug. It also works excellently for people with eating disorders, controlling their cravings and regulating their eating patterns. There were no sexual side effects. I never relapsed when I went off the medication with the help of my psychiatrist. Thank you makers of seroquel!",Anonj26

23,Seroquel,Schizoaffective Disorder,9.0,,"December 31, 2015",21,"I have a complicated relationship with this drug. On one hand, I've been on everything for depression (specifically), and nothing helped. I'm talking like 20  medications here, so it's been a rollercoaster.  most antidepressants were useless for me and the time period for effectiveness is usually over 1 month. Seroquel usually takes 2 weeks to start having an effect. It works for my depression - but I'm sedated and have to sleep a lot. Being a student can make this challenging. shift work and the like would be hard too. It's my last bet for now because I literally start to crumble to psychosis without it. However it is debilitating and feels restrictive. Beats the psych ward I guess.    good luck and keep trying,  sometimes it takes a while.",Rayacccc

26,Seroquel,Schizoaffective Disorder,,,"April 27, 2015",29,I take seroquel and have taken higher doses when I was heavier at 300 lbs I was taking 900mg and my new doc cannot believe my psychiatrist was prescribing me that high of a dose just to help me sleep. Once I had weight loss surgery I could only handle about 150mg I am up to 300mg. The thing I like best about seroquel is it will knock you out and you will get good sleep. Now occasionally I have taken one and a half pills if I want to fall asleep quicker but you really have to be careful with this drug because many things can happen. The side effects I've experienced mainly is trouble swallowing which scares me to death when I'm trying to sleep and I'm panicking & my heartbeats racing yet I can't swallow. So be very careful with dosages.,headdy20

I've taken Seroquel for two years, and let me tell you you can stay fit and or lose weight! The hardest is the munchies at night, but if you can control that and or snack healthy you will be FINE. You don't have to have a strict diet on this medication. Exercise and eat healthy as much as you can. You can still enjoy giving into cravings! You have to adjust to the major hunger especially at night. See what works for you. This medicine is amazing and works very well. Just give it a chance.

It took about 15 years to get seen, by that time I was completely detached from reality. After trying expensive placebos with bad side effects and high hype, I tried Seroquel.  It works on the psychosis, mania and depression I've experienced in trade for being a little sleepy.  Seroquel is so far the only medication that works by itself & which I can function even after missing a dose (not recommended).  It's all about risk versus controlling symptoms with these medications.  If you've found something effective for treating the symptoms, the next step is finding the cause.

I was given Seroquel and on the FIRST NIGHT I slept and slept very well for the first time in months.  I woke up with a clear head and was not confused about who or where I was.  I did not get the zombie feeling but I was very tired all the time - taking Seroquel 4 times a day.  When my dose and frequency were reduced the sleepiness went away.
