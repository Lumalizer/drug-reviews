1,Lurasidone,Schizoaffective Disorder,8.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"July 22, 2021",3,"I have been taking latuda for 4 years now. I started on a low dose of 20mg and within a day or two my depression and delusions vanished and I felt real happiness for the first time in over a decade. I was in a hospital setting at the time and doctors increased my dose which I was not happy with because I experienced some anxiety and severe drowsiness. However I did adjust to 80mg dose. That being said I lived with the anxiety and sleepiness until I was trying for a baby and under supervision cut back to 40mg. I stayed at this dose throughout my entire pregnancy and afterwards, maintaining my wellness. 4 and a half years after first starting latuda, I take 20mg and am well without the anxiety. I believe this is an effective dose for me because I have never felt so normal.",Anonymous

4,Lurasidone,Schizoaffective Disorder,9.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"November 29, 2017",8,"I seriously love this Drug! I'm Schizo-affective. That is my only diagnosis. I've been on it for about a month now! 20 mg in the AM and I cut the next tab in Half, and take 10 mg at Bedtime! My ONLY problem is I have not been eating with it. It does take away my desire to eat. So this has been hard. With all the comments about eating 350 Calories, I will def start eating with it! I was on Haldol for about 8 Yrs. About 6 Months ago it started making me really depressed. I much prefer the Latuda. Keeps the hallucinations away. And the voices.",Sam_Adams_1981

I still hear voices unfortunately. It's also worked wonders for my mood, combined with 2 anti-depressants. Helps me sleep well. Only thing is the side effects are horrible... slight restlessness, OCD symptoms, boredom. Also, I can only take it at bed time. If I take it during the day it makes me really ill, so I have to sleep it off.",Superpowers
6,Lurasidone,Schizoaffective Disorder,9.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"October 21, 2016",4,I was on this medication in the summer of 2013 and it made me do things I'd never dream of doing without taking it and made my life really magical although I was so paranoid that there was a serial killer in my basement cause my brother left the door open one day and then at the end of August when I was really stressed from university and not being prepared for going back and had these weird feelings I got a psychotic episode and it was one of my worst but I was thinking of going back on Latuda and Epival because before I was only on Latuda and Lamictal and took forever to raise it but I'm planning to be on 160 mg this time and I think I preferred it to Zeldox too.,alligator112
7,Lurasidone,Schizoaffective Disorder,10.0,,"September 14, 2016",6,"This medication has really helped with my psychosis and mood, but only at 148mg. It doesn't take away my delusions and hallucinations completely, but lessens them to the point where I can function. Hardly any side effects compared to other anti-psychotics.",K1ttyc4t
8,Lurasidone,Schizoaffective Disorder,9.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"July 1, 2016",9,"I have been on Latuda for 3 years now. I take the max dose of 160mg.

14,Lurasidone,Schizoaffective Disorder,9.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"January 2, 2013",51,"Latuda (lurasidone):Great medicine!  I have tried Risperdal, Seroquel, Zyprexa, Trazadone, and more... and landing on Latuda was a blessing.  Between it in the evening and Lamictal in the morning, I am right as rain.  Only complaint is the nausea - but this can be avoided by drinking strong lemon water with the 350 calories you must consume along with your dose.  And avoid any foods or herbs or teas that interact with the CYP3A4 liver enzyme, to stay liver and heart healthy.  That's it!",Realizer
15,Lurasidone,Schizoaffective Disorder,9.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"October 29, 2012",41,"Latuda (lurasidone):There are a lot of nausea experiences out there with Latuda. I am trying to post my findings everywhere.  I have run a controlled experiment over the course of 4 months to see what I could do about the nausea.  Ever read the entire black label sheet that comes with the this?  I have.  It's incredibly intense.  One thing to keep in mind is what sorts of foods and drinks (and herbs) interact with the CYP3A4 enzyme that processes the medicine.  If you are eating things that do, you could be in for the spins or insomnia or worse.  Another thing is that you must eat 350 calories with Latuda.  Take the dose no earlier than 30 minutes after you eat, and you will feel much better for it.  ",Reaching for Normal

It's the best thing so far, though not perfect. Have shed some excess weight = good.Still have inadequate libido = bad.Still have some unpleasant thoughts = bad.It's better than:Risperdal, which was more of a sedative.Geodon- I didn't like the powdered capsule format. Depakote.   I feel more ""normal"" and healthy taking Latuda, and have stayed out of the hospital for over a decade.Although, I have more friends, contacts, community involvement, significant other/partner, part time job, Laughter yoga, hobbies.",billboard
18,Lurasidone,Schizoaffective Disorder,8.0,,"September 7, 2012",51,"Latuda (lurasidone):I have been on every antipsychotic you can think of, and none of them has seemed to help. Seroquel helped quiet the voices but I also gained almost 100 pounds. I have been going through this for almost 5 years, getting better then worse again, and the best so far has been Latuda. Been taking it for about three to four weeks and already the voices have quieted, I'm doing things like cleaning the house again, drawing, I'm happier, not overly hungry, and I'm actually losing weight. Kind of scared to get my hopes up since I always seem to get better, then get worse... but so far so good!",Anonymous

Before I was very angry and had hallucinations and that is minimized now. I also started taking Viibryd at the same time and was on it a month with the Latuda but the Viibryd made me extremely manic so I was taken off it. Now with just the Latuda I am very calm, still get a little angry and blow things out of proportion but otherwise it is making me feel really good. I have started journaling and reading a lot more. I have high energy and have started walking a lot more. The only thing that I noticed was when I was on both medications that I ate a lot. But with the Latuda I am great and love life.",Anonymous
20,Lurasidone,Schizoaffective Disorder,10.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"June 19, 2012",52,"Latuda (lurasidone):This medicine is a God-send. I am not overly hungry on it...in fact, I have started losing weight. I have only had a little nausea, but it just seems like my stomach is weaker (aka I get more car-sick, or more queasy when hungry). I fall asleep 2 hours after taking this, so it helps me sleep, but I don't have to pass out right away. Barely any akathesia, hardly any agitation, happiness, and energy. I have started reading, working out, eating healthy again. I'm going back to school. It doesn't dull my senses or cognition so I'm still intelligent and aware. I'm on 40 mg right now and it's enough to hold back the voices and paranoia. The only frustrating thing about it is that you have to take it with 350 calories or it absorbs less.",Anonymous

I've got better on Latuda for my schizoaffective disorder. I use Celexa and Lamictal with it, and I can finally control everything about my disorder. I got my life back on Latuda, it has given me more energy, and I can get out and do just about everything now, when before I couldn't do anything.",Anonymous
22,Lurasidone,Schizoaffective Disorder,10.0,,"April 7, 2012",50,"Latuda (lurasidone):This medicine has been amazing. I was put on 40 mg at night and we changed it to 20 mg in the morning and 20 mg at night. It makes me a bit sedated during the day, but honestly this is a relief, since I'm just really glad not to be so paranoid and afraid anymore. It's made the voices leave, paranoia go way down, and I don't fly off the handle over every little thing anymore. No weight gain, no increased appetite, and I don't feel dumb as a rock like I have on Risperdal or Geodon. Would definitely recommend this medicine to anyone who hasn't tried it but who needs a change! I've been on it for about 4 and a half weeks.",Anonymous

The nausea hits me a little bit but it's not so severe that I would stop the medication. For those who take Verapamil for migraines (etc) should be warned - my psychiatric nurse practitioner did not say there is a moderate interaction between these two medications. Verapamil potentiates Latuda, thus making Latuda stronger. I haven't had any other nasty side effects. No EPS. Good sign.",Oluwa
