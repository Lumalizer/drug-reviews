0,Valproic acid,Schizoaffective Disorder,9,,"January 20, 2021",6,"I started to take Epival 1 month ago for schizoaffective and epilepsy. So far so good although I am a quite hyper on this. But I do tend to take the reverse on some medications. It has helped drastically for insomnia, depression and severe anger issues and my seizures.  Hope everything stays good. Time will tell.",Ben

2,Valproic acid,Schizoaffective Disorder,8,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"October 21, 2016",12,I came off this because of the flat mood where I had no real feelings but I wish I hadn't cause I would've saved time cause I got a manic episode 8 months later with lamictal but I felt like I always did better and felt better on lamictal but I guess I was only on 300 mg so it made my mania worst when I wouldn't sleep enough because I was doing my work. and all semester long I felt like I was getting manic and psychotic but I guess I didn't realize it takes longer to recover from a manic episode. I'm thinking of going back on Epival and Invega or Epival and Latuda cause there's almost no options left and I hated clozapine cause it gave me seizures and broke my ankles. my main problem is I can't take my vitamins with Epival.,alligator112
3,Valproic acid,Schizoaffective Disorder,1,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"July 13, 2016",13,"I hated this medication. it gave me no mood, no feelings, not able to cry or a supposed flat mood my psychiatrist said plus it made me gain tons of weight in plus of the clozapine I used to be on that gave me seizures and made me break my ankles and it was completely useless cause I never needed it even though they thought ""nothing has ever worked for you"". I was only on it because they forced me to take clozapine and it was giving me seizures and the clozapine wasn't even good cause I didn't make any friends and I didn't really like anybody. ever since I've been on Lamictal 300 mg and Invega 12 mg I've felt more normal and I'm able to cry and feel true feelings like I used to.",alligator112
