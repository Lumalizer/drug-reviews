2,Invega,Schizoaffective Disorder,9.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"February 11, 2022",0,"I am on the injection, not sure what mg but I get it every 3 months. It's been almost a year and I have gained 40lbs. I have frequent heart burn, and my cholesterol is high. My feelings are flat so I don't overact to things as I used to. And no depression. Sometimes I have very vivid dreams and nightmares. Most days I have no motivation, but some days I have excess energy to get everything done that I need to. I haven't had a menstrual cycle since I started this medication. It has kept the mania and psychosis away though. And other than all those side affects I listed I am grateful for this medication. I was one who would miss doses or stop taking my medication altogether and have almost ruined my life several times. Even with all those side affects, I would rather be on invega than not. It has saved my life.",Anonymous

It has also been one year since I quit drinking, so that may sully the exact nature of my experience thus far.  I have been on several antipsychotics over the last 10 years but Invega stands out as more powerful and, in terms of symptom reduction, more effective.  While at times it can blur my thoughts it has definitely given me the ability to recognize when I am becoming delusional about things.  Invega does not stop me from starting down the road of psychosis it just allows me to somehow acknowledge it and stop it.   Side effects I have: constant restlessness and one time the injection itself ended up making my whole arm hurt like anything for 24 hours.",Jj

I would literally cry upon waking because I couldn't bear being conscious. I was sleeping ~13 hours a day for a few months. It made me catatonic a few times as well. I was so depressed there were times I couldn't lift my head or stand up or even talk. It was an actual nightmare and my psych insisted it was just initial adjustment side effects, but I have never been on a medication that harmed me as much as Invega. I would have taken the psychosis over the Invega any day. I stopped taking it without permission and I kid you not--the next day, I felt normal. I physically couldn't get out of bed and my limbs felt like lead; it was ridiculous.

It took away the voices and delusions.  The only problem I have with this drug is the weight gain and sensitivity to cold and heat. I gained 60 pounds in 6 months...its really hurt my self esteem and I'm going to stop taking it next month. Another thing after the voices stopped I had visuals and voices late at night and early morning that would wear off 3 months into taking it. My mood also seems a little more irritable but not too bad and I'm think I'm starting to have anhedonia, which at first was a giant relief after being so charged and emotionally torn apart with voices but now I'm starting to feel like it's not the best option.

I had the initial dose of 256mg I believe, then 150mg for four months. My last shot was in aug 2018. By the second shot my thoughts had stopped. I could no longer think. It shut off my consciousness. My memory and retaining information has been effected. I developed anhedonia. I can no longer feel any emotion. I have no libido or menstrual cycles. I haven't had an appetite in 4 months. I have no desire to eat or get pleasure from it. I have insomnia. I believe this medicine has caused brain damage.

I will say one thing - if you going to take this be careful there some sucky side affects like weight gain. I didn't get the weight gain  but I did get low libido and it got a little better once I stopped taking it completely and went back on. I still have some high blood pressure, high white blood cell count and high cholesterol so watch that. So that's all my side affects. One more thing don't let these punks mess you around - once you're on it they might try making your life a drug induced nightmare. It's your body, you're choice if it works you will know. If you're really bad stick to a low dose and test if its the  right drug for you. Then you're not going to get one: addicted and two: not aware of if its the right drug for you.

Granted, there is that yucky weight gain--but with Invega I actually have the energy to go to the gym 4.5 hours a week so it's (s-l-o-w-l-y) coming off. I can read and write, manage a routine, etc. Granted, there are some times when I get a little muddled, but it's now in the range of ""take a deep breath and start again"" as opposed to catastrophic.

I am in pain from bad knees & can hardly walk, now....Great mood helper but terrible on the body!",Michael T

The only positive is that it did snap me back into reality, but some clean time would have done that.  I have gained weight all in my stomach, I developed akathisia that lasted 2 months after discontinuing.  Also extreme anhedonia which can persist for up to a year.  I hope I return to normal way before that.  Please only attempt this med if you don't know which way is up.",copperdome

52,Invega,Schizoaffective Disorder,7.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"September 5, 2016",22,this medication is weird. you can be doing really well and be normal and then all of a sudden you get a manic episode or psychotic episode out of nowhere when you were normal like 2 days ago.  It doesn't help you sleep although it's good because it didn't stop me from waking up in the morning. I was able to go to for my morning class as I was waking up at 5:30am. Although  couldn't concentrate in class and I never cooked. from what I remember I was doing better on risperdal although I was more out of it and way more paranoid and it was really scary but I had good friends and never got manic and never had to go to the hospital for almost 10 years and also did well in school. I think invega is too inconsistent and can't take the mood stabilizer I want to,alligator112
53,Invega,Schizoaffective Disorder,8.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"May 6, 2016",33,I think this is the only antipsychotic that has worked for me. I was on risperdal previously and it didn't work that well except that I made good friends and was nice usually but I was always really paranoid or psychotic when I'd do all nighters for school and thought there was a serial killer outside the window. invega is much better though and I don't get that paranoia anymore or the really scary type of paranoia anymore although I get scared sometimes but it doesn't stop me from doing things. I'm on 12 mg of invega and 300 mg of lamictal. Im not doing the best because the lamictal should be at 400 mg to be optimal. I wasn't able to tolerate too high of a dose of invega at first because it made me really tired& sleep all day but I can now,alligator112

I also was diagnosed with Aspergers. I took a personality and general mental health test by a professional psychologist and the results were tallied by a computer. I have schizoaffective disorder.I showed my results to my psychiatrist and she's prescribed invega.

Now college grad, off disability, full time job (40 k) at investment bank all possible by Invega. I was severely sick and now I haven't been for 5 years. It took a couple of hospitalizations, several lost jobs, and even jail ( which was turning point) to find Invega. I did 3 full time  yrs in college and got 3.9 in finance.Only sides effects I've had are slightly high cholesterol and weight gain which for me is somewhat manageable with diet although for what I eat I'd be 20 pds less.

Weening off of it was not hard but I was also taking large doses of niacin and lithium at the time. I had a manic episode that lasted 3 months after withdrawing. After that, one injection brought me back to reality in less than a day. I have extreme weight gain on invega, drousiness (sleep 12 hours a day) and decreased sex drive. Though it is important for me to point out, like I said, no mania or hallucinating. I function well on the injection. It is the side effects that I have troubles dealing with.",Damien Guymon

I went from being unable to drive, cook or take care of myself to being able to live a normal life. I work, function normally socially, drive and pretty much do whatever I want. I didn't notice that the Invega helped much with the depression. I take Effexor for that, and it is great. I spend most of my time being content now, which is wonderful. My biggest complaint about the Invega is that it does nothing to stop the hallucinations. The only side effects I had were blurred vision and orthostatic hypotension (dizziness upon standing). Both went away after 7-10 days. I have to say that the withdrawal symptoms are unpleasant (dizziness, seizures, jitteriness.)",Anonymous

Initially, I had severe emotional swings and delusions created by the voices and my interaction with them. I began taking Invega 18 months ago - this was very successful in moderating the emotions and generally calming my mental state. In terms of side effects: I am really struggling to lose any weight even with good diet and exercise, I have very high prolactin levels - this contributes to me not getting periods, having occasional breast discharge and I believe is responsible for 'anorgasmia' - where I have very low sexual desire and arousal and feelings of orgasm are very subdued.
