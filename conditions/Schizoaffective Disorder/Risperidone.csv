0,Risperidone,Schizoaffective Disorder,9,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"July 29, 2021",2,"Risperdal (risperidone):This is the only anti psychotic that did not cause me to gain weight. It's also the only antipsychotic I didn't 'feel' (tired, apathetic, no emotions) when I took it. When I was put on doses too high for me I felt it, but not as strongly as other antipsychotics I've been on in the past. I keep my normal eating habits on this and a normal weight and really go about my day not thinking of it. I feel like my normal self on this and I'm not going to try other antipsychotics because this works for me. Weight gain and apathy were my biggest issues with other antipsychotics in the past and risperdal is the only one I've tried that does not cause these side affects in me.",Jennana
1,Risperidone,Schizoaffective Disorder,1,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"May 26, 2021",2,"First of all I would say  we are real people facing the side effects of this awful drug they call Risperdone. There are some people with positive comments and as an earlier stated review mentioned when  it works it works brilliantly yes in a rare occurrence it works.  But most of the time it has lifelong side effects, this is coming from as someone who has taken  the drug for a few years so I can weigh in literally on this topic.  I'm a 100 pounds heavier and not to mention  hair loss and loss of a grip on reality. It may stop the so called patients ""hallucinations"" at what cost? In my case they couldn't pin a full diagnosis on me so gave me a cauldron brew of meds on top of this. It might help a little but at the cost of the body your price is too high. Side note what are they worried about me thinking or experiencing....",Jodeep

They gave me a resperidone injection and I passed out for the night. I was in a bit of a brain fog for  a week or so but eventually recovered while taking resperidone daily. My positive symptoms all subsided besides a faint voice every once in awhile like someone's talking on the radio when it's really quiet. Makes me really tired during the day and working is hard though. Glad I found something to keep me out of psychosis. I take 4 MG daily with no negative side effects,Kklc

First off, risperidone made me feel less paranoid when driving and when being around people. I enjoyed that part as nothing else has worked for me in the area of paranoia yet. The awful side of it was nightly nightmares. And I don't usually get dreams or nightmares. But these were frightening and affected my mood for a while after awaking. The nightmares were absolutely frightening and I didn't look forward to sleeping at all. I changed to Geodon lately and we'll have to see where that leads me. have a great day.",sportay

Now they took away the depot and replaced it with tablets and put me on flupenthixol depot and kept the escitolapram. So I’m still on it now.It caused weight gain (olanzapine level weight gain, which is partly why they the depot injection wasn’t worth it), gynecomastia (enlarged breasts) and ejaculatory dysfunction (I can still have sex just fine, it’s just that I don’t always ejaculate- the orgasm is the same) which is ok, since my sex drive dropped with the disease (I’m the depressive type).I don’t agree that it clouds your mind; severe mental illnesses come with cognitive impairments (such as disorganized thinking, tangential thoughts and mangled speech.",Rollingstone

I have also experienced a loss of appetite and have lost some weight (I am overweight so this is good). So yeah, losing weight, still have libido and much better sleep.

On the positive side my auditory and visual hallucinations completely went away immediately which enabled me to make it to therapy more frequently and sleep more often and slowly over years build up a healthy and stabilizing lifestyle.
