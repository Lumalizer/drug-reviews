I coped well on Aripiprazole or Abilify *initially* along with an antidepressant, but the benefits soon stopped.I’m now back to square 1 - paranoid, delusional and horribly depressed and anxious.

Good drug, much more motivation and definitely more of my old personality.  No weight gain or anything.  Worked well for symptoms on 10mg.  I couldn’t stay on it though because I had really bad akasthia and couldn’t sleep.  I would wake up every hour and be up for the day at 5am.  You can only do that for so long until you’re too tired to function.  Also it mad me super hot and sweaty.  Would have stayed on it though if it wasn’t for the sleep problems.",Wesley

It has helped me with my problems, including psychotic thoughts, and disorganized thinking, as well as aggressive behavioral tendencies. For those feeling as if it has impaired their abilities, I don't feel as if it has done so for me. That was an initial concern of mine, for taking medication. But Abilify has only enhanced my concentration.The only reason I give this score an 8/10 is because there is always more that can be done, it isn't a miracle cure.

6,Aripiprazole,Schizoaffective Disorder,3.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"October 29, 2021",2,"Abilify (aripiprazole):Garbage, switched from invega to abilify. Major side effects even with 5mg are fatigue, stiff muscles , restlessness, horrible insomnia, akathesia with higher dosages. What is good about it is that it doesn't induce sexual dysfunction like other AP drugs and it lowers prolactin which is a plus. Seems to enhance the anhedonia caused by the Invega in a bad way. The Half life is pretty long about 3 or 4 days it can overload your system if you are a poor metabolizer. Seems to lift depression but also seems to induce waves of depression, the drug itself is pretty schizo in that regard. The drug itself isn't that bad but it's metabolite got a lot of negative effects. All anti-psychotics are crap in general but as long it print dollars they will keep getting prescribed. don't go above 5 mg unless you want akathesia. Disregard comments about it being weight neutral, you will gain weight nevertheless. it's just overall less worse than other AP regarding weight.",doug

It helped balance me out when I really needed it but after a couple months goes downhill.  It's very sad and I'm fighting to get off it and stay off all meds, I'll fight my mental battle without these numbing meds.  I want to find that zest of life again.

It's been six years since I have taken it and still have some effects. Thought process has changed dramatically since the episode and lost the ability to think and problem solve. I have lost most short term memory as well as some longterm. My once creative side before taking (musically, art) is now completely gone. Many tests later doctors still cannot find what the problem is, no evidence of brain damage but they do believe something was altered in my brain.

I have WAY too much energy and have found I’ve become a bit impulsive. Although, any hallucinations I used to have, have lessened quite a bit so that’s a plus! I feel like the longer you’re on it, the less bad side effects you feel. If you’re feeling too energized and like the constantly need to move, it may be a thing called Akathisia; a need to always be doing something or a mental unrest. Any anger I used to have, has lessened or is gone pretty much. I do feel pretty spaced out a lot and very forgetful thought and not myself but at least the psychotic symptoms I had have lessened.",Paprika

Over the years, that was the story being told. No other medication before it did anything for me, so it seemed to be safe for me to stay on Abilify. I finally experimented with taking less after I realized I seemed different than other people. I was wondering why I could never remember things very well and was not very confident or comfortable. It has been a year tapering off from 15 mg daily and I am finally almost completely off.  I have improved tremendously and for the first time in 15 years feel like myself.   I did not realize how much this medication was making me dumb.  Life is too important to mess up. As always, listen and trust your own intuition first.

I had a period in my life where I was into the occult, the bible, and other occult subjects, and my doctor saw that as being unacceptable. So they put me on invega and that made me extremely depressed and was crying most of the day, so I switched to abilify.  The abilify makes me anxious,  restless, body aches and joint pain, lost my self worth and purpose. I've been a musician for 13 years and I just sit here now unable to motivate myself to do anything. I miss how I felt off of meds, but I'm forced to take them. I don't think antipsychotics are good for depression at all. Every time I get my shot I almost immediately fall into a deep depression for 2 weeks or so, and then start feeling better the last 2 weeks of the month, then I get my shot and start the cycle all over again, I want to get rid of my meds and I want to talk to God again.",Jesus lol

He just lowered my dose and put me back on pills. He increased my Cymbalta to 60 mg. Hopefully this will help with the dizziness, drowsiness and depression. Overall it helped when I needed it. It makes me sleep too much - 12 hrs a night plus naps, very tired. I want off it but since my doctor won't change it and I don't want to get my depression back so I can't stop it.",Laura

33,Aripiprazole,Schizoaffective Disorder,7.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"September 18, 2019",5,I've been on aripiprazole for about three months now - the first two were amazing.  I was getting loads done at home - despite feeling previously that I struggled because of something like mild dyspraxia on top of my mental health condition.  Then my OCD started creeping in and then I stopped sleeping as much.  I spoke to my psychiatrist and she recommended taking the meds an hour before tea (evening meal)- my sleep improved but my OCD got really really bad and my appetite went - so I reduced the meds myself from 15 to 11.25 - now I feel okay again - I am discussing this with my psychiatrist tomorrow. If I could have spoken to her sooner I would have done.  I wish there was a medication that made you more outgoing though as I'm still a bit scared of public transport at the moment.  I'm in the UK so don't know if I'm allowed to review - but thought it might be useful to people.,HMAC
