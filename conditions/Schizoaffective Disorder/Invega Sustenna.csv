0,Invega Sustenna,Schizoaffective Disorder,1.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"March 25, 2022",0,"Yeah it controlled my hallucinations, but at what cost? This drug should not be prescribed to anyone, especially young males. Literal chemical castration. Invega robbed me of my erections, sex drive, and sperm. When I ejaculate nothing comes out. High prolactin and low T levels. My memory is awful, no pleasure in doing anything at all. Restlessness, brain fog, no thoughts or emotions. This injection will leave you bed ridden. Literally all I do is lay down and hope for the day to pass by fast nowadays. My depression got a lot worse on this drug. Stay far away.",InvegaShitstena
1,Invega Sustenna,Schizoaffective Disorder,1.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"November 24, 2021",5,"I took invega sustenna for a year and a half. I was forced on it by my old mental hospital, and the family member I was living with, told me, I had to stay on Invega to live with this person. I got a 234mg shot once a month, for a year and a half. This drug completely ruined my life. It is absolute garbage for anyone's body. I went from 170 pounds to 300 pounds within this time frame (this is literally the most weight I had ever gained in my entire LIFE.) It turned me into a complete couch potato, made me so lazy and tired that I had to drink at least 3 cups of coffee a day to counter this problem, it completely destroyed my motivation for doing ANYTHING throughout my day. I sat around eating junk food, but also healthy food. Regardless of what I ate, I would gain 10 pounds every single month. I am really tired of the USA and it's doctors promoting these awful ""medications"" to sick people as if they are good options. There was zero benefit to using Invega, do NOT take this drug.",Coqonutz
2,Invega Sustenna,Schizoaffective Disorder,1.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"October 27, 2021",12,"Destroyed my life beyond belief.  Found out it can take up to a year or even longer to leave the body.  Close to 40 year old and now live in my parents house because I'm unable to work or do other activities. Absolutely horrible experience. I'm on CTO but got switched to Abilify, when I tried to explain how Invega was so bad for me the nurses and psych blamed my symptoms instead of this horrible med. Was bed bound for a full month and thought I was going die unable to breath. It destroys your soul, body and your social life. Invega sustenna probably means ''sustain the vegetable'' that's what it turns you into for up to a year or longer. IT SHOULD BE BANNED",Doug
3,Invega Sustenna,Schizoaffective Disorder,1.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"October 12, 2021",4,"Wow where do I even begin with this horrible drug. About 3 days after I received my injection, I started to experience severe restlessness.I couldn’t sit still and had to constantly move. My sperm was gone. I was literally counting every hour, praying so that the drugs half life wears out (which is 1 month so you can imagine how torturous that was).I couldn’t think straight I was only focused on counting the hours. I had no pleasure in doing anything. I literally got turned into a vegetable that you see in movies about psychiatric patients. PLEASE,only try this drug AFTER you tried other antipsychotics that proved to not work. Stay healthy",BlessYourSoul

I wasn’t responding to the oral medications and I have compliance issues with taking oral meds anyway.  Like most people who have already commented, my experience with this drug have been horrible.  Yes, it stopped the hallucinations but it has robbed me of my emotions, I feel flat all the time, I gained weight, my hair fell out, I lost my sex drive and my ability to orgasm, I have anhedonia and avolition, I cannot socialize anymore, I can barely contribute to a conversation, I’m barely caring for myself (not cooking, not cleaning)....I am like a child.

Yes the side effects are terrible, you cycle from being overly manic to super lethargic (I held down a job for 3 years as a line cook on 256 mg dose) your appetite is uncontrollable at times and exercise is overly strenuous and difficult (I tried a regiment of weight lifting and killer ten mile runs daily to keep the weight off, your body can’t shed breast tissue when your a male) Since the circumstance of me taking this medication is mandatory in all aspects of my life for somebody in a similar situation to me 8 years ago (I’ll spare the details) I would recommend this medication for bi-polar Or schizophrenia.",Turtle

20,Invega Sustenna,Schizoaffective Disorder,8.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"November 20, 2019",26,"I was placed on invega Sustenna after having a violent psychotic episode. I attempted suicide in a very violent manner and went back to the psych ward after surgery. They placed me on 156mg injection once a month. Since being on the injection I’ve experienced slight weight gain, loss of euphoria I used to get from using drugs like alcohol, weed, amphetamines, benzodiazepines, and also the inability to trip from using psychedelics. Also, loss of sex drive. Most importantly though...I no longer have the constant thoughts of wanting to end my life or hurt others. All things said though, I have decided to remain on invega injections, sacrificing all the wonderful highs I used to get from dope because I’m afraid that if I stop taking invega I might have another psychotic break, and that the BEAST inside me could drive me to commit violence on myself or others. If invega makes me non-violent, non-sexual, docile, and stable then I say it is a good drug.",Dirty D

They used psychological manipulation to get me to ""agree."" Six months later I'm 60 lbs overweight, depressed, and tired beyond belief. All I want to do is lay down and close my eyes. Today I woke up about 11:00 am, got out of bed for an hour, went and laid back down till about 4 pm, then got up to make myself something to eat, then laid down till 6, got up for another hour then right back to bed. This is my daily routine on this nightmarish drug. I'm taking one class in school and can't afford to withdraw off of it right now, but in a month I will graduate and finally get off this terrible drug forever.

I have no passion for anything, no emotion, no ideas or input or anything to say to anyone, and my energy for life overall is just flat. So flat. I constantly feel like I only do things to appease people and appear like a normal person. Only the people closest to me, like my family, recognize that I'm no longer the person I used to be. I have hopes that I'll be able to stop this medication someday... and that when I stop, I'll be able to recollect whatever is left of who I used to be. I don't know if I'd recommend this medication.

I think it has good and bad effects to it. It helps me control myself better. I don't blurt out random nonsense anymore like I used to. I don't like the fact it causes sexual dysfunction and weight gain. I've been taking topiramate for awhile now and I barely eat anything but my psychiatrist blames my weight gain all on me even though weight gain clearly is one of the side effects of invega as well as other antipsychotics. I noticed I haven't ejaculated as much semen the last few times I came and I think the invega is to blame. If it wasn't for the sexual dysfunction and weight problems and also the decreased testosterone due to increased prolactin I'd say this medicine is not that bad but because I'm forced to take it I might as well just suck it up and live with it and accept what I have to live with.,Anonymous

If you exercise and eat intelligently I am sure there would be no weight gain, but do be warned: you will be much more hungry than usual.  Overall its the best anti-psychotic I've tried though, and that includes Risperdal, Abilify and Haliperidol (the worst one by far.)

48,Invega Sustenna,Schizoaffective Disorder,3.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"February 17, 2018",9,"Cons: Invega increased my ""PROLACTIN hormone"" 5 times more than the maximum level. Thus, I lost my menstrual cycle for more than one year, sexual dysfunction, depression, sleep disturbances, etc...  This drug also lowered my metabolism. As a result, I experienced food coma (falling deep sleep) after eating food. It also increased my blood sugar. I gained 20 kg in 8 months. Tremor was another side effect of invega.  I was on 100 mg injection. BUT, I had no delusion with it !",Eli F

Zero libido, dizzy spells, acne, plus 50 pounds weight gain. I lowered my injection 3 times to now 39 mgs, the lowest dose.  Less acne, still fat, still zero libido but, less dizzy. The benefit was that I have zero delusions.",DanaAnastasia
50,Invega Sustenna,Schizoaffective Disorder,,,"January 30, 2018",26,"This is the worst possible nightmare of a drug.  I was injected with one 234 mg dose and never took the 2nd shot or 156 mg because I felt so horrible.  I was so miserable I wanted to die.  I had no emotion, no imagination, no memory, and no initiative.  I disappeared into a dark hole for months. It took 6 months before I started to feel any better.  It took about 2 1/2 years before I felt like I was anywhere near back to normal.  Don't let anyone inject you with this poison.  You will regret it.",day2play
