0,Lithium,Schizoaffective Disorder,2,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"November 29, 2019",5,I had psychotic symptoms and rapidly fluctuating symptoms despite taking Lithium. Lithium also caused me to wake up in the middle of every night to pee and to not be able to hold pee for long. 1800 mg (900 Extended Release twice a day) got my lithium blood level to 0.9 which was recommended for anti-manic effect.,John
1,Lithium,Schizoaffective Disorder,10,,"September 27, 2018",13,Great experience with 150mg of lithium. Worked to completely stabilize me. I'm so relieved. Wish I had tried it sooner. The other psych meds didn't work for my schizoaffective bipolar.,Sara
2,Lithium,Schizoaffective Disorder,8,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"December 12, 2017",16,"Lithium has finally pulled me out of a constant rapid cycling mixed state, which consisted of depression, paranoia, psychosis, agitation and extreme anxiety. I occasionally feel poorly in hot environments, nausea and dizziness. I think I get some fluid retention in the heat I didn't get prior to lithium. I was very unwell before starting this drug, and it has made me feel a lot better mentally, more stable and calmed down.",cobweb
