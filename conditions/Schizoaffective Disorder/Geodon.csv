0,Geodon,Schizoaffective Disorder,9.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"February 7, 2022",3,"Surprised that I like this medicine. I went on it for the weight neutral benefit, and have been on it for almost 7 months before. No akathisia at all like I had on the Vraylar, which is a plus. I maintained the same weight for 5 months but just realized that I went up 2 pounds despite eating small portions, working out 5 days a week, and taking an appetite suppressant supplement. Overall pleased with the drug though because when I was on Vraylar I gained 30 lbs in a year and had terrible akathisia. Helps me sleep at night, too. The only cons are that I got terrible facial edema on it (face swelling) compared to other antipsychotics I've been on, so my face looks much bigger; also you have to take it with food so I can't drive after I take it because it makes me too groggy to drive. Staying on it though until better drugs like Ulotaront come out, because of how I didn't gain as much weight on it and because Geodon is not supposed to raise your cholesterol either.",nicann87

Unfortunately, over time, it did not work for hearing voices. I am in the middle of detoxing off this drug - word of warning!

It took a while to get past the sleepy side effects, and those were not trivial either.  After about three weeks, or so, I was able to get adjusted to the medication (120 mg / day) and I can enjoy the benefits of clear thought and presence in reality.  I never realized how much of my illness left me feeling disconnected from life and others. Now I feel grounded and I like life again. No weight gain that I have noticed, and once I got used to the medication, the sleepiness was very manageable.",CJ
7,Geodon,Schizoaffective Disorder,9.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"January 24, 2020",24,I'm schizoaffective and was put on Geodon 2 weeks ago for visual and auditory hallucinations. I had been taking Seroquel and it wasn't working for me so the doctor switched me over to the Geodon. Within a day the visuals had receded and shortly after the auditory as well. I've suffered for over a decade with trying different medications and so far this one has worked the best for me and my body chemistry.  I also have major depression so the stimulant properties are a perfect solution for my lethargy.,Michi
8,Geodon,Schizoaffective Disorder,1.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"October 12, 2019",26,"Geodon in the beginning sounded like a good idea but it turns out that I was very wrong. After the first day of taking it I developed insomnia, heart palpitations and could not feel any emotions what so ever. These symptoms persisted for the whole time I took Geodon and on top of that, Geodon did nothing to help my psychosis. I then asked my doctor to get me off of Geodon and that is when the real kicker shows. Geodon has horrible withdrawal symptoms that hit despite how slowly I decreased my dose. These withdrawal symptoms for me included really bad insomnia, which made it impossible to go to bed at all and caused hallucinations, flu like symptoms and more heart palpitations. I am currently in week 1 out of 12 of getting off my 120mg dose. So basically if you take this drug, you WILL be hooked on it. Good luck.",Czr

10,Geodon,Schizoaffective Disorder,4.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"September 26, 2019",6,I have been on Geodon/Ziprasidone for about a year. My doctor convinces me it fights my symptoms but all I experience is that 30 mins after taking it I go into depression after the depression wears off I then get sleepy and I sleep. Other drugs  that I have take don't fight my mania symptom  and I stay awake for days. The only advantage of Geodon  is I sleep  but not after 40 minutes of depression. A small price to pay sleep. But Surprisingly I wake up like a new man,kyle

13,Geodon,Schizoaffective Disorder,5.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"June 3, 2019",24,"This drug Geodon was amazing, I've felt the best I have ever felt MENTALLY in 12 years. I was literally crying of happiness because I didn't think I could ever feel normal again, it was that good. But unfortunately I got HORRIBLE akithesia (intense restlessness) and tapping of my foot that caused me to stop the drug. The foot tapping took 2 weeks to go away. I also would get watery diarrhea and episodes of overheating where I thought I had a fever but my temperature was normal. Also would get intense dizziness if I took my dose late, and felt like I had to drop dead of sleep no matter where I was, as soon as I took my dose.

The only medication that ever stopped my hallucinations before this was haldol, but it caused extreme akinesia, so I stopped taking it.

The hallucinations have almost completely gone, and my mood is stable for the first time in years. No severe weight gain or weight loss.

The side effect that troubles me is Low Platlettes. I was diagnosed with that shortly after starting it but my doctors don't blame the Geodon.  Has anyone ever stopped taking it after prolonged use.

The first month I would get blurry vision, shaky hands, loss of appetite, large pupils later in the evening. The blurry vision has gone away. I have very little akathisia.

I never used to get crazy laughing before I don't think but I don't know if it's also because I was in a mental hospital with tons of crazy people and picked up their behaviour. my looks got completely ruined by this medication forever.

However my the end of the first week I was severely delusional, to the point where I didn't even notice it. At the end of week 2 I didn't even know who I was, I thought I was turning into animals and I had no perception of time. A good way to explain it was the worst week long trip ever.

The Geodon helped but only barely scratched the surface. They added Abilify to the mix and I was so unbelievably tired that I couldn't even walk a straight line, so they took me off the Abilify.

34,Geodon,Schizoaffective Disorder,8.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"April 9, 2015",22,"I have kind of mixed feelings about Geodon.  I have only been taking it for a few weeks.  It has eliminated my psychotic features...nearly 100%.  The side effects are hard for me but I have read that people get more used to it over time so I am not ready to give up on it yet.  The side effects I experience are sleepiness, which is a problem at work, but not nearly as bad as Seroquel was.  The other side effect that is hard for me is the shakiness it gives me.  I have to take Artane, which is a drug for Parkinson's disease, but that does calm down the shakiness.  Other than that, my appetite is normal, my moods are calmed down (but I also take Lamictal for that).  As far as Geodon's effect on the psychotic features goes, it's amazing.",UT GUY
