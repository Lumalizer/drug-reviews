0,Olanzapine,Schizoaffective Disorder,8.0,Taken for 5 to 10 years,"March 4, 2022",0,"Works well to dampen ruminations and come to a realization that I am more than just my thoughts. I feel like I have more conscious control over my brain in the day and 10mg is a great sleeping pill to brag about (others like dramamine have tolerance dependencies). Quite interesting dreams in general. I have gained and lost weight both, keto with a 12-1500 calorie target worked well at one point in conjunction with the metabolic pathways that olanzapine invokes, but still trying to lose weight on a vegan diet (Splendid Spoon baseline), mostly due to occasional extra binging. No hospitalizations since beginning, and only one instance of dizziness. I have concerns about longterm metabolic syndrome and dependency as a thienobenzodiazepine but no harm I know of so far in the past 5 years.",2snakes
1,Olanzapine,Schizoaffective Disorder,10.0,Taken for 5 to 10 years,"February 15, 2022",0,"I was on abilify (10mg) on it's own. I was having sleep problems at night but I managed to get my hands on olanzapine (10mg). It worked instantly, and overtime, now that I reflect, it gives you the ability to block out the voices and function throughout the day, at least for me. It gives me the ability to function, be happy, and live a life with schizoaffective without the voices/symptoms really being in the way. Of course, olanzapine made me gain weight. About 20lbs, but the advantages other than the weight gain are great. For my personal experience, it saved my life when I really needed it and gave me the ability to just block all the schizoaffective symptoms away. Really helped productivity, and function. I would recommend this pill with Abilify.I'm on 10mg Abilify and 10mg Olanzapine, with it, I achieved Dean's honor roll in college. Of course, everybody is different, but just for me, that's my experience.",KarmicMythz

I previously suffered from delusions such as believing I had super powers (I could see and hear ghosts!) and impulsive thoughts that were hard to ignore (such as turning the wheel of the car into oncoming traffic). Luckily, olanzapine solved these issues. However, I suffer some of the side effects. I gained 40 pounds, which no amount of dieting or exercising could fix, gained a sharp increase in appetite, I always suffer from a dry mouth, and I always feel low energy, though that could be from sleeping 12 hours a day due to depression.

So definitely don't discount this drug due to weight gain...it's different for everybody. It does cause daytime sedation, but after being hospitalized 12 times, I gave up on trying to stay slim or going back to work one day, and ""gave in"" to the olanzapine...it was always the one drug I wanted to reach for when in any uncomfortable state of mind, and that told me that it was the drug for me.

I have tried so many medications for my Schizoaffective Disorder (Bipolar Type) and some of them have worked somewhat or I have had to many side effects to the point I could not tolerate it. The only side effect I have got from the Olanzapine is drowsiness which isn’t a problem for me because I take it a few hours before bed time. Before this medication I would hallucinate a few times a week and would sometimes go into full blown psychosis and have to be hospitalized. Now that I have been taking this medicine for a few months I have only hallucinated once but my psychiatrist increased the dosage and most of my symptoms have gone away. I would definitely recommend this medication but just make sure you exercise a few days a week. My psychiatrist told me about the possibility of weight gain but so far that hasn’t happened.,TyAustin

51,Olanzapine,Schizoaffective Disorder,8.0,,"December 5, 2012",21,Zyprexa (olanzapine):Doing wonders for me. Only problem I find is it makes my mouth extremely dry. I take it 3 times a day and I am fine all day. It doesn't make me too sleepy and I am still able to go to sleep at night with no problem.,Anonymous
52,Olanzapine,Schizoaffective Disorder,8.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"May 24, 2012",27,"Zyprexa (olanzapine):Very good so far. Not nearly as sedating as Seroquel. Maybe a little more hungry, but also much more active, cycling, long walks etc., which is good.",Anonymous
53,Olanzapine,Schizoaffective Disorder,9.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"May 5, 2012",35,"Zyprexa (olanzapine):I've been taking Zyprexa for 3 years, and it completely eliminates symptoms such as delusions, irrational thoughts, manic behavior associated with schizoaffective disorder. Biggest downside is high blood glucose levels (hyperglycemia), high lipid levels (hyperlipidemia) and weight gain of 80 lbs (from 180 lbs to 260 lbs in 3 years). ",Anonymous
54,Olanzapine,Schizoaffective Disorder,6.0,,"March 19, 2012",19,"Zyprexa (olanzapine):This is one of three new drugs I was put on recently: Zyprexa as a ""take when needed"" at the hospital along with Remeron ""as a sleep aid"" and Risperdal ""for psychotic moments"". I was kept on Tegretol and Vistaril also. I have gained 15 pounds in two weeks. I am not sure if it's the Zyprexa or the other two newbies (I know that they also cause weight gain). I do feel better but not good yet. The effect of having constant munchie-madness is annoying, as I know I am not really hungry but cannot stop. I do have eating disorders and this is dangerous. It's bad enough to have to work on all these personality and mood issues, but now I have to monitor my food like I used to when I was fat.",PillsRgood

57,Olanzapine,Schizoaffective Disorder,1.0,,"December 5, 2011",20,Zyprexa (olanzapine):This medicine makes you retain body fluid. I was on it for two years and reached a body weight of 125 kilograms in that time. It was not until I was prescribed a different antipsychotic that I began to lose weight again.,jestarfari

Plus I know that when stressed I have a hard time sleeping but I will sleep 1 hour after taking the pill.  I've had about everything in 22 years, and if the weight doesn't get you its a great medication if it works.  Maybe they will find one that works for every psychotic with this break through.",BorisIII
62,Olanzapine,Schizoaffective Disorder,1.0,,"August 2, 2010",17,"Zyprexa (olanzapine):This medicine made me gain about 15-20 lbs when I was staying at the hospital when I was 13. I'm now 22. I started taking Geodon a few weeks ago and I'm feeling much better. No more paranoia in the night at all anymore. No thoughts that there's a serial killer watching me or a serial killer in a room in my house or on a chair in the room I'm in. I'm on Risperdal, I'm trying to get off of it completely because it also made me gain a lot of weight also. I'm 166 right now and 5'8'. I used to always be slim and have no hunger. I'm also on Paxil which hasn't helped me with my depression at all, just a terrible medicine and I'm on Lamictal which has helped keep stable - I have the manic type.",Anonymous

It worked so well I have gone off all my other medicines and I got off disability, finished school, and got a full time job. I have very few side effects- mostly I sleep a lot: 10-12 hours.

I noticed the munchies on regular Zyprexa tabs but none on Zyprexa Zydis....I have actually lost weight. I gave it a rating of 8 because I still have symptoms of schizoaffective disorder but high enough rating to give it kudos compared to other drugs.,Anonymous
