0,Risperdal,Schizoaffective Disorder,9,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"July 29, 2021",2,"This is the only anti psychotic that did not cause me to gain weight. It's also the only antipsychotic I didn't 'feel' (tired, apathetic, no emotions) when I took it. When I was put on doses too high for me I felt it, but not as strongly as other antipsychotics I've been on in the past. I keep my normal eating habits on this and a normal weight and really go about my day not thinking of it. I feel like my normal self on this and I'm not going to try other antipsychotics because this works for me. Weight gain and apathy were my biggest issues with other antipsychotics in the past and risperdal is the only one I've tried that does not cause these side affects in me.",Jennana
1,Risperdal,Schizoaffective Disorder,4,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"January 13, 2021",2,"Prescribed 4mg daily after auditory hallucinations.  Works well for that, but has caused a notable increase in anxiety, complete loss of appetite and sex drive.  Looking to come off this and try a new med.",Desmondini
2,Risperdal,Schizoaffective Disorder,10,Taken for 10 years or more,"September 9, 2020",11,"I take 6 mg of Risperdal at night for Schizoaffective Disorder,  However, my mania was getting out of control during the next day; my thinking was very accelerated and euphoric.  So I decided to split the dose 3mg/night, and 3mg/day.I got much better results.  My manic episodes were stopped on their tracks.",Diesel
3,Risperdal,Schizoaffective Disorder,1,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"December 28, 2019",21,"Hello this drug is very bad and not helpful. Still hallucinated on it. Blurry vision, restlessness, does not make you tired, brain pain?!, motor control malfunctioning, difficulty thinking on it, lack of emotion on it. Please don't take this ""medicine"". Very bad. Does not work.",PoopyRisperdalPills
4,Risperdal,Schizoaffective Disorder,1,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"December 6, 2019",9,This med did not work for me. Did not help my thinking. Still felt depressed. Psychosis was still there. I was on it with other drugs too so that is probably why it didn't work. Also bad side effects too.,Sean
5,Risperdal,Schizoaffective Disorder,1,Taken for less than 1 month,"March 13, 2019",13,Took two milligrams for one day. Nausea for several days. I actually broke down and cried for hours because it was the closest to torture I had been. I didn't really need it anyway.,BazingaXDDDDDLAMO
6,Risperdal,Schizoaffective Disorder,1,,"October 15, 2018",24,"Absolutely horrible drug! I had worsened serious depression and severe akathisia from it. Agitation, irritability anxiety, aggression also came into play. I have tried many antipsychotics on the market and this one is by far the worst (Now on Quitepine and Abilify - much better!). No redeeming qualities whatsoever.",Metalstorm
7,Risperdal,Schizoaffective Disorder,10,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"December 15, 2017",24,"I've been on this for three years and love it. No delusions, no paranoia. Side effects are non existent for me. No weight gain. I'm never tired. I sleep 6-7 hours of sleep each night and feel fine. Since being on Risperdone I've run two half marathons, work 40 hours per week and haven't had symptoms in over a year.",8BitHero
8,Risperdal,Schizoaffective Disorder,4,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"July 4, 2016",11,"I have been on this medication longer than any other medication I have ever been on. Its been four and a half years, mostly on and I feel like this medication let me sleep better than all other medications I had been on until Saphris. I gained weight, but not too much about 25 pounds over the course of four and half years. I am a man, and I have noticed enlargement of the breasts development of female breast tissue. I'm coming off Risperidone now and I will see what the withdrawal effects are. Last time I came off meds I had a manic episode which was quite embarrassing. I held a job at Walmart for 2 and a half years. I would say though that the biggest drawback is its effect on diminishing the user's willpower.",JediBill
9,Risperdal,Schizoaffective Disorder,2,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"February 21, 2016",19,"Beware of side effects! This medication caused Sexual side effects.

10,Risperdal,Schizoaffective Disorder,10,,"September 15, 2015",29,"I gained  100 pounds or more . I developed diabetes, and chronic kidney disease. I also could not keep my hands for moving, and at night my feet would twirl. I chose to stop using risperdal and withdrawal was horrible. The medicine did wonders for my mental health, but the side effects was worse than my schizophrenia.",shock1992

12,Risperdal,Schizoaffective Disorder,6,,"May 6, 2014",18,I think that it helps with the schizoaffective disorder they put me on it 2 yrs ago & now I don't hear the louds as much as I did before.,mmmm...
13,Risperdal,Schizoaffective Disorder,6,,"April 19, 2014",21,This medication worked wonders for me and I felt quite good on this medication. The problem lies with the side effects. Unbeknownst to me for many months was that it increased my prolactin levels which caused my breasts to grow and menstrual cycle to be off. High prolactin is harmful in the long run and my breasts never returned to their previous size (although maybe some of you ladies would be happy about it. I also gained a few pounds on Risperdal but nothing ridiculous.,ThisIsPatrick
14,Risperdal,Schizoaffective Disorder,6,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"February 28, 2014",33,"I was on risperidone for over a year. I suffer from severe manic depressive bipolar disorder with schizoaffective episodes. The medication along with an antidepressant helped with the delusions (visual and auditory). But the weight gain was immense in one year I gained over 60 pounds. I weigh over 300 pounds now and the depression is worse. I have osteoarthritis in both knees that with the weight have been severely debilitating. Preparing meals, doing daily activities are almost impossible. Standing for more than ten minutes is excruciating. I suggest to use caution with the increase in weight this medicine can cause.",katydid47
15,Risperdal,Schizoaffective Disorder,10,,"February 19, 2014",50,"I first went on this medication in March of 2013 and almost a year later, I've had to adjust it 3 times, going up to 4 finally. When I first started, I was sent into a manic like state for several hours, but after about a week, I started to sleep more than I ever did. I usually only got about 3 hours of sleep each and every night, starting from when I was 12 and up until I started Risperidone, which is when I was 18. It has helped with every single thing that was wrong with me, the delusions, hallucinations, dissociation, and homicidal feelings. I would definitely suggest trying this if you haven't yet. It worked wonders with me.",Anonymous
16,Risperdal,Schizoaffective Disorder,9,,"November 2, 2013",37,"I'm talking this after a few antipsychotics didn't work and I was hospitalized a few times for the first time in my life. My bipolar diagnosis changed to Schizoaffective disorder then Schizophrenia. The delusions paranoia was very scary. I was on 2 mg for awhile with Ativan and celexa, and I gained weight over the course of all the medicines, but it needed it, weight gain stopped when I stopped celexa. No paranoia. Now im taking 1  1/2 mg and have less anxiety, on a day I went back to 2 mg I had more. I still have anxiety and will ask my dr to increase my Ativan from 2 back to 3 mg, or lower my risperdal down to 1 mg a I am also on lithium and have hand tremors from that and risperdal, but feel stable it's so worth it. I'm staying on it",Anonymous 42 yr old F
17,Risperdal,Schizoaffective Disorder,10,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"July 23, 2013",56,"This has been a miracle for me, it keeps my mind calm and in balance. I had delusions coupled with moderate to severe mood disturbances and this puts me back on the normal spectrum.",gmura11
18,Risperdal,Schizoaffective Disorder,9,,"June 14, 2013",60,"Risperdal is my miracle. I put on about 30 pounds in the course of 18 months but that is nothing as to the improvement it has made on my mental well being.  Gone are the sleepless nights staring at the ceiling, delusions of grandeur, and being overly worried about life's ups and downs.  The psychosis has diminished to the point where I no longer need medication to remain stable.  If symptoms ever return, I know this is the medication for me.  Also no unpleasant side effects from coming off it.",anote2me12
19,Risperdal,Schizoaffective Disorder,4,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"June 19, 2012",42,"This was clearly not the medicine for me. The sleeping for 2 days once I went on it thing was okay. I needed it. But it made me so hungry that I gained 30 pounds, so tired that When I took this I cared about nothing, so bored and apathetic so quickly that my life felt without meaning. I began lactating 3 weeks in, and I couldn't concentrate on school. If anything, I got more paranoid...no voices, but OCD and paranoia and agitation through the roof. I was on 0.5 mg in the beginning and eventually went up to 3 mg.",Anonymous
20,Risperdal,Schizoaffective Disorder,6,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"May 18, 2012",34,"I was experiencing awful symptoms including visual and auditory hallucinations. I also had problems with ""feeling"" something crawling all over me. I felt like someone had taken advantage/control over my physical being. I was scared for my life, wondering if my hallucinations were real. Luckily, this medication has cleared these thoughts, and made the hallucinations better, but one moment clearly pointed out to me that the medication hadn't done any harm. I was laying in bed, and I started to laugh uncontrollably because I could actually lay there and listen to the quiet sounds all around me. I wasn't distracted by voices.",dee-carol-m
21,Risperdal,Schizoaffective Disorder,4,,"September 9, 2011",31,"I started taking risperidone when I was 15. It does take away the delusions and mood swings, but it leaves me with anxiety and dulls me out to the point where I don't feel like really socializing at all. I've tried other medicines like Zyprexa and Geodon and they either do the same thing or have another bad effect on me. I'm 20 now and still haven't really found a medicine that works. I think whatever they put in antipsychotics just doesn't agree with me.",Anonymous
22,Risperdal,Schizoaffective Disorder,6,,"May 25, 2011",16,Caused a lot of weight gain.,lm222
23,Risperdal,Schizoaffective Disorder,4,,"April 7, 2011",16,"When I started Risperdal it made my whole body shake the first day, but after that I was restless everyday and I couldn't sit down for long periods of time. The medicine helped a lot with delusions and hallucinations (including audio) and helped a bit with reality perception but did not help with irrational thinking. Gained 15 lbs.",Anonymous
24,Risperdal,Schizoaffective Disorder,6,,"November 1, 2010",19,"Risperdal did not eliminate my symptoms but it did make coping with the symptoms easier.  It also made me sleep extremely deeply at night so that someone who tried wasn't able to wake me up at all.  It could be due to low blood pressure but most likely because I have a low tolerance to sedative medications.  I was not able to take it during the day when I needed to the most, when my symptoms were at their worst, due to the sedative side effects.  I did find that using a 0.5mg dose was mildly helpful for daytime treatment of symptoms and was not severely sedative, allowing me to function normally.",anitalite
25,Risperdal,Schizoaffective Disorder,5,,"August 2, 2010",35,"This medicine has been okay for me. It certainly got rid of most of my paranoid thoughts but never got rid of all of them. I still had a lot of them especially present in the night, I'd think there was a serial killer outside watching me or a serial killer in the same room as me or on the chair. It was pretty terrifying. I started Geodon a week ago and those thoughts completely disappeared, I'm very grateful. Risperdal also made me gain a lot of weight every year and made me very hungry even after I just had a meal. I'm 166 lbs and 5'8'. I'm scared of being 200 lbs. I've been on this medicine since I was 14 and severely psychotic and couldn't function at all, so I guess it helped me with that, just made me gain a lot of weight. I'm 22 now.",Anonymous
26,Risperdal,Schizoaffective Disorder,8,,"March 23, 2010",24,Very good medication. helps alot with the symptoms of psychosis. Its not a cure though I still had to work on my problems. -1 point because it gives me dry mouth and makes it so a cannot tolerate as much alcohol. -1 another point cause its not 100 percent effective but still works great. overall 8/10,Anonymous
