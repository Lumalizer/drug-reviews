0,Quetiapine,Schizoaffective Disorder,10.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"January 29, 2022",0,"I’ve taken this drug at low doses and at high dosages, and I believe it to be very safe if taken only as prescribed. I only took the high doses at the start of a psychotic break where my symptoms were at all time high about 250 mg and it made the situation manageable the only side effects I can report on the high dosages is it caused my vision in my right eye to get noticeably blurry which caused some alarm but was gone when I awoke and never caused any sort of long term damage and you shouldn’t drive a car in this state. Mainly I took 50mg one tab a day for a month or so and then 25 mg tabs for the remainder of the time and it treated all my symptoms helped me sleep and eat and be better socially. I no longer take any medication and if I ever had too it’d be quietapine. It works slow but it gets the job done you will notice a huge improvement after month one. Pricing get the offbrand it works just as well.",Brandon
1,Quetiapine,Schizoaffective Disorder,2.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"January 23, 2022",0,"I just started this at 30mg. It knocked me for a loop. I had to cut the pills in half or I would fall down. I could barely make it upstairs to my bed! I am having nighttime hallucinations. All versions. This has just started and so my neurologist prescribed it for me. I don't want to take this everyday like you are supposed to. It definitely puts me out, but the next day I walk around groggily. This not something I will continue. I can't believe how high of a dosage some people are taking! Good luck!",Bluesguy

You can sleep through the hospital or jail time when you take seroquel extended release. Avoid aripiprazole, haldol, paliperidone and all the other ones. Seroquel is most least worse of all anti-psychotics doesn't block dopamine as much as all the others. Sedation is pretty heavy so take it at night time.",Doug
3,Quetiapine,Schizoaffective Disorder,1.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"October 5, 2021",1,I've taken quetiapine for 4 years now.  Since taking it I have Schizoaffective disorder type 1 diabetes and lot of ECGs since the heart palpitations giving me a lot of chest pains. Quetiapine was the cause of my type 1 diabetes confirmed with Doctors and chest pains to. And I believe my diagnosis as well as soon as I took quetiapine I had intrusive thoughts 24 hours of the day constantly with that and the severe anxiety it gives me I have OCD now. It been so hard for me to live with. I would advise people to take quetiapine with caution. Most attempts of coming of this drug made me ill. I would give this drug a 1 and doesn't even deserve that.,Tom
4,Quetiapine,Schizoaffective Disorder,1.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"October 3, 2021",3,Seroquel (quetiapine):1 of the worst meds I've ever taken was only on 25-50 milligrams a day made me extremely tired and my eyes black.  I'd wakeup feeling like I was being choked.  If I was trying to workout doing push ups for instance I'd get a sharp pain in my head and either my arm or leg or both would give out and I'd fall to the floor almost hurting myself.  I thought it was bad for me or I must be allergic to it so I had to refuse to take it anymore after a couple months. I can't believe they are still giving this to people without knowing how destructive it can be to people's lives. It's an older antipsychotic medicine they claim so how could they not know the brutal side effects it causes.,Survivor

Invega is the only drug currently approved for schizoaffective disorder, but .... I predict, in 2021, that Seroquel WILL eventually be approved for schizoaffective disorder too.

They gave me Invega, which did not work at all. After I was released, I still wasn't right at all. I ended up even getting arrested for criminal trespassing. I started doing therapy, and met with a medical provider. I asked to be put on Seroquel, because I could not sleep at all. I take 200mg a day, and it's very effective in stopping racing thoughts. You have to really watch what you eat on it. I have worked very hard to have gained zero weight. I also continue to take Doxepin, which I was previously prescribed.",Lou

I'm 18 now. I heard it's not possible to need this at that age but here I am. I think at first I was kinda empty, didn't talk, kinda a vegetable. Took about a while to get used to, maybe a week, then I remember completely losing it and attacking my brother and also feeling suicidal, but I didn't stop taking it when I was put in inpatient. Then everything got better, now I still hear and see things but only specific things and I talk to people more even though I have social anxiety. So it didn't really work for my hallucinations just maybe depression and anxiety.",Bunny

During that time, the drug has been effective. However, towards the end of 2020, I decided to have my eyes checked for the first time. I was having some farsightedness in my left eye. I am 37 years old and I have never had eye problems. Never been to an eye doctor. The doctor told me I had a cataract which is unusual for my age. She was baffled.  It wasn’t until later that I learned that cataracts are a rare side effect of seroquel. Not only that, Seroquel increased my AST/ liver enzymes and decreased my T4 levels, both rare side effects. It is even possible that it has contributed to my acid reflux.  The herculean effort is tapering off this medication while being able to sleep. I can’t give this drug a high score because of the problems it has caused and the extreme difficulty of getting off of it.  The drug has been very effective, but that has come at a high price.  I can’t get off Seroquel fast enough.",Patient#139

My motivation, especially in the morning is VERY low. I can't hold a job that starts early in the morning. Often times throughout the day, I don't know what to do with myself or what I should be striving for. I have much less output most days in terms of activity, speech, and overall communication, probably tied to not knowing what the hell I want. I upped my dose to 200mg from 150mg and the following nights, I woke up with a delusional thought, which was pretty scary. It's as hard as being psychotic to make up my mind on 150mg.

I haven’t noticed any positive changes at first since you have to give the drug couple of weeks to kick in. When it did kicked in, this drug changed my life. I was more positive, outgoing and overall in the elevated state of mind. The only downside to this drug was weight gain and too much sleep time. I’d still keep taking but it stopped working for me.

I was diagnosed with schizoaffective disorder at 16 ( I'm 18 now) and I’ve tried almost all second-generation antipsychotics since I was 13. ALL made me experience horrid side effects (extrapyramidal effects, paranoia, vomiting, emotionally flat). Seroquel within 2 days of taking it helped me feel relatively normal...with NO akathisia/extrapyramidal effects. I can sleep, I don’t feel anywhere as paranoid, the delusions have significantly decreased. The only thing that is a little funky is the hunger, but I can manage that. This drug has helped me live a normal life. I’m at 300mg now and this is my safe spot. For anyone considering this medication, go for it. It’s the only antipsychotic that has not made me crawl out of my skin and die mentally. Genuinely a wonderful drug.",Matt

19,Quetiapine,Schizoaffective Disorder,10.0,,"April 28, 2020",74,"Seroquel (quetiapine):10 years ago, while in college, I had a marijuana induced psychosis (didn't know this was possible) & wound up in the ER. Don't remember 95% of events but apparently I thought the hospital staff was trying to kill me, was uncooperative & pulling IVs out of my arm.  They had an officer restrain me & he decided it was a good idea to tase me in the head.  I fell down and suffered a fractured skull, concussion & the next day my nightmare began.  I developed PTSD, couldn't sleep, panic attacks, hyper-vigilance etc. I was close to ending my life when I found a $300/hr Psych. who started me on Seroquel immediately. Within 24hrs I felt almost as good as before the incident happened. I was on it for a year and stopped as the doc told me I could stop if I didn't have any psychoses in that time. Very grateful for that doc and Seroquel. Everyone should have medical care like I found regardless of their ability to pay $300/hr; fortunately my parents could afford it.",Sam

I am now on 350mg for about 2 years now. 500mg made me sleep a 9 hour nite plus about 3 hours of naps every day. Also, as I got into my 40’s, 500 mg started giving me heart palpitations, scary enough that one time I thought I was going to die and had my adult son sit on my bed and hold my hand because I got scared I was going to die.I went down to 350 mg and it doesn’t give me that effect.Part of schitzoaffective is the inability to have relationships. The Seroquel doesn’t seem to help with this, or the inability to care about much. But it does help with paranoid delusions, and depression. I basically go around emotionally flat. But if you spent all of your pre medication life crying, scared and suicidal, feeling flat is a relief.I am Canadian and disabled (only working part time at minimum wage) so my meds are $0.",Eileen Wornos

27,Quetiapine,Schizoaffective Disorder,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"October 23, 2019",5,Well this time I am technically using seroquel 50mg for sleep issues though it does help with my schizoaffective as well. When I first tried this years ago I slept for 23 hours after one 50 mg pill then felt like a zombie for 2 days after. This time I slept for about 12 hours and now I just feel really relaxed like I took a muscle relaxer and I don't feel stressed out anymore about the road workers ripping up our road outside -  the reason I have had trouble sleeping the last 3 weeks. Finally got some good sleep. I also want to say for all the people using this and saying it makes them hungry. I actually ate dinner before taken the pill and so I didn't have the issue of feeling hungry after taken it. So try to eat something that is filling before taken the pill and it might help to deal with the hunger issue. Just a suggestion I know everyone is different on medication.,IllumiFox

On one hand, I've been on everything for depression (specifically), and nothing helped. I'm talking like 20  medications here, so it's been a rollercoaster.  most antidepressants were useless for me and the time period for effectiveness is usually over 1 month. Seroquel usually takes 2 weeks to start having an effect. It works for my depression - but I'm sedated and have to sleep a lot. Being a student can make this challenging. shift work and the like would be hard too. It's my last bet for now because I literally start to crumble to psychosis without it. However it is debilitating and feels restrictive. Beats the psych ward I guess.    good luck and keep trying,  sometimes it takes a while.",Rayacccc

Now occasionally I have taken one and a half pills if I want to fall asleep quicker but you really have to be careful with this drug because many things can happen. The side effects I've experienced mainly is trouble swallowing which scares me to death when I'm trying to sleep and I'm panicking & my heartbeats racing yet I can't swallow.
