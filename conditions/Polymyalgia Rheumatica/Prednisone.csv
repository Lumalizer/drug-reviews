0,Prednisone,Polymyalgia Rheumatica,9,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"November 22, 2021",0,"I was in bad pain in my shoulders and knees for 4 or 5 months until I crawled into the Dr. office. I was 61 and worked out religiously and ate well and ate the bad stuff too. I lifted heavy weight and was in good shape. When he Dr. saw me he made a spot diagnosis and gave me a steroid injection he thought would last for a couple of weeks. It lasted really well for a couple of days. He put me on 20mg prednisone for a week then 10mg for a week and then stopped the medication. I had a bad relapse. I went back on the same regimen but this time I went to 5mg and was doing ok, not great but ok. The rheumatologist has tried to get me off the meds but it does not work right now. So I take 2.5 mg a day and it gets me through with turmeric, fish oil and a daily ibuprofen. As well as massage hot and cold showers and workouts and vitamins. Some days are pretty good and some days are worse if a get a three bad days in a row I take 3.75 one night and that helps. So far no bad symptoms.",Daniel
1,Prednisone,Polymyalgia Rheumatica,8,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"September 23, 2021",1,"Works well for me. However, while tapering off it does not provide as much relief and prevents me from using hands/fingers for simple tasks.",Joseph
2,Prednisone,Polymyalgia Rheumatica,1,,"October 20, 2020",8,"I am sorry to hear about your PMR and the medication not working. I developed PMR aged 55 and went from pretty fit to decrepit in a few months, I felt dreadful. I think the menopause and low iron levels compounded a predisposing condition. I stubbornly refused oral and even injectable steroid treatment as I was so wary of the side effects. It was a struggle to keep as active as possible and I am grateful for sympathetic working conditions. I have never been able to go back to full time hours, I still have fatigue and aches 6 years later but (Thank Goodness) none of the excruciating pain of the active process. How any older, less fit person copes with this I do not know. I feel that if this illness affected a younger population, there would be more investigation into treatment other than steroids (but that is just my opinion). May your recovery be swift and same for everyone with this or any other chronic life-changing illness.",Polly
3,Prednisone,Polymyalgia Rheumatica,1,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"September 27, 2020",6,"I was recently diagnosed with PMR (Polymyalgia Rheumatica).  My Rheumatologist started me on prednisone, 15 mg. a day.  It did nothing for the pain.  From what I've read, prednisone is the best medication for PMR and I should see relieve within a few days.  I didn't see any relief.  My dr. has changed meds to Lyrica. Lyrica is doing nothing for the pain either.   Does anyone have any comments about what has help you?  I don't understand why nothing is helping.",Don't undertand
4,Prednisone,Polymyalgia Rheumatica,8,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"September 26, 2020",13,"I was diagnosed January 2020 and prescribed prednisone 10mg daily by my specialist. It took a week for me to feel 100% relief.  I felt like an energetic bunny. By February I began tapering.  By April I had a setback & became ill  because I was tapering too quickly.  Doctor adjusted my dose and the symptoms went away.  Yet, I developed elevated BP & BPM, tingling sensation in left arm, constipation with bloating & gas causing gastritis.  I was prescribed Metropolol beta blocker and Prilosec.  I finally finished my Prednisone regimen beginning of August 2020.  I stopped the beta blocker a month later.  I felt my adrenals take over.  My old arthritis in lower back & knee returned.  Now I am recovering from pain in my mid-back area.  My mood is not good.  I'm feeling anxiety/depression because of these new symptoms.  I do not want to ever take Prednisone again.",chicagopd
5,Prednisone,Polymyalgia Rheumatica,10,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"July 19, 2020",18,"I developed PMR about three years ago. Pain so severe in my hips and shoulders that I couldn't lie down, so slept (fitfully) in a chair for six months, while undergoing tests (RA? Fibromyalgia? Leukemia? ...). Finally the doctors agreed that I had PMR, and referred me to a rhematologist, who put me on an initial daily dose of 15mg prednisone. The pain vanished within 48h, and I haven't had a recurrence. I was on a tapered dosage of prednisone for about 6 months, followed by methotrexate for a year. No side effects, other than waking up earlier than usual, which is a small price to pay for continuing pain relief.",bobbyrobson
6,Prednisone,Polymyalgia Rheumatica,6,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"December 27, 2019",24,"Initial visit to the ER with pain from neck to hips. Prescribed  a dose of Prednisone at 20mg for two days then the dose was decreased to 10mg  from then on. No relief for two weeks. Doctor said to double it. Went back to 20mg. No relief for another week. Today I was increased to 30mg. No relief this evening. Everything I read says within a few hours! What am I doing wrong? I can't walk, sleep, bend over, tie my own shoes. And I've gone from weight lifting and aerobic exercise five days a week for the past six years to sitting in my recliner every day. I'm a 62 year old active woman.",Pamgeee57
