0,Famciclovir,Herpes Simplex MucocutaneousImmunocompetent Host,8,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"September 10, 2021",1,Famvir (famciclovir):I use famvir since 2018 .Usually  2x500 per 3/4 days and then 1x500 for other 2/3 days depending on the severity. It should be taken immediately and greatly shortens the healing time but causes tiredness or agitation and headache. Avoid the sun. I use it for genital herpes that I have for 20 years 11 on the buttocks. I hope for better medicine with fewer other problems but this helps a lot,italia

3,Famciclovir,Herpes Simplex MucocutaneousImmunocompetent Host,10,,"September 25, 2008",34,"Famvir (famciclovir):I have been taken Famvir for a year. I had multiple outbreaks in the past, but I take Famvir daily and I have only had 2 mild outbreaks within a year. It really helps not having the pain and depression with outbreaks. It is a great medication and made my life better.",sarasotamel
4,Famciclovir,Herpes Simplex MucocutaneousImmunocompetent Host,8,,"May 26, 2008",8,"I used to have canker sore pain for two weeks that was so bad I could not talk or eat without constant pain.  Now, as soon as I feel a sore or more that hurts a lot, I start my treatment of 1 pill per day for 5 days and the pain is reduced to a very tolerable amount.  The pain goes away in a few days altogether.  I only use the pills for the very painful outbreaks. Some sores don't warrant the need to risk unneccessary medicine.  I know when it is time to start medicating when the pain consumes.",Anonymous
