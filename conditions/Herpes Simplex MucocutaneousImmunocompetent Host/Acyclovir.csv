0,Acyclovir,Herpes Simplex MucocutaneousImmunocompetent Host,5,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"November 7, 2015",1,"I first was inflicted with Herpes Simplex in my right eye over 35 year ago. Treatment then consisted of getting rid of the virus including steroids and then weening off all meds. Much similar now but Dr. prescribed Acyclovir to protect against the re-occurance. Ever since I started taking the drug, my eye socket aches, my eye waters and is red, plus I get occasional  hot flash. My Dr has cut my dose in half from 400ml to 200 ml. but i still have the symptoms. I will go back and request an alternative medication.",Vetera Herpes Simplex Victim
