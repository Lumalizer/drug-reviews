0,Indomethacin,Cluster Headaches,7,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"December 2, 2020",3,"Use indomethacin 25mg to deal with severe tension headaches. Definitely effective in managing the headaches, downside is that I feel very 'spaced out' and as a result anxious.",Pix
1,Indomethacin,Cluster Headaches,8,Taken for 5 to 10 years,"October 17, 2020",1,"I have been suffering from chronic migraines and indomethacin does helps to get rid of them within 2 hours. Although, used often does result in headaches.",JMK
2,Indomethacin,Cluster Headaches,6,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"August 14, 2020",2,"Indomethacin is very effective for pain management, I can take as little as 5 mg to get relief (I buy empty capsules and divide the dosage), up to 25 mg if the pain is severe. I also manage the pain very well with ice (Bed Buddy wrapped around my head and stronger), and some pain distraction techniques.  Indomethacin has side effects: tired, grumpy, mean, and hard on my kidneys, so I don’t take it during the day when I can manage the pain with ice, only just before bed so I don’t wake up in excruciating pain. Another pill which helps if the pain is not too bad is Vanquish (the caffeine constricts the blood vessels, poundy-poundy-pulse).",Ice Princess
3,Indomethacin,Cluster Headaches,10,,"February 22, 2020",5,"After trying several OTC meds for several days, my doctor called this in and within 3 hours my debilitating headache was gone.

5,Indomethacin,Cluster Headaches,8,Taken for less than 1 month,"August 10, 2019",4,"I was given this indomethacin medication by my PCP for ice pick headaches and was to take it three times daily for 10 days and this is the only effective treatment. The good news is within 1 day of meds my headaches were gone. The bad news is I can not tolerate the side effects. Total dizziness, anxious feeling and heart racing within an hour of taking it. We are going to try to take it less often to see if side effects decrease. ",Anonymous
6,Indomethacin,Cluster Headaches,9,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"June 17, 2019",8,"Indocin (indomethacin):I have cluster headaches and hemicrania continuum which is diagnosed by taking indomethacin. I also have fibromyalgia which means I have really bad reactions to every medication I take and I have to take this twice a day every day. I take the lowest dose possible (25mg twice daily) even though it doesn’t give me 100% relief it gives me about 95% and I know there’s bad side effects but as long as I eat a full meal before I take it I have not experienced anything other than my face having a little rash, but I don’t have any of the other problems. As soon as I quit taking it it just comes back so to me this is a lifesaver that is worth the slight rash!",Kat
7,Indomethacin,Cluster Headaches,9,,"November 26, 2017",8,"I have hemicrania headaches since 2005. Tried everything and indomethicin works, only problem now is chronic kidney disease. Trying to find alternative drug, extremely scared of further debilitating headaches. Taking 50mg 3x daily, cut down from 4x daily seems to work.",wp
8,Indomethacin,Cluster Headaches,8,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"March 1, 2017",6,I have hemicrania continua since 1999. First attempt of indo made me ten foot tall.  Second attempt when I had stopped working worked fine.  Indo completely got rid of the pain after a few days of taking it.  Trouble is two years later I forgot to take it one day and the pain is back with a vengeance. Neurologist reckoned it should start working again after 6 weeks but it hasn't.  Now taking carbamazepine for trigemenial neuralgia.,Dawnthomson

11,Indomethacin,Cluster Headaches,9,,"February 13, 2013",10,I've been taking indomethacin at the onset of headache along with twice a day doses of Topamax. The combination works well to control my cluster headaches and I only have them about every other month now.,Lynne2620
12,Indomethacin,Cluster Headaches,8,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"May 23, 2012",12,"Prescribed 50mg indomethacin daily for Cluster Headaches along with 180mg Verapamil. While the Verapamil dosage seemed completely ineffective, the Indomethacin was almost completely successful at eliminating onset of headaches (nominally 4-5 times per day). Changed dosage to 25mg Indomethacin morning and evening, which was slightly less effective as the medication seemed to wear off in about 7-8 hrs.",David Gorrell
13,Indomethacin,Cluster Headaches,7,,"September 6, 2009",9,Helps with pain when used with some other pain medications. Sort of boosts effects of vicodin or even helps by itself.,mindydear
