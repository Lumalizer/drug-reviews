2,Verapamil,Cluster Headaches,10.0,Taken for 10 years or more,"October 27, 2020",5,"I have suffered from cluster headaches for over 50 years.  I was first diagnosed as normal migraines and treated as such, to no avail.I did extensive research and suggested to my Dr. that perhaps these were cluster headaches.  I was given Imitrex injections and they worked wonderful- relief in less than 5 mins usually.  The problem with Imitrex was they did not prevent reoccurrence.  Finally my Dr. prescribed verapamil and I have been on it for 35-40 years- no headaches!  I have tried to wean myself off gradually, but soon got my 'warning signs' of a cluster headache approaching.  Went back to usual dosage of 80 mg 2 times a day.  It also seems to reduce my blood pressure.",stv
3,Verapamil,Cluster Headaches,10.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"October 6, 2020",3,"I have suffered from cluster migraines for nearly fifty years.  The only help I received was from methysergide until the medicine was withdrawn.  The neurologist tried me on other remedies but none  had worked.   I then changed to Verapamil 3 x 80mg a day, this helped but did not really remedy the situation completely.   I now take the Verapamil with one 0.5mg Clonzepam twice a day.  The result is amazing, from my normal clusters lasting three months at a time, I am now completely free of pain.  As with others you get the sensation of a migraine, weeping eye etc, but with no pain.  Of all the medicines tried over the years ranging from Lithium to Oxygen, this is by far the best for me.  I’ve been in my latest cluster ( they last for about twelve weeks, with an eighteen month gap between episodes)  with not one real migraine.  I do have Triptan  Injections  as a back up, but have never need to take one.",Dill
4,Verapamil,Cluster Headaches,9.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"April 1, 2020",6,"I’m a 43 year old male in good health. I get episodic cluster headaches about every 2-4 years lasting 4-8 weeks. My cluster headaches started in my early 30’s. I only take Verapamil during a cluster cycle. My neurologist prescribed Verapamil ER 240mg as a preventative at that time. With my most recent episode, breakthrough headaches that require a triptan were gone after 2 days of Verapamil and 4mg methyl-prednisone. After about 3 weeks of onset and 2 weeks of no prednisone, I still have symptoms and headaches but not the debilitating type. I can work and go through most of my normal routine without much issue.",Jack Flash
5,Verapamil,Cluster Headaches,10.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"February 26, 2020",7,"Started using Verapamil after a year of Cluster Headaches, on advice from Neurologist (here in UK).  I was getting them nearly every night about a couple of hours after going to sleep.  Some were truly terrible, lasting several hours.  Nasal sumatriptan was a huge help, but did not prevent the worst attacks.  Sleep disruption led to a minor breakdown at work and I had to resign from my job.   Started using Verapamil SR (Slow Release) 120mg twice per day.  Headaches stopped immediately.  I had many months pain free, an utter blessed relief.  They then returned very faintly, but making me feel unwell for 2-3 days at a time. I increased the dose to 240mg twice per day and that has been better.  I intend to lower the dose again after a while, to try to minimise the drug intake. But frankly I am thankful each day for the scientists, doctors and manufacturers who between them have created Verapamil.",Montyaston
6,Verapamil,Cluster Headaches,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"December 7, 2019",7,"I have been suffering from cluster headaches for about 10 years and diagnosed 5 years ago.Maxalt wafers helped but were taking too long to act.  Then I got the sumatriptan injections and it was a life saviour as they work in less than 5 minutes. I am lucky to only get them every 3 years for 4 weeks ,once a day and then gone until this last cycle. It has been 8 weeks and I get up to 2 a night. Those Injections work but at $140 a day and are almost impossible to find where I am . I was terrified knowing I couldn’t  get the life saving pain relief I needed so I went to a neurologist. It was actually 2 days ago. The plan is 10 days on prednisone and start verapamil and increase the dosage slowly. I am thinking of skipping the steroids as I am really worried of their side effects and just start the verapamil while using the injections I have left for pain relief until it starts working. Excited to see if it works and the cost is so much lower too.",Dawn

I used to get between 3 and 8 clusters daily for several months in a row.  Once I was prescribed Calan SR (verapamil) the cluster headaches stopped.

8,Verapamil,Cluster Headaches,10.0,,"January 16, 2019",26,"I was misdiagnosed for years. I went to a sinus specialist and was also referred to chiropractor. I spent thousands of dollars out of pocket having my neck cracked. Often during attacks. Because my cluster attacks typically last about 3 hours I thought the chiropractor was actually doing something.  I also think it affected my marriage and that my wife did not believe the severity of the headaches.  Finally my chiropractor told me his treatments were not working. My neck muscles were tight but my alignment was fine. I was experiencing one of the worst attacks I’d had. He sent me to the walk in clinic and a PA actually listened to me and she knew immediately what was wrong. She prescribed 240mg Verapamil SR once a day, took me off Ibuprofen entirely and prescribed Imitrex Nasal for abortive. I still get some attacks. I now go months with no headaches and when I do enter a cluster period the attacks are much less severe.  I also use O2 to treat an attack before it gets severe.",SkiPat

I worked out, maintained a healthy weight, and ate healthy. So I had no clue what this was and why they were happening, my very astute doctor diagnosed Cluster Headaches.

I first got on verapamil around 18 when I finally had a diagnosis and good doctor. It’s been very effective for me. Thing is it mucked up my hormones and made me lactate (!!) so I had to take other medication to control that. I’m now withdrawing progressively from verapamil as we want to have children and the medication gets through placenta and breast milk. So for so good, so I might be in a time without headaches.

11,Verapamil,Cluster Headaches,9.0,Taken for 10 years or more,"December 15, 2017",7,"Hi, suffered Cluster Headache for 14 years. Verapamil is great. Usually I can stay cluster free on 240-360 mg /day but having a bad episode at the moment and on 960mgs.  This is the worst I have had for many years and I think brought on by season change and a recent bad cough which lasted around 6 weeks. Also Imigram injections as an abortive work very well.  I notice that a few people mention taking Verapamil SR (Sustained or Slow Release). This is not the drug you need I promise you. You need the fast release Verapamil without the SR. I was mistakenly prescribed these when first diagnosed and while they helped the positive difference when switched to the non-SR drug was staggering.",PeterB80
12,Verapamil,Cluster Headaches,6.0,,"October 8, 2017",6,"Hello, I'm a 36 yr old male suffering from chronic cluster headaches since the age of 19. For the first 15 years I would get 1-2 attacks daily with a week being the longest without an attack. I tried everything from nerve block injections to pain meds with nothing being effective and doctors thinking I only suffered from migraines or just wanted pain meds when all I ever wanted was any kind of relief. A few years ago they started getting worse and the attacks increased to 4, 5 even up to 7 a day. Imigran 6 mg shots helped when I got one at work but who can take that many shots a day or live in that kind of pain. I finally read about verapamil online and tried 240mg a day first and it completely changed my life. Unfortunately they have now returned",wannabepainfree
13,Verapamil,Cluster Headaches,10.0,,"August 30, 2017",2,"I had regular clusters every August throughout my 20s and 30s. They went away when I had sinus surgery at age 40. Then they restarted in early May this year, at the age of 63. Verapamil 240 milligram has been completely effective in stopping them. (Unfortunately, they may have turned chronic -- whenever I experimentally quit the Verapamil, they resume.) I have one major side-effect: a daily two- or three-hour bout of diarrhea. Imodium and similar meds leave me with a painful case of constipation followed by...diarrhea. I have adopted a low-mass, low-irritant diet, and this mitigates it somewhat, but it does not solve it. My doc has directed me to try a lower dose (120 mg.) in the hope that this will mitigate this side effect.",Chuck E.

This time, new doctor prescribed verapamil.  Virtually made the headaches disappear within 48 hours.  Had to stop taking the medications once a week to see if they were gone so I could discontinue the use of the medication.

Essential Oils Peppermint rubbed on the temples and back of the neck which for me is the first indication of an onset has proven effective too. Guys are expected to grow out of it in our fifties.

It works, but I must stress that you must stop drinking any alcohol whatsoever - NONE, don't even smell the bottle (no kidding!) Also, for me, other sure triggers include dark chocolate, white chocolate, but small quantities of milk chocolate are OK. Also, stay away from MSG (monosodium glutamate). Verapamil WILL work, but you have to stay away from triggers to give it a chance! It might take a week or two. I also had to spread it out to 3 times in a day, rather than all in one dose for it to block all headaches at first. Now I'm on 2x120mg and headache-free!",anubis44

51,Verapamil,Cluster Headaches,10.0,,"July 25, 2011",38,"I am writing this about my son...4 years ago is when the headaches started. As he got older they got worse and worse. His migraines would last 45mins to 2 hours long and have 4-5 headaches a day. He lost his job because of this terrible nightmare, couldn't do anything but stay home and deal with this terrible pain. He at that point had no medical insurance and I was desperate to find out what was wrong with him. I began to search for some kind of emergency help and called Valley Medical. Had a CT scan, and saw a Neorolgist and put him on Verapamil and he has no more headaches. Our nightmare is finally over and I want to thank Valley Medical for all their help with their wonderful doctors to help my son. Now he can live a normal, pain-free life.",Anonymous
