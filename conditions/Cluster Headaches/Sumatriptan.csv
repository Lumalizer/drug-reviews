I feel like I will throw up and go all sweaty, the only thing I can do is try to sleep straight away so I sleep through the symptoms while people keep checking on me.The thing is with all these horrendous side effects it’s still a million times worth it to stop the pain of a cluster headache!

7,Sumatriptan,Cluster Headaches,10.0,Taken for 5 to 10 years,"September 8, 2020",3,"I told my primary care physician of headaches I was having.    Not especially severe but very persistent and not responding well to otc meds.   It would often require several otc doses over two to three days to obtain relief.    He gave me some Relpax samples and I took one at the onset of the next headache.   I had relief in about thirty minutes.    I was extremely pleased and continued use of the Relpax for perhaps two years until my insurer refused to cover that med any longer due to cost. My primary care prescribed sumatriptan as a replacement. It was equally effective, usually providing relief in as little as fifteen minutes. I used sumatriptan for perhaps three more years, then my headaches simply stopped - completely.     Have not had a headache requiring medication in the last six years.   Can't explain it, but I'll take it.   I never experienced noticeable side effects with either medication.   Am currently (sept 2020) 71 year old male.",tk7643

Brutal, soul crushing headaches maybe 100 to 200 times more painful than a common tension headache. Read about Sumatran and asked my doctor. He prescribed it about 2 years ago. It's been a miracle for me.Completely gets rid of the headache within 15 to 20 minutes. No side effects of any kind. To those who have experienced side effects I might suggest taking a half or even a quarter dose. I was prescribed 20 mg and I usually cut them in half and 10 mg works great for me. If 10 mg is an effective dose, at least for some people as I can attest, then I can only imagine what taking 10 times the dose for your body or system might do, as I'm reading some people here were prescribed 50 or even 100 mg.Hope this helps.",Mike
10,Sumatriptan,Cluster Headaches,1.0,,"August 12, 2019",8,"I go to a headache clinic to deal with my intense cluster/migraine headache bouts.  My doctor asked me to try sumatriptan as an option for dealing with the worst headaches as soon as I feel them come on.  I liked the idea of having something to take only during headache periods, as opposed to daily.  I had the opportunity to give it a shot this weekend and... woah.Sumatriptan does NOT agree with my system.  Shortly after taking it, my scalp at the crown of my head felt like it was on fire.  So painful.  The back of my neck also seized up and I had to lie down, even though it was impossible to get comfortable.  The good thing is that this medication has a short half-life (two hours), so my discomfort, though intense, was short-lived.  Did my headache fade away?  Absolutely, but the discomfort it was swapped out for was arguably worse and so scary.  I'm returning the remainder of this prescription to the pharmacy for disposal.",BeeeDeee

My neck and shoulder on the side of the cluster pain end up feeling exhausted after I take it, like I've just been working out, but since the headaches typically wake me up, feeling exhausted helps me get back to sleep pretty quickly.

It is 2 to 3 steps higher than advil but less riskier. I reach for the Sumatriptan box but at the last minute I pull away.

When the next bout hit I asked about the injections as the tablets didn't always work/work quick enough. Doctor agreed and I got Imigran 6mg. Wow. Just wow. Aborts the headache within a couple of minutes of injection (which is simple and easy). They are a lifesaver and I would recommend anybody who suffers cluster headaches to ask your doctor about it.

Sumatriptan has been extremely helpful for me this cluster period. I use the tablets so it takes about 30 minutes to feel the effects. I take it as soon as I start to feel tension in the head and neck, with the slight onset of a headache. By the time it starts to work, the attack is almost in full force, but once it kicks in the pain immediately subsides and begins to quickly go away. It saves me at least a good hour of the intense, tortuous pain - which also saves me a lot of the side effects of the attacks such as nausea and fatigue. I've found little to no side effects along with the drug, so I'm almost immediately able to function afterwards",Aquaholic

49,Sumatriptan,Cluster Headaches,10.0,,"July 29, 2013",12,"I'm 46 yrs old and was diagnosed with cluster headaches in my late 20's. I was prescribed sumatriptan last week due to my new spell which started 2 weeks ago, and the medicine is working great for me. When ones coming on, I take a 50mg pill, and it starts working within minutes. I feel and hear crackling noises in my head, as well as my nasal cavity and eye socket, and miraculously it starts to lift away. In some cases though I had to take a second pill because the first didn't work completely, but within 30 to 45 minutes I'm relaxed and pain free. Since they've taken Cafergot off the market I've been without any medicine at all, trying steroids my neurologist experimented with, which didn't work at all. Sumatriptan is working.",Sman1166

I took it again the next day though because it did take care of my headache. Since the first time I took it, the side effects have been minor. Hopefully it stays this way.",trixiesmama5825
52,Sumatriptan,Cluster Headaches,5.0,,"February 8, 2013",7,"This is the first time I have used Sumatriptan , it was Arrow-Sumatriptan injection.  I immediately felt a slight pressure in my chest and a pushing in my temples and the base of my skull and felt tired and weak.  There was a tingling sensation in my nose and my throat was ultra sensitive.  It is an hour since I injected and my cluster headache has eased but not gone away yet.  My eye has stopped streaming and nose not running so fast and I look slightly more human.  I had hoped for better than this but it is an improvement.",Angela Judith

First doc prescribed Frova which didn't help at all, but the most recent doctor I've seen prescribed sumatriptan.  I can't believe how quickly this worked. My headaches usually lasted 3 hours  even after taking 3-4 Aleve.  Sumatriptan has knocked them out in 15 minutes.  I feel a bit jittery after, and have extreme taste sensitivity for a few hours, but it's well worth it.  This medicine is a miracle.",mikey s
