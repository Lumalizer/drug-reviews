0,Zolmitriptan,Cluster Headaches,10,,"April 3, 2019",9,"I have had chromic migraines and cluster headaches for years. This month I was having multiple auras a day and was bedridden for the entire month. I was at my wits end, thinking about ending my life because I can't live like this anymore. I also have fibromyalgia and multiple other diagnoses and these migraines are just too much on top of everything else. Very low quality of life until I started this med. I experience about 1-2 hours of side effects, they improve if I eat and take an anti nausea pill. Once that time is up I'll still feel a little achey and puffy throat and slight remaining nausea, these side effects are a cake walk when compared to the daily suffering and excruciating migraines. Highly recommend; just be prepared for intense initial side effects, stay calm, eat a piece of toast and ride it out. I feel hope for the first time in a long time and am grateful to be able to get on with my life!",Tinyfire
1,Zolmitriptan,Cluster Headaches,9,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"July 31, 2018",3,"I have been using the nasal spray for 2 years now. when I first began getting migraines I literally had to stop everything I was doing and go to bed. This brought on anxiety quite significantly, I'd go out and worry constantly that if I got a migraine I wasn't close enough to home and that would ultimately ruin the rest of my day. They impacted on my relationship, work and also my social life because I never wanted to do anything in fear of getting a migraine and needing to be close to my bed and a dark and quiet room. My migraines are gone within 30 minutes with the nasal spray and it really has changed my life. I dread the day my body becomes too used to it and it loses its effectiveness. I can honestly say I've had no adverse side effects from medication that I can notice.",Han
2,Zolmitriptan,Cluster Headaches,9,,"September 8, 2011",15,"I have suffered with ""cluster headaches"" for over 30 years. Finally I went to a neurologist who diagnosed me with cluster headaches and migraine headaches 10 years ago.  Cluster headaches would come, in my case, in March and October.  Whenever I would fall asleep at night I would awaken with horrible cluster headache. This would happen for about 3-4 weeks.  Zomig mist worked every time.  Unfortunately, since August 2010  pattern has changed  NOW every time I lay down or I could be sitting and BAM I feel the symptoms creeping up on me.  Yes the Zomig mist works like a charm and I have tried the dissolving tablets too, the mist works faster.  Why so expensive??? Big problems with insurance coverage regarding quantity too.  Help me Astra Zeneca.",Anonymous
