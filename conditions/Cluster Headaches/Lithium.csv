4,Lithium,Cluster Headaches,10,,"April 2, 2013",36,"Lithium saved my life.  Nothing worked on my cluster headaches until my Dr. prescribed lithium.  It was miraculous and worked within 24 hours.  It broke the cycle.  Subsequently I have also used oxygen therapy and it too has been very effective.  Just not as easy as taking a pill, but less side effects.",Anita12234
5,Lithium,Cluster Headaches,10,,"October 13, 2011",45,"I have been suffering from horrible daily chronic cluster/migraine for 30 years with absolutely no relief. My neurologist refused to put me on lithium. According to him it's an out of date medicine that belongs in the past. I have been on lithium for 2 weeks and have had my first headache free period in so many years. I went to my PCP and he gave me lithium. If you are not satisfied with current treatment, I do recommend this for chronic clusters/ migraines. ",Anonymous
6,Lithium,Cluster Headaches,10,,"July 6, 2011",29,I suffer from chronic clusters. Lithium has me pain free so compared to the pain I would be suffering I can live with the side effects.,spawndish
7,Lithium,Cluster Headaches,2,,"December 23, 2010",39,"My GP thinks the symptoms of what I thought was Parkinson's is in fact side-effects of Lithium. I take 1200 mg of lithium daily. I gave it a low score for the side-effects, the shakes and poor balance. It's very effective in preventing clusters. I took a chance this fall and quit all my medicines. The day after I did this I got slammed by clusters. Clusters are too painful to live with so it's better to live with lithium and its side effects than with the pain of cluster headaches.",road2glory
