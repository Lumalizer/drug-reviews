1,Clonazepam,Panic Disorder,10.0,,"March 9, 2022",0,"Klonopin (clonazepam):I have had severe anxiety my whole life. I work extremely hard and I am very successful at work because of my anxiety I am told. But when I am off work or not busy I have absolutely horrible panic attacks that have put me in the hospital. It makes me not want to go to the store, travel, do anything but try and stay calm. I would have heart palpitations, trouble breathing, stomach bloating. You name it, I had it. Klonopin took all those symptoms away. I take .5mg in the morning and 1mg at night. Sometimes I don't take it in the morning. I have used this drug in the past for a year and stopped cold turkey with no withdrawal because I was not feeling anxious anymore. This drug is great if you need it. Don't abuse it, take as prescribed and don't take it if you don't need it.",Rekkitrob

I haven’t experienced any side effects and it has greatly decreased my symptoms of panic. I am prescribed .50 mg but sometime I only need .25mg.

Then one day my world flipped upside down. Events in my life cause extreme anxiety which cost me to have zero sleep. I’ve heard so many bad things about Klonopin that I was scared to start it again. The doctors tried every SSRI, every sleep med and I went deeper deeper into crazy land. I ended up breaking down and taking .5mg a night, which I’ve stayed on that amount now for 5 years and it helps along with a half pill of unisom. I can’t take any ssri and at times I beat myself up about having to take it but it works so well for me. I did have issues with the generics so name brand only works well... I will probably be on them for life and right now I’m ok with that",Cole

I got in with a psychiatrist who prescribed clonazepam, and it made me feel normal again within hours of taking it for the first time. It gave me my life back. I've been taking it for 2 years, 0.5 mg twice daily, no increase in dosage...and it still works like it did on day 1. Only side effects I experienced initially were some slight dizziness, daytime drowsiness (naps helped!), and sexual dysfunction (it was hard to maintain an erection, I'm a male in my 20's) for the first week of use. My body got used to the drug very quickly and now I have had no side effects whatsoever. Clonazepam gave me my life back.

My doctor had tried all of the other meds (SSRIs, SNRIs, etc) and they made me worse and they made me angry and suicidal.  I was put on 1 mg of clonazepam 2x a day and after a few days of being really sleepy suddenly I wasn’t sleepy and I was able to function!  I could think about other things beyond when my next attack was coming and it was lovely.  Then things changed.  My doctor didn’t want to prescribe even though I had gone down to 1 mg a day on my own and never asked her to increase the dose.  The psychiatrist told me to taper myself off with only 2 weeks worth of pills left and gave me Buspar.  I found a new psychiatrist who put me back on and has worked with me for a year to do a slow taper.  Now I only use it as needed.

Started at 0.5mg at night and went up to 1mg at night in 2020. Most initial side effects go away within a couple weeks. I am dependent but not addicted. It makes me so tired, I have no desire to take it during daytime plus it has a long half life and manages my anxiety. I started off with Teva brand and then Accord in 2019 when Teva dropped the drug. Teva last month re-introduced its version and its not as good as the older version. I've swapped over to brand name at my own expense. It is worth the cost to have control of my anxiety. It doesn't work for everyone and I would exercise self control while taking it (no extra doses, alcohol, drugs, etc.). Also, it is technically not for insomnia so it won't help everyone with sleep issues.",Jackson

Never increased dosage but in fact have lowered when able.  Panic attacks are gone.  Anxiety is gone.  Tried Ativan in the beginning and I had severe reaction.   Anxiety is a chemical imbalance.

This medication has given me my life back. I am resistant to normal anxiety medications, and I cannot re-challenge due to metabolic issues. I am on Seroquel, Lamotrigine, and Dexedrine for a sleep disorder. This medication will stop panic attacks within 30 minutes, and will stop brewing psychotic episodes within a few days if I take it daily. I receive 30 a month and can take 0.5-1MG. This medicine doesn’t knock you silly like Xanax. It lets you breathe, slows the thoughts down, and let’s me continue throughout my day. I only use around 10-15 a month and haven’t had a single issue with tolerance or abuse. If you take it when you need to, it will make the bad days good days. Highly recommend. It acts way longer than Xanax too, so that is a plus, you don’t have to re-dose every 3 hours. Highly recommend this benzodiazepine. Don’t take it daily, take it how you’re supposed to, and it will make life a lot easier to live with the conditions I have. Best of luck to all.",Matt

It was given to me for panic to take as needed. It does calm you quickly but at the highest price. Very real side effects include paranoia, fatigue, confusion, and impaired judgement. I made several terrible terrible business decisions while taking it. But the worst side effects come when you stop it. For me zero sleep insomnia, chest pain, fatigue, muscle loss, emotional emptiness, and SUICIDAL thoughts/acts that go on and on.

21,Clonazepam,Panic Disorder,10.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"November 14, 2021",2,"This medication saved my life. After suddenly suffering from extreme out of the blue panic attacks, which led me into a constant state of anxiety - afraid of having another one, afraid I was dying with some terminal illness, afraid to drive, to go shopping, to go to work, to be left alone because I thought I was going to have another attack. My attacks started suddenly while driving one day. I thought I was having a stroke and the medical work ups I had done and the amount of trips to the ER I was diagnosed with panic disorder/agoraphobic. I lost 20lbs in one month. At first I tried an SSRI but that made me 1000 times worse to the point I was manic and couldn’t sleep felt like I was on speed and things just got worse. I stopped the SSRI and refused to try another one.

22,Clonazepam,Panic Disorder,10.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"November 12, 2021",2,"Klonopin (clonazepam):I'm prescribed to no take  more than 1mg per day as needed. Typically I take between 0 and 4mg per WEEK. Been on it for almost a year now. Taking it in this way has yielded zero negative results. I never get withdrawal symptoms the weeks and (on a very rare lucky month) I don't take it. At this dose, combined with the Effexor and Trazadone..... it's enough to end any panic attack within about 1 hour tops. I literally only take it when I have panic attacks. If you suffer from panic/anxiety and are OK using this only when you feel you really need it, it's a pretty good med. I don't doubt that those who are on ridiculous doses like 3MG+ per day will have withdrawal issues, as this IS a benzo after all. It also helps with my Autism symptomsI'd say this drug is excellent if all you need is a once-twice weekly emergency med.

23,Clonazepam,Panic Disorder,9.0,Taken for 10 years or more,"November 6, 2021",4,"I started taking clonazepam after witnessing a death in 1990.  I spent most of 1990 and 1991 a zombie state with daily panic attacks and no amount of CBT or psychological help could help me snap out of it.  I fell behind in school and a small daily dose of clonazepam allowed me to function again and focus on tasks. I managed to pull my life back together and I have taken a low dose on and off over the past 30 years.  Although I believe it causes dependence and can be abused I also know that when it’s well managed that it is hugely beneficial.  There is definitely a social stigma and the current generation of doctors have been trained to prescribe SSRI’s, which I’ve never felt had any positive effect, and nudge patients away from this medication.  It is very difficult to get prescribed whenever my doctor changes, however it is the only medication, including numerous supplements I’ve tried, that truly reduces my anxiety to the point I am able to work and be productive.",Very Helpful

443,Clonazepam,Panic Disorder,10.0,,"April 29, 2008",27,"Klonopin (Clonazepam) is incredible! It saved my life after I took Xanax (Alprazolam)! It was too short-acting. I take 4 - 1mg tablets a day for my Chronic MAJOR Panic Disorder. I also take 1 30mg Restoril (Temazepam) Capsule at bedtime. All of the benzodiazepines work well, but Clonazepam is the safest, most effective, and a real lifesaver! Antidepressants and Herbals did nothing. Clonazepam is ""Oldschool"", so it's tried and true! IT WORKS! Better than any other anti-anxiety drug! AMAZING!",Doctor Kyle

However, after using it occasionally for 2 years, I feel I am a little emotionally dependent on it. If I'm out of these pills, I feel nervous. I would recommend using this pill only when in panic or anxiety and also learning other coping strategies, such as regular exercise, meditation, self-talk, yoga, crafts & artwork or something fun & productive, or a relaxing bubble bath!!!",happy chick
