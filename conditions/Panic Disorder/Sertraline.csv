Your comments really helped me to even start taking it so thanks to everyone that left a review because I’m scared of medicine. I am to leave a review in hopes to help someone like me! I started on 25mg but broke it in half to get it into my system for one week and I will move up to my 25mg but my experience so far I have had sleepless nights, headaches, diarrhea, not really been hungry but y’all don’t let that scare you like it did me.  I’m telling you even on a small dose I can tell a small adjustment already and I will be back in another week to update y’all on the dose increase, but take a leap of faith and try it I can already tell I’m feeling some what better just in a week! We are all in this together!",Renee
1,Sertraline,Panic Disorder,10.0,Taken for 5 to 10 years,"March 24, 2022",2,"Zoloft (sertraline):It's a mystery to me why anyone would be afraid to take antidepressants. Well actually no, it's not a mystery. I'm sure it's because of all the sensationalism in the media. It's a good example of what a grave disservice the media can do the public. Mental health medicine is no different from other medicines. This one treats depression. That's why it's called an                  ""anti"" ""depressant"". What's less well known is that antidepressants usually treat anxiety as well, including panic attacks. Actually, most antidepressants are some of the safest medicines on the market. Zoloft saved my life. It made a dark gloomy depression just disappear. I felt like a huge burden had been lifted off my shoulders.",Anonymous
2,Sertraline,Panic Disorder,9.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"March 21, 2022",2,"Out of the blue was having palpitations, chest and muscle tightness, trembling, no appetite and constant anxiety and panic. Preoccupation with breathing and hyper aware of everything along with sleep disturbances. Became agoraphobic. The first 2-3 weeks I started getting my appetite back and the trembling stopped - I had a hard time getting on it due to extreme nausea and dry heaving and continued anxiety/panic. Thank God I stuck with it after going from 25mg to a minimum therapeutic dose of 50mg- a full 12 weeks later I can eat and sleep and function. Went back to work and can drive again. Focus to read and do a puzzle and reason much better. Still have occasional off days but nothing compared to pre sertraline. I feel it was the best decision I made to continue even when it seemed I was STUCK in Panic/OCD/Anxiety mode. Thank God for my family and friends and Sertraline. Back to work now and able to enjoy my life much more. It’s not a magic wand but it was a life saver for me.",Anonymous
3,Sertraline,Panic Disorder,10.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"March 9, 2022",5,"Zoloft (sertraline):I have had panic disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, OCD, and depression. I have struggled with anxiety since I was a child. I have been in therapy since I was young, have done CBT and seen my therapist regularly. I have done all of the things that I was supposed to do. Exercise, healthy eating, sunlight, sleep, etc... I developed an intense fear of not sleeping. Literally it consumed all of me. I was insanely depressed because I was mentally exhausted from the anxiety and obsession I developed about sleep. I was able to get through it without medication but it took time and it was very hard. It happened again out of nowhere, nothing triggered me.  That's when I realized I needed medication as I clearly have some time of imbalance in my brain and this isn't my fault nor something I can control. I have been taking 50 mg of Zoloft for 5 weeks now and have improved drastically. I literally have stopped caring about the sleep. Do not give up. Do not let the negative reviews deter you.",Anna

I was so hesitant about going on medication for my anxiety but I’m so happy I did. The beginning stages as you are getting used to the medication are rough i won’t lie. But once you get past those 2-3 weeks it’s like a breath of fresh air. I was having panic attacks every day all day long, now I can function normally again and love the life I live :)",natalie

6,Sertraline,Panic Disorder,10.0,,"March 1, 2022",3,"After 6 months of constant panic attacks due to PTSD, I turned to my last resort, sertraline. I was prescribed these tablets after a horrendous Christmas eve and the list of side effects left me crying. Terrified of the increased anxiety I would face within the first weeks of taking them. My first two nights on these tablets were HORRIFIC! Throwing up, racing heart rate, severe dizziness (almost a drunk  feeling), intense flashbacks. This is normal! I had 4 weeks of mild side effects after two horrific nights … 4 weeks of feeling lightheaded, extreme tiredness and hot flushes. I am on my 7th week of the tablets and all my side effects have gone and I feel AMAZING! I cannot remember the last time I had a panic attack ! I’m planning trips to festivals, shopping centres, London, all things I never would have dreamed of doing! PLEASE STICK WITH THEM! They are your ticket to getting your life back!

7,Sertraline,Panic Disorder,9.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"February 27, 2022",2,"Zoloft (sertraline):I started taking Zoloft about 3 years ago and yes, the first 4 weeks were hard Increased anxiety, insomnia, sweaty hands, headache and nausea, eventually went away, the last one to go was insomnia. After about 6 months we added welbutrin to counteract the procrastination that Zoloft caused. During the period of having the side effects I went back to the Doctor several times and following helped:1) Valium to help ease the initial increase in anxiety2) First Valium to help overcome the insomnia, but did not help, so put on trazodone.3) Going to the gym and having a good 30 minute intense aerobic exercise session (had to take valium first, so anxiety went down and I had motivation to go)Zoloft comes with side effects, if you get them, go back to your Doctor and get meds to ease the side effects. Don't continue to suffer. I came off Zoloft and recently started it again. Made sure I got prescription for Trazadone and Valium. Week 3 and side effects have been well managed",Rob

I posted a while back, but wanted to check in after about 8 months. Only 50 mg daily. My anxiety  has basically completely subsided. The only continuing side effect that I seem to have is a deep afternoon tiredness, to the point that I have to take a nap nearly every day now.  I still have some depression, and some days I can get pretty dour. My doctor prescribed Wellbutrin to me today. I'll be combining it with my Zoloft to try to offset some of the fatigue and help with the doldrums. If not for the tiredness, I would give zoloft 10 out of 10. It eliminated my anxiety.",judonerd

My vision was blurry, I couldn't stand up straight, I lost 25lbs from nausea and apathy, I was emotionally a zombie, I couldn't smile to my kids,  I developed such a deep depression that I checked myself into inpatient.  Drs tried to stabilize me back at 50mg but the depression wouldn't lift. I have been off it for 2 weeks now.  I'm scared I'll never find my normal again, but I feel so much better than I did on it.

10,Sertraline,Panic Disorder,5.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"February 15, 2022",0,"Zoloft (sertraline):Worked well to quiet my obsessive thoughts and panic attacks but unfortunately the side effects turned out to be worse than my mental disorders. I started having migraines almost immediately, memory loss, scattered thoughts, extremely dry eyes and nightly teeth clenching so bad I had to start wearing a night guard. I actually spent 2 years looking for other reasons with multiple doctors for these ailments but in the end they were all caused by the Zoloft. I finally quit taking it and one by one all these ailments disappeared. I think this is a good drug, it did what it was supposed to do and might work wonders for others, definitely give it a try But if you start having issues like me, don’t suffer for years like I did.

13,Sertraline,Panic Disorder,10.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"February 5, 2022",1,"I had a terrible experience at first, but I pushed on, and I'm so glad I did. I really, really, really recommend this medication. I would call it the 'not caring drug'. My physical symptoms of anxiety disappeared over time, and as an effect, so did my obsessive anxious thoughts. If I get anxious now, I just don't care, and it fizzles away like magic.The very first time I took it, I started off with one pill of 25mg. It gave me the worst panic attack of my life that same day. But in hindsight, if I had known it would've been that bad, I wouldn't have panicked as much. I recommend using Claire Weekes' acceptance techniques.I didn't give up and a few weeks later, I tried again. The psychiatrist made me build up by amounts of 12,5mg per week this time, so I end up with 50mg in the 4th week, plus a benzo every day while building up. I also started having physical exercise, now I'm back to 90% of my original functioning. I'm so glad I took this path when nothing else worked.",Swift

I'm a 21 year old male and started Zoloft about 3 months ago after being on Remeron for 4 years for GAD and Panic Disorder. I had no appetite, lost 20 pounds in about 2 weeks, throwing up twice a day, multiple panic attacks, and was in a dark place. My doctor suggested I try Zoloft to which I reluctantly agreed. I was titrated up to 150mg in about a week. My first week was awful. It peaked my anxiety, I felt extremely tense, racing thoughts, nausea, pacing around etc. 2nd week I felt extremely numb, emotionless, and just out of it. My least favorite side effect was brain fog. 8 weeks later and I felt amazing, I'm back to my old self but a lot more confident and happy. My advice is don't look at your progress day to day but rather week to week you'll see the improvement. I came on here everyday my first few weeks looking for hope that things would get better and now they are. :)",:))

Everything got worse when I tried to go without the sleeping pills and spent 3 nights with no sleep and got up on the 4th day having panic attacks. The GP prescribed Sertraline (Zoloft) and more sleeping pills. I started 1 week 25mg, 2 week 50mg, 3 week 75 mg where I remain. The first 4 weeks were an absolute nightmare-Strong headaches, increased anxiety, I felt my brain burning!I definitely felt a lot worse than before and I don't think I would have made it through without this forum and the support of my husband. I started feeling a bit better after 6 weeks and now on the 9th week, I feel a lot better. I have gone 4 nights without zolpidem and sleeping fine, back to socializing and feeling normal.

One night while sleep I just woke up heart racing chest tight, I was having a full blown panic attack that felt like I was having a heart attack! Ended up going to the hospital, my blood pressure was up along with palpitations when I arrived. My heart was checked my blood everything all came back normal…I was so confused and felt defeated. I made a follow up appointment with my doctor who prescribed me Zoloft, so far I have taken it one time and have had it for 2 weeks. I am so afraid of my panic attacks increasing while on this from the reviews I have read. Me taking the one dose that I did had me freaking out.

I tried everything natural (meditation, lemon balm, exercise, no caffeine, etc..) and Zoloft has been the only successful remedy! While the first 3-4 weeks are uncomfortable (inability to orgasm, nausea, worsened anxiety), all those side effects go away! It's sooo worth it to stick it out.

I am sorry, but Wellbutrin isn't the pill of choice for anxiety.  I was on it 6 days and I have been without sleep for 3 nights in a row and have lost my appetite today.  My heart pounded constantly and my body would never settle down.  I am having intrusive thoughts (one song keeps looping in my head).  I had several panic attacks in the last few days after stopping it.  I made the decision to go back to my old faithful, Zoloft.  I got off of it July, due to weight gain, after having been on it twice within 8 years.  I gained about 10 or 12 pounds from it.  At this point, I don't care about the weight gain!  I want sleep, a calmer spirit, and peace of mind.  Zoloft did give me diarrhea this morning and made me nauseous, something that I did not experience the first two times taking the meds.

The sensations and feelings  would last a day or two, and would go away (happened three different times). Then in early October it happened, and didn't go away. My doctor prescribed by 50 mg of Zoloft (once a day) and the lowest dose of Xanax (as needed). The first week of Zoloft was a nightmare. The anxiety was at all time high, no appetite, dry mouth, diarrhea, and couldn't sleep. The Xanax was able to take the edge off a little bit. If I didn't have the Xanax, I probably would have stopped taking the Zoloft. After 10 days, things became a little less intense. I was able to eat, anxiety was still present but at a much lower level, and stomach issues were no longer. About 5-6 weeks later I noticed that I am back to almost 100% anxiety free.

I did not really have too bad of effects, just a little nausea the first few weeks, and insomnia the first few months. Occasional night sweats depend on if I mess with my dosage but it's manageable. I feel more balanced and I am not as prone to panic attacks or just anxiety in general. I still get a healthy amount of anxiety as some days can be better than others but it's not crippling.

I really did not like the side effects so I switched to 25 mg and took it at night before bed. The first week sucked but the anxiety really went away. I'm on week 5 now. Last week I went back up to the 50 mg. I feel great! I feel like my old self again. My heart rates down and I have had no panic attacks at all! My husband and daughter are so happy. Side effects suck but they do get better! I promised myself to write a review because the others help me get through that first week. It was scary but Im so grateful.",Samantha

I was diagnosed as having PMDD (Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder) with underlying depression. I was terrified of taking medication; I thought I would be suppressing the True Me. I was wrong. Taking Sertraline was the best decision ever. I am more myself than ever: I've happy and balanced. My husband and friends say I'm a new person. I used to be overwhelmed my emotions. I was always on the verge of tears. I would avoid social situations and conflicts for fear of breaking down and crying. I would obsess on things and throw all out temper tantrums.

And believe me my life is better than I could have ever imagined. I haven't had a panic attack since I started on Zoloft.

Around day 12 I started to notice the positives from this medication.  Clouds began to part and every day it improves. Still struggling to sleep more than 5 hours but I nap when I can.

Side effects for the first two weeks: loose stool and stomach ache, and to counteract this I would eat and the problem goes away. I switched to taking my Zoloft at night to avoid being tired in the morning. I am sometimes slightly nauseated at times, but I am telling you it is totally manageable and worth it compared to how calm and more together I feel. My emotions are still intact. I have way less panic when saying things on my mind and feel less shaky inside. I hope this helps and this is more common than you think.",bailey1111116

After that I took 12.5mg Sertraline everyday (always with combination with 10mg escitalopram) and continue to increase the dose in steps of 12.5mg every 10 days up to a dose of 50mg. Now I’m on 50mg of Sertraline plus 10mg of escitalopram and things are good.  There were only 2 days were problems with anxiety occurred and when this happened I took 12.5mg sertraline less the next day and increased again the dose the next day.",UK-London

110,Sertraline,Panic Disorder,1.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"February 2, 2020",3,I found sertraline an atrocious horrible drug that made me worse. Originally went to the doctors as had been a bit panicky over Christmas. Was put on this and made me feel awful from day 1 that continued few days later had to go to A&E during the night then again a week or so later. Also a few more visits to the doctors was always told keep taking it. After 4/5 weeks of feeling terrible thought no more. As it was making me very very anxious with stupid horrible thoughts that were scary also made me very down and I normally love life. So went to the doctors and said cannot take anymore of this and got off it and changed. 3 days of not taking it already feeling better now I’m not taking that nasty pill everyday day. Taking that sertraline was one of the worst few weeks of my life.,BC

It took away intrusive morbid thoughts (PTSD, OCD, anxiety) that had plagued me daily. Also, my general anxiety of feeling time pressured all the time. I am now up to 150mg, increased to 200mg one week out of the month (ya know, that time of the month). These days, my PTSD is mostly under control, but depression has popped up, and now panic attacks again. I'm still giving an 8 out of 10, because  of a 5 year run on a psyche med complimenting your body chemistry is expected. But I dont like the brain zaps I get when I'm late taking it.

I was prescribed 50mg Sertraline which literally resulted in the continuation of the panic attacks for the first week of use. It was tough. I felt as if I was losing my mind and with it my life. That said, after sticking it through and combating anxiety with frequent running and meditation, Setraline started to get to work. By week 3, I felt myself. However, I made the mistake of using my improved disposition to begin drinking alcohol & taking tramadol for chronic back pain. In week 4 it backfired and I was having anxiety attacks as bad as before. I've since dropped the tramadol & alcohol and will be running on Sertraline again as I should have",RJC

Earlier this year I began having SEVERE panic attacks that landed me in the ER. The first week on 25mg was really hard, I had a very upset stomach, diarrhea, and increased anxiety. The side effects started to lessen after that, only to start back up all over again when I went up to 50mg. Those side effects only lasted about a week again, but I didn’t get a good nights sleep for about a month after starting 50mg. It was awful. But that has also now passed and I can truly say that I feel better than ever entering month 3. The one side effect that I think is here to stay unfortunately is the sexual side effect. However I have none to very minimal anxiety, NO panic attacks. I feel back to my normal self. This is a medication that you definitely have to ride out the storm in order to get to the positives. It helps going into it knowing that it’s going to be hard, but it’s worth the outcome!",Shannon

Trust me you may be skeptical but these medications work miles better for anxiety than they do for depression, I am less prone to feeling side effects as the only I experienced were sexual side effects but at the end of the day when anxiety is that bad its a small price to pay to have your life back:) 'No sacrifice No victory'",razor1234r

Shopping centres, tubes, rush hour, motorways and waking up hungover without having a panic attack. I can finally live life.

I stopped all the things I used to enjoy I didn't go to the gym and I wasn't physically active. I felt safe in my room not socialising as this did not cause me to panic. However it was a downward spiral from there. The reason that I felt safe at first was because my anxiety was from my heart beating fast and I was always aware of it ( weird right.) I wanted to avoid all things that would trigger my panic attacks. gotta cut it short so I took 50 mg zoloft and after the first day I haven't had one single panic attack and feel 10x better.

I felt like a robot going through the motions. I became very lazy (I am a go-go-go person. Never have I been lazy in my life) and it negatively affected my relationships with my husband and kids.

Like many, I read the reviews and was afraid to take it, but having established a good connection with my physician and trusting her judgment, I decided to try it out for a few months. We gradually stepped up the dosage, and I am now on 150mg. It really does work wonders for me. I used to worry constantly and was very irrational about some of these worries. I had severe anxiety over my job, and it was starting to reflect negatively in my performance. Now that I am on Zoloft, I feel much more even-keeled, and I don't seem to ever be too worried about anything. I can have rational thoughts about things that concern me. It doesn't work for everyone, but it's worth a shot if you suffer from anxiety.",Anonymous

Strangely my mom is on citalopram and copes really well (she has depression without anxiety). My psychiatrist recommended a switch to Zoloft and everything improved drastically. My symptoms of anxiety subsided dramatically and I can now continue with my life as normal. I still get mild panic attacks, but very rarely or when I get very upset.
