I do agree that it does work for the anxiety, but the side effects for me are personally not worth it. I started seeing shadows, had really bad anger outbursts, and really bad heart problems. Not to mention the brain fog whenever I would take a dosage. It was just too much to handle. Probably one of the worst meds I've ever taken.",Avoidance

I do not recommend taking this drug.",Nicole
3,Buspar,Panic Disorder,9.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"October 24, 2021",3,"Buspar holds a really special place in my heart. It was the first psych med I tried that worked for my anxiety and didn’t give horrendous side effects like all the antidepressants I tried. I took buspar for several months after my first bipolar depressive breakdown and it held me over while docs figured out my diagnosis and got me on mood stabilizers, which took many months. I was on the highest dose, split into 3 or 4x a day. The fact that it helped hold me over while I cycled through manic and depressive episodes says a lot. It started working almost immediately. It definitely was a bandaid medicine and I was still pretty rocky with my mood swings, but I’m grateful. It calmed me down and lifted the depression a bit. Only downside is that the effects wore off every 4 hours. I was able to stop taking it once my bipolar meds got figured out but if I ever hit a rough patch with anxiety I'd go back on it in a heart beat.",CBI
4,Buspar,Panic Disorder,10.0,Taken for 10 years or more,"October 15, 2021",5,"I've been taking buspirone HCL on and off for the last 15 years. Before that I was taking Valium or Xanax, back in the days when it was easy to get. I really enjoy the benzodiazepines, but admittedly, too much. With BuSpar I do get light headed and a mild mini-anxiety attack about 10 minutes after taking 15mg twice a day with possible related weight gain, but it works well.  I usually stop after a few months of feeling better and adjusting to life's changes:  divorce, wrongful imprisonment, parents death, and now losing my son. I also took lithium and anti-depressants in the past, but to be honest, I don't mind depression and I kind of enjoy my mania, but shortness of breath, the feeling of impending doom, and now heart palpitations are never pleasant. I take it until the discomfort of the side effects outweigh my current state, and I start up again when the side effects are nothing compared to what I feel. Maybe 3 months at a time, maybe 6. It kicks in right away, for me.",kcal58

6,Buspar,Panic Disorder,2.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"September 25, 2021",2,"I have panic disorder and anxiety issues. I currently take buspar and for some reason every now and then I get brain zaps or an electrical shock feeling from my head to the tips of my fingers. It's a very strange sensation. It wears off after about an hour or so. I've been on it for almost 3 weeks and I take 15 mg 3x a day like every 4 hours. When I first started taking it, it was just numbness and tingling in my hands. I thought it would eventually stop but no it's almost every other time I take it. It is comparable to brain zap withdrawals from Effexor or Paxil (antidepressants). I still have anxiety and on the edge of panic so I don't think it is actually helping me at all. And I also get numbness in my inner calf muscles which is weird. I can't feel my skin when I touch my legs or shave",Nikki
7,Buspar,Panic Disorder,10.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"September 14, 2021",5,"About a few years ago I started having such bad anxiety I couldn’t eat, couldn’t sleep, would be so anxious every night I’d become nauseous. I had trips to the emergency room to calm myself down because it was so terrible. Then I started taking the combination of lexapro and Buspar and no anxiety attacks and amazing sleep now it changed my life seriously. My anxiety was making it hard to live everyday normal life. Thank gosh for Buspar!!! No side effects either!",Malia
8,Buspar,Panic Disorder,9.0,,"August 13, 2021",9,"I have gotten to the point where I felt like I wouldn't survive my anxiety. My doctor put me 10 mg twice a day. I was hesitant to take it, because it's not a benzo, I didn't think it could help my severe anxiety, and I didn't think I could handle the despair from another failed medication. I've been on it for about a week and I felt relief from day 1. So far there have been no bad side effects. I am able to eat again. I still am not sleeping well but I am at least able to lie down and relax. Before, I was lying down with my heart pounding, racing thoughts, overwhelmed by fear, just waiting for the sun to rise. Buspar, in my opinion, works better than benzos. Because it gets me to a place where I don't need to take them to begin with. I still get mildly triggered but it goes away as quickly as it starts. I am very surprised at it's effectiveness. The only real side effect I've noticed is chronic snacking. Which is good for now as I had lost 30lbs due to my anxiety. Give it a chance.",Today can be a good day

I took it for 3 months on all different sorts of doses, 5mg-15mg and it did NOTHING to help my anxiety/panic. Complete placebo pill. What it did give me was, tremors, dizzyness, noise sensitivity, disassociation and made me angry BEYOND belief. Waste of time. If you do want to try to try it, take it 2-3 hours before you actually have to go to work or accomplish something, bc it makes you feel like rubbish for that long after you take your dose.

Based on my experience, for it’s effectiveness in managing panic disorder I can only give it a 3/10. If I had GAD the score might be different.

I went through tests and doctors trying to figure out what was wrong with me when all of them agreed I was having anxiety that was even causing most of my physical symptoms, shortness of breath, chest tightness, which then led to panic attacks as those symptoms match up with what we're being told are symptoms of the new virus.Finally after multiple appointments I was given Buspar and was told to give it a shot. It didn't work immediately and for the first week I'd say I didn't notice much and it had bummed me out, STICK WITH IT.  I'm on day 9 now I'd say and I finally feel like my old self.

I ended up with severe heart palpitations,  dizziness,  lightheadedness, nausea and feeling like I was going to pass out, in addition to my blood pressure being raised. I ended up on a heart monitor, seeing a cardiologist, in addition to other heart related tests all because my therapist is dead set on taking me off klonopin. I've been on 1mg of klonopin since 2008 and take it only as needed, mostly once a panic attack begins. I will never take BuSpar again, as I have been off of it now for about a week after all those symptoms and they are almost all gone now.

50,Buspar,Panic Disorder,9.0,,"May 15, 2014",179,"I have only been taking BuSpar for about a month but I have seen a rapid turn around in my anxiety. I am not cured, I still get panicked from time to time, but I am now able to deal my worries without getting lost in them. I used to go about life in a sort of depersonalized haze, but the medication has worked in bringing me back to reality. As for side effects, I think it is safe to say that I got them all in the first couple weeks. Nausea, dizziness, drowsiness, slight depression, etc... However, it was nothing that was too bad. As I continued to take it, the side effects decreased. Furthermore, the benefits that I have obtained from it far outweighed any complaints that I might have had. I would suggest trying it for anxiety.",InsertNameHere
51,Buspar,Panic Disorder,10.0,,"April 19, 2014",169,"I first had a panic attack last June & went to the hospital. They gave me Ativan 1mg. I took that for about 1 month and felt sort of out of it, so I decided to only take half and see how that worked. It did work, but I still felt like a zombie. I went back to the doctor & was prescribed BuSpar 5mg twice a day. I took that for three months, but was still having issues waiting in lines, being in public places & sometimes driving. I found I still needed to take the Ativan when I started to panic. Long and short the 5 mg 2xday would take away about 60% of my anxiety and I would force myself out of my head, so to speak. Recently I went back to the doctor & she upped my dose to 7.5 mg twice a day. I feel great! This is giving me my life back, NO more Ativan.",Cyndie1

Was put on a lot of meds before I tried Buspar.  I believe it with the addition of an SSRI antidepressant saved my life.  Back in August of this year I stopped everything and all my anxiety and panic and depression came back.  I started the Buspar again yesterday after a huge break down, slept better than I have in months, had great dreams, actually WANTED to get out of bed and today I feel better than I have since the summer! It may not work well for EVERYONE, but when it DOES work, it's amazing.",Anonymous

It made me so dizzy every time I took it that I couldn't even read a book because it felt like I was in a washing machine being twirled around. I took it at night before bed and I had to make sure I was in bed when I took it and I could not be walking around or doing anything because I was afraid I'd stumble or fall down. I took it for eight days and it didn't get any better, so finally I stopped taking it. It had no noticeable improvement on my anxiety anyway and I didn't see the point in taking something that made me feel like I was on a merry-go-round.",clarkdaniels

The attacks have been so severe that I cannot drive and was missing work.  I cannot take SSRI's or any medications for that matter.  My DR. prescribed Burspar 5mg twice daily.  That actually was too much for me and I take 2.5mg twice a day and it works wonderful.  I feel the anxiety dwindle away within 1 hour of taking the pill.  I do not take it on a regular basis, only when my anxiety begins to increase.  Buspar levels me to a normal level. There is hope.",Anonymous

I have a 1 year old and I couldn't take care of her that day. I had to call an on call doctor 4 times that night, call my psychologist, and I was told to skip my night time dose.

I am not a big medicine advocate because I just don't like the side effects of most like Seroquel (ugh) which gave me chills. I have had BIPOLAR, POST TRAUMATIC STRESS DISORDER, PANIC AND ANXIETY DISORDER since I was very young. I have tried so many medicines and none have gave me benefits like this one. I take 7.5 twice a day and I can go on with my daily functions on the normal level now. at first it made me a little reluctant due to the fact that I panic. It gave me a small euphoric moment but I was able to concentrate on my home work assignment which I could not do at before.",diamondlegacy

This medicine has gotten me through the separation of me and my mother, school phobia (a real thing: kind of a mix between agoraphobia and truancy), and generalized anxiety. I gave it an 8/10 because it takes about a month before the full potential results kick in. Also, it gives a sedative feeling when you take one, which always relaxes me.",J Rock

63,Buspar,Panic Disorder,3.0,,"August 17, 2011",26,"I used to take Paxil and I hated the side effects, and the withdrawal effects, like brain zaps.  Because of this, I don't want to try another SSRI. So my doctor had me try Buspar.  I was hopeful at first. I knew it affected serotonin, but without the withdrawal effects.  Well.  The first 5 mg dose I took brought on a gigantic round on brain zaps for 1.5 hours, the same kind that I'd had in Paxil withdrawal, but much worse. It was so bad that I could barely walk.  Every time I moved my head or neck, I'd get a bunch of zaps in a row.  Very disorienting.  I gave it a week and a half to see if the zaps would dissipate, and they didn't.  My doctor said to stop the Buspar because if the zaps haven't stopped by now, they probably won't.",EllenEllen

Every now and then I'll take an Ativan (.25mg) to augment the BuSpar, but I know I get the most relief from the BuSpar. Before taking this, I would have uncontrollable thoughts and fears that made me feel like I was going crazy and couldn't stop them. Now, I'm able to rationalize them and get them out of my head much easier. I definitely recommend this medicine to anyone with severe panic and anxiety problems.",DesertGuy
