0,Fluvoxamine,Panic Disorder,3,Taken for less than 1 month,"January 1, 2022",0,"Been using it for 3-4 days in 25 mg doses as recommended by my psychiatrist. From day one had lots of side effects, like: upset stomach, dry mouth, no appetite, very awful and heavy emotional feeling, feeling disconnected from my personality or emotions, very messy, uncontrollable thoughts, insane insomnia, where I can't sleep at all or if somehow I manage to do it, I wake up in the middle of the night, completely for no reason and have these massive panic attacks where it seems that even Xanax doesn't help and all I can think is that I have to get to ER asap. Despite all these side effects, for a couple of days I could feel like a normal person again, not having constant anxiety or panic attacks.",Tomaso
1,Fluvoxamine,Panic Disorder,9,,"May 27, 2021",2,"I suffer from severe panic disorder, no depression or mood imbalance, just panic disorder - I would wake up having severe panic attacks and would continue to have them throughout the day (always based around a fear of having a heart attack). It crippled my life.Luvox has helped me immensely in near eliminating all panic attacks and when panic and anxiety does start to rise (or I get chest or body sensations which previously would just about always trigger a severe panic attack). The Luvox almost always nips things in the bud and helps me quickly rationalise the situation and move on. On the rare occasion now that I do still experience panic it’s much much less severe. The sexual side effects for me aren’t as severe as Lexapro but only ‘just’. I one day hope my situation is that I find something without then sexual side effects but right now Luvox is absolutely necessary for me. If it weren’t for the sexual side effects I’d score it a 10.",Anonymous80
2,Fluvoxamine,Panic Disorder,6,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"December 11, 2019",4,"Hi all, I took this drug for 5 months after switching from sertraline. At first I took a way too high dose and became less vigilant at work so lowered it down. I did not improve my panic attacks as much as sertraline did but it did change my brain in that I stopped obsessing over keeping the house clean and noticing cracks in the walls or parts of the house that needed painting. I would get particularly fussy about cleaning around the time of my period before fluvoxamine. I'd imagine it to work brilliantly for OCD. I was also able to go to my 10 year reunion - didn't care what people thought of me! I ended up going back on sertraline to have a baby.",law46773
3,Fluvoxamine,Panic Disorder,5,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"September 15, 2018",8,I have been taking fluvoxamine 150 mg for about 6 months now and it definitely helped my anxiety. I don’t have as many panic attacks as I used to and when I do they are not as severe. I’m definitely not as fixated on my anxiety. The biggest side effect is that I literally can’t pay attention to save my life. Especially detail oriented tasks- no way. Really enjoying not having such bad anxiety but i feel like new inability to pay attention is getting in the way of me being able to do my job and reach my goals.,Michael
4,Fluvoxamine,Panic Disorder,10,Taken for 10 years or more,"March 7, 2018",17,"This has been the only medication that has worked for me. I was debilitated for two years with obsessive thoughts and severe panic attacks.I have now been on this medication for 23 years and it is still working for me.My 20 year old daughter is on it with success as well as my grandmother was on it as well.Don’t let other people’s comments make you second guess about trying this medication. Everyone is different, this pill is definitely worth trying.",Becca
