0,Nortriptyline,Panic Disorder,7,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"November 22, 2021",1,I was having terrible panic attacks first year after having a baby. Unable to sleep as well as migraines. I have tried almost every other anxiety and depression med out there. This helped with my panic attacks and migraines after about three weeks. I can actually sleep now too. Downsides are I’m hungry a lot more and have gained some weight. But I actually needed to gain some back. Also I my acid reflux has increased like crazy. I was hoping it would go away after awhile but I’ve been on 25mg now for five months. I’m on omeprazole already but about half hour after taking the nortriptyline my chest burns like crazy. Love this medicine so far but not sure I can deal with this acid.,Sabgirl

2,Nortriptyline,Panic Disorder,10,Taken for 5 to 10 years,"September 26, 2019",39,This medicine nortriptyline saved my life. Back in 2013  I woke up with panic attacks and anxiety through the roof. I had to end up going on disability twice and none of the regular depressants/anxiety medications would help. Found an amazing psychiatrist who put me on this life-changing medication. I am on 125 mg a day and it completely got rid of my anxiety and depression. No more panic attacks. I do take Ativan just in case I feel the anxiety coming on strong however the nortriptyline really helps control it. I recommend this medication to anybody with anxiety/panic/depression. You do need to give it time. The first time I was on it within two months I was cured I did get off it for a while to see if I needed it and I sure did. When  I got back on it the second time it took six months to work. Be patient.,Janine
3,Nortriptyline,Panic Disorder,10,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"June 6, 2019",29,"My doctor prescribed me nortriptyline for nerve pain and anxiety disorder about a month ago. I have been taking a dose of 25 mg once a day and after taking it for about 3 weeks I did notice betterment with the anxiety and panic issues, also less pain. I will continue to take it and see how it works in the longer term. I normally do NOT take pharma drugs but nothing else I tried has worked for me. So far so good on the nortriptyline..",Enigma
4,Nortriptyline,Panic Disorder,2,,"December 30, 2017",13,I was put on this medication for my anxiety and sleeping issues. This medication literally did nothing and they had me on 130 mg. It caused me to have very vivid dream and night sweats. I was on it for 3 years. I just stopped taking it and lost 25 pounds. I'm still losing weight. So who knows how much weight this medication actually made me gain.,MissWillow
5,Nortriptyline,Panic Disorder,10,,"August 13, 2015",69,"Had a few panic attacks, which later lead to constant panic attacks.  This caused Agoraphobia.  Suffered for 3 years and nortriptyline cured me from them 100%.  Stopped the Doom and the attacks.  I was on it 3 years and all was perfect.  Later, I tired many SSRI's and all on them seemed to induce or create panic attacks.  When I stopped the SSR's they went away.  I have been free from Panic attacks since.  It has now been 10 years clear.  Thank you nortriptyline..",Rob B Rob B
6,Nortriptyline,Panic Disorder,9,,"February 21, 2012",121,"Have had GAD (Anxiety, sometime severe) on and off for about 12 years.  I'm a 58 year old Male in excellent health, otherwise.  Nortriptyline was the 7th Med prescribed (after Lexapro, Beta Blockers, Zoloft, etc.) and for me it was radically better than all the other Meds.  Tried to take at night but was too activating.  Started taking 10 mg in the AM and another 10 mg in the afternoon (if needed).  Completely controlled my Anxiety, gave me more energy, improved sex drive, and cleared-up both Acne & Rosacea.  EXCELLENT Drug...worth a try.Due to the low dose, I had none of the typical side effects (dry mouth, etc.)","Seattle, WA"
7,Nortriptyline,Panic Disorder,10,,"April 28, 2011",210,Pamelor (nortriptyline):Pamelor works great for anxiety panic attacks. It calms you down and helps you to be able to think clearly to calm yourself down. You need to make sure that your doctor is giving you the proper mg amount for your panic attack disorder. I will not stop taking this. I highly recommend this for people to try.,brndtrftn
