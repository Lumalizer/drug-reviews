0,Buspirone,Panic Disorder,3.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"March 25, 2022",1,"I've been taking buspirone for 6 months and I can't say it has done too much. My anxiety is still crippling. Although it does help me sleep more regularly, and it takes some of the edge off Wellbutrin. Holy smokes though, do these pills ever taste terrible. The pill touches my tongue and my whole body recoils in disgust, and my whole being rejects it, making it very hard to swallow, which means it stays on my tongue longer, which means I have to taste it even longer. The ordeal feels like it lasts 5 years. This happens every time I take it. If you have any respect for yourself, do not take this medication without water. Though you can still taste it through the water. I really don't know if this medication is worth it. Though my friend is on it and she has seen improvements. Different strokes for different folks.",Dirdy Deeds
1,Buspirone,Panic Disorder,1.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"March 25, 2022",1,"Was prescribed this medication by the VA. I was on it for over a year. It made me feel dizzy, and nauseated the entire time. The worst part of this was trying to get off of it. The withdrawal was severe, despite being tapered off of it. My brain felt like it was being electrocuted, I would get intermittent  zaps for about 3 weeks after stopping the medication. My heart would race, I experienced sweating, couldn't sleep and had terrible nightmares.",Veteran
2,Buspirone,Panic Disorder,3.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"March 23, 2022",3,"BuSpar (buspirone):15mg twice a day, have been on this medication for about 3 years. I do agree that it does work for the anxiety, but the side effects for me are personally not worth it. I started seeing shadows, had really bad anger outbursts, and really bad heart problems. Not to mention the brain fog whenever I would take a dosage. It was just too much to handle. Probably one of the worst meds I've ever taken.",Avoidance
3,Buspirone,Panic Disorder,1.0,Taken for 5 to 10 years,"February 27, 2022",1,"This drug ruined my life.  I was on 15mg 3 times a day with lexapro 10mg for 5 years no problem.  Then my dr wanted to up the buspar to 30mg twice a day. Wound up in the ER with serotonin syndrome which was misdiagnosed as a panic attack.  They told me to take more ativan. I went back down to 15 mg and now it kept happening every time I take it. Rigid, stiff muscles, super high blood pressure severe confusion, insane intense fear, headache lasting for 4 hours every time I take it now. My doctor said he didn't know what to do and needed a week to reassess my situation.  He upped my ativan again, which I didn't take because I didn't want to mask whatever was happening.  After a week of not being able to function I called the pharmacist to see if there was a recall of buspar. She said no and asked my symptoms, I told her my symptoms and she says thats serotonin syndrome.  So I call my doctor to let him know and he said yeah lexapro and buspar shouldn't be taken together. What!",Rachel
4,Buspirone,Panic Disorder,1.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"February 5, 2022",1,"I was given this as part of a cocktail that my psychiatrist gave me since no other meds seemed to work either. She just wanted to keep increasing. I have emetophobia and each dose dose increase I'd have nausea and feel like rubbish. I stopped at 35mg a day. It didn't work at that dose at all and I wanted to remove the meds I am on since they just all combined make me feel worse.I can't recommend it since it didn't seem to work at all. I had no known side effects after the few weeks after the up doses, but also no benefits. Right now I am slowly going off at 5mg at a time. It is a med that works for some and doesn't work for the others. There was a potential for it to work if I went higher but I really did not want to.",newfiechic

6,Buspirone,Panic Disorder,1.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"December 30, 2021",1,"It provided ZERO efficacy for relief of my panic attacks.  It seems like a fairly weak drug.  If you have panic disorder, you are better suited going on an SSRI, like Sertraline.  The good news is that I experienced no withdrawal symptoms from discontinuing Buspirone.",drstockk
7,Buspirone,Panic Disorder,5.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"December 22, 2021",0,"I’ve suffered from panic attacks for over a decade before finally opting in for medication. My doctor started me on 10mg of Buspar per day as well as .25 Xanax to take as a last resort during the onset of a panic attack. I’ve had my dosage of the Busbar increase ever 2 months because for the 1st month it works great, but when the 2nd month hits, especially towards the end, the panic attacks start to come back. I had 2 panic attacks in 1 day both at work last week, the first one being one of the worst ones in a very long time. I explained this and as of today I’m now up to 60mg of Buspar a day. Overall this medication has helped but if it wasn’t for the Xanax safety net I’m not so sure if I’d feel this confident. I’m hoping after switching to the 60mg I can maintain that first month bliss for longer than a month.",Squill

9,Buspirone,Panic Disorder,9.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"October 24, 2021",3,"BuSpar (buspirone):Buspar holds a really special place in my heart. It was the first psych med I tried that worked for my anxiety and didn’t give horrendous side effects like all the antidepressants I tried. I took buspar for several months after my first bipolar depressive breakdown and it held me over while docs figured out my diagnosis and got me on mood stabilizers, which took many months. I was on the highest dose, split into 3 or 4x a day. The fact that it helped hold me over while I cycled through manic and depressive episodes says a lot. It started working almost immediately. It definitely was a bandaid medicine and I was still pretty rocky with my mood swings, but I’m grateful. It calmed me down and lifted the depression a bit. Only downside is that the effects wore off every 4 hours. I was able to stop taking it once my bipolar meds got figured out but if I ever hit a rough patch with anxiety I'd go back on it in a heart beat.",CBI

11,Buspirone,Panic Disorder,10.0,Taken for 10 years or more,"October 15, 2021",5,"BuSpar (buspirone):I've been taking buspirone HCL on and off for the last 15 years. Before that I was taking Valium or Xanax, back in the days when it was easy to get. I really enjoy the benzodiazepines, but admittedly, too much. With BuSpar I do get light headed and a mild mini-anxiety attack about 10 minutes after taking 15mg twice a day with possible related weight gain, but it works well.  I usually stop after a few months of feeling better and adjusting to life's changes:  divorce, wrongful imprisonment, parents death, and now losing my son. I also took lithium and anti-depressants in the past, but to be honest, I don't mind depression and I kind of enjoy my mania, but shortness of breath, the feeling of impending doom, and now heart palpitations are never pleasant. I take it until the discomfort of the side effects outweigh my current state, and I start up again when the side effects are nothing compared to what I feel. Maybe 3 months at a time, maybe 6. It kicks in right away, for me.",kcal58

13,Buspirone,Panic Disorder,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"October 7, 2021",6,"I have chronic PTSD, panic disorder, depression, and had been taking 80 mg of Prozac, 1 mg of Xanax, 30 mg of Temazepam at night. Just recently I changed Psychiatrists and was taken off of Xanax and put on Buspirone 15 mg two times a day. When I tell you that my life has changed for the better.... it is an understatement. I used to think I was living life when I got put on all my psych meds till I got on buspirone, now I am truly living and loving life to its fullest. I wake up and look forward to waking up and living, it is truly a blessing. My triggers are managed now, I do not have panic or anxiety attacks that lead me to depression and sheltering myself, now I am able to refocus and process my feelings and emotions and thoughts. Buspirone is AMAZING!! I would highly, highly suggest for a new protocol that requires every patient be put on Buspirone before being placed on Xanax - this is how much I love this new medication...

I currently take buspar and for some reason every now and then I get brain zaps or an electrical shock feeling from my head to the tips of my fingers. It's a very strange sensation. It wears off after about an hour or so. I've been on it for almost 3 weeks and I take 15 mg 3x a day like every 4 hours. When I first started taking it, it was just numbness and tingling in my hands. I thought it would eventually stop but no it's almost every other time I take it. It is comparable to brain zap withdrawals from Effexor or Paxil (antidepressants). I still have anxiety and on the edge of panic so I don't think it is actually helping me at all. And I also get numbness in my inner calf muscles which is weird. I can't feel my skin when I touch my legs or shave",Nikki

I had trips to the emergency room to calm myself down because it was so terrible.

17,Buspirone,Panic Disorder,9.0,,"August 13, 2021",9,"BuSpar (buspirone):I have gotten to the point where I felt like I wouldn't survive my anxiety. My doctor put me 10 mg twice a day. I was hesitant to take it, because it's not a benzo, I didn't think it could help my severe anxiety, and I didn't think I could handle the despair from another failed medication. I've been on it for about a week and I felt relief from day 1. So far there have been no bad side effects. I am able to eat again. I still am not sleeping well but I am at least able to lie down and relax. Before, I was lying down with my heart pounding, racing thoughts, overwhelmed by fear, just waiting for the sun to rise. Buspar, in my opinion, works better than benzos. Because it gets me to a place where I don't need to take them to begin with. I still get mildly triggered but it goes away as quickly as it starts. I am very surprised at it's effectiveness. The only real side effect I've noticed is chronic snacking. Which is good for now as I had lost 30lbs due to my anxiety.

It gives me horrible headaches, horrible insomnia,  and a really weird, sort of nauseated, sea sickish feeling about 2 hours after taking it.

I took it for 3 months on all different sorts of doses, 5mg-15mg and it did NOTHING to help my anxiety/panic. Complete placebo pill. What it did give me was, tremors, dizzyness, noise sensitivity, disassociation and made me angry BEYOND belief. Waste of time. If you do want to try to try it, take it 2-3 hours before you actually have to go to work or accomplish something, bc it makes you feel like rubbish for that long after you take your dose.

20,Buspirone,Panic Disorder,2.0,,"July 1, 2021",0,"I started taking this and after about and hour and a half I would start to feel very... odd. I didn’t understand it back then but I realize now it was causing me to disassociate. Then after an hour and a half of that along with blurry vision I would finally feel peace for a few hours and then it would stop and it would be time to take another one. Then at about four days the peace stopped coming and it was just constant disassociation and extreme nightmares which messed up my sleep, bad head aches and I was constantly tired. I had an 8 hour panic attack because I woke up to racing thoughts, I was in the weirdest negative mindset, that’s never happened to me before. I couldn’t stop crying & had to go into work like that! I quit after that. Buspirone made my anxiety even worse because of how distressing this week was for me this was the worst decision I made yet for my mental health.

My lorazepam was a very low dosage and used maybe every couple of months, I used it the day after I had to drive in the metroplex as that’s a trigger for me! The lorazepam calmed me back to my normal self. Buspirone was prescribed at 0.5mg twice a day.
