0,Propranolol,Panic Disorder,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"November 6, 2021",5,"I’ve been having panic attacks regularly in situations like, board meetings, trains, haircuts. As soon as I’m in a situation where I know it’s not ok to just leave I panic and have to fight the urge to escape, causing faintness and severe stress. With a new job coming up I needed help, I’ve taken propranalol now for three weeks, including giving a speech, countless meetings and I’ve had no symptoms. You still get the idea of a panic here we go feeling but it’s doesn’t come to anything and once you realise this you can relax and focus. I take only when I know I need it and the rest of the time I don’t use. Great drug!!",Richmondworrier
1,Propranolol,Panic Disorder,10.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"October 14, 2021",3,"I'd like to add my very positive experience with propranolol for long-term anxiety with no known cause except physical symptoms of sudden left chest tightness and an internal ""racing"" feeling that comes and goes (blood pressure and heart rate are normal when this happens). I have tried Zoloft and Lexapro and immediately did not like the side effects. This has been ongoing for 10 months and doctors (internist, cardiologist, endocrinologist, psychologist) don't have an answer to the cause except for anxiety. Because of the length of time these symptoms have been present, doctors would like me to be on a long-term SSRI/SNRI, but I do not like the idea of being on one of these medications and the side effects only seem to add to my anxiety. Propranolol (10 mg) as needed works within an hour and I normally end up taking 2-2 1/2 pills a day. The only other thing that works better is Ativan, but of course it is addictive and generally not prescribed long term.",RAL

3,Propranolol,Panic Disorder,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"August 25, 2021",14,"Propranolol is a game changing drug with a really safe side effect profile. It’s worth remembering, too, that the majority of people don’t experience side effects with any drugs and people tend to be more inclined to share negative experiences.I first tried propranolol a couple of years ago for panic disorder, and oh my days did it work. I felt SO relaxed. Yeah, the intrusive thoughts tried to push through and start the cycle of panic, but with no physical response for them to hang on to, they simply fizzled away. The cycle broke.I’m a bit of an anomaly in that I was unfortunate enough to experience a (very unlikely) interaction with fluoxetine which made my heart rate drop to below 40. (This was following taking two 40mg doses) Needless to say, I wasn’t allowed this drug anymore whilst taking the fluoxetine.Remember, you will likely not experience any side effects. I got unlucky - it happens.Please give this drug a try, it absolutely works.",JackTheLad
4,Propranolol,Panic Disorder,5.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"August 25, 2021",2,"Propranolol worked great for me! It was just what I needed when I could not manage my panic; however, I could not take this medication because after 5 days of taking it on an as needed basis, it made my psoriatic arthritis flair up super bad!! So big warning to anyone with psoriatic arthritis as beta-blockers can cause it flair up severely!! My psychiatrist knew I had this condition and did not warn me before hand. I felt awful for days and was covered in psoriasis until I looked online and found out propranolol can flair up my autoimmune problems. Such a disappointment as the medication worked pretty well. So warning to anyone with psoriasis/psoriatic arthritis, BE CAREFUL WITH THIS MED.",Pat
5,Propranolol,Panic Disorder,10.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"August 19, 2021",4,I have struggled with anxiety for quite awhile. It turned into random panic attacks that had me feeling like I was going to DIE and would ruin me every time it happened. After multiple ER trips and heart monitoring everything checked out ok. My doc started me on 60mg of the extended release  propranolol and it’s helped SO MUCH! Every once in awhile I’ll still get a breakthrough panic attack but it’s mild and doesn’t demolish my day like it use to. In the beginning I was more tired than usual but a few weeks in my body got use to it and I don’t even notice it anymore. I definitely recommend!!!,Fister920

I could hardly go to work, did hypnosis, went for walks in the middle of the night to fight the attack that would wake me out of my sleep.  By misdiagnosis of probable thyroid disease I was given Propranolol.  It took about 3 weeks for it helped with the panic.   This drug literally saved my life. I have been diagnosed with a severe general anxiety condition and I have been panic attack free.  I have been on this drug for approximately 20 years, and although Drs suggest this is far too long they decided to keep prescribing it as I have had no adverse reactions in this time frame.   To the makers, I thank them for this drug.",Canada

8,Propranolol,Panic Disorder,10.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"September 29, 2020",40,"Been taking propranolol for around 3 years it has worked wonders for my panic disorder I take it every morning at 10am at 40MG as soon as I've taken it I feel calmer and my anxiety, and  racing thoughts go away. I can control my anxiety attacks a lot better it takes away the racing heart rate associated with panic attacks. There are some common side effects of this medication these are drowsiness a slow heart rate and mild dizziness when you stand up but apart from that it has been very effective at dealing with my panic attacks. I highly recommend to people with anxiety issues or fears of going in for a job interview or on a air plain it works really well for these things",Rose1996

My panic disorder seems gone too, but it has a troublesome side effect for me like Acid Reflux on my stomach and a little bit of dizziness. For people that have medical history on Ulcer or GERD, I suggest you take this med with your Ulcer/GERD meds (like PPIs and Sucralfate).

I think it’s because I didn’t need an increase in serotonin so they gave me horrendous side effects. I found this webpage and asked my Dr to try propranolol as my most common symptoms were a raving heart and an intense adrenaline rush. It had been months of my fight or flight switch being turned on and this medication was able to switch it off. Along with meditation, deep breathing, and positive thinking...the anxiety is practically gone. I truly felt that I was going to be stuck feeling AWFUL for the rest of my life.

When I have a panic attack I start feeling terrified inside, then bad physical symptoms follow that makes me feel even more terrified.

16,Propranolol,Panic Disorder,9.0,,"April 27, 2020",72,"I’d suffered on and off with panic attacks for years, oftentimes worsened by prescriptions (particularly Citalopram). My doctor recommended I switch to Sertraline after regular panic resurfaced. but after such a bad experience with Citalopram I asked if there were any options besides antidepressants. I felt that my problems were oftentimes worsened by physical issues such as palpitations and shortness of breath (for example, running up some stairs too fast would obviously raise my heartbeat which I oftentimes struggled to differentiate from the beginnings of a panic attack and thus it would escalate into one) and my doctor suggested I try Propanolol. It has been a game changer for me. I feel more secure in the knowledge my heartbeat is more controlled (or at least it feels this way). I’ve been on this for over a year now and wouldn’t try anything else.  I would definitely recommend it if you experience panic attacks that are often triggered by more physical problems.",Hjm95

19,Propranolol,Panic Disorder,10.0,,"December 22, 2019",87,"Hi there I've been on propanolol  80mg for 2 years along with mirtazapine 15mg . On these two meds  I will say I feel absolutely amazing it stops my panic attacks like a cure and it help with stopping me thinking about the panic disorder. I used to get fast heart rate, hot flashes, turning stomach, thoughts racing  but not anymore. It's a miracle combo yippeee so yeh but it  works differently on different body's. It's how your body responds to the medication with me it slows my heart right down not dangerously low but low enough were I feel more relaxed but with energy I feel happier with a mild euphoria and my sweating goes away, my sweaty hands have stopped and the shivering has gone.

I was a crying, panicky mess! I was having to miss work. I was already on Lexapro 20mg daily and Buspar 30mg daily but they were no match for my hormones. At first the doc prescribed me propranolol 80mg, it was WAY too much! It knocked me out for hours. We tried it again starting with 10mg (the lowest dose) and worked our way up. 20mg daily is the magic dose for me. It helps so much! At first I had some stomach upset, but that only last a few weeks.

22,Propranolol,Panic Disorder,10.0,,"September 21, 2019",48,"I have had panic disorder my entire life, and racing heart never used to be one of my symptoms. About 23 years ago, when my mom was in the hospital. I had a horrible tachycardia attack with my heart racing over 240 bpm. I was in the hospital visiting my mom at the time, and they wrote it off as anxiety related. I have had benign tachycardia as a symptom ever since. When I'm anxious, my heart races and I cannot do anything. Getting on propranolol was the number one best thing I have done. I am also on a very low dose of xanax (two to three quarter mg's per day). I take three to four 10 mg tablets of propranolol, more as needed. If I have something difficult to do, or have to drive far I need more. But if my heart isn't racing, then I feel more comfortable doing things. If I didn't have it, I would be completely housebound agoraphobic like I was when I was 18.",dizzylizzy
23,Propranolol,Panic Disorder,8.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"May 30, 2019",22,I've been on 40mg propranolol twice a day for 2 days. It's eased off my anxiety so I can walk around and my legs aren't like jelly and also slowed my racing heart. Obviously this medicine does nothing for the mental effects of anxiety. It's definitely brought a calm over me.  Feel a bit woozy after taking the med's. Made me very tired but also given me insomnia. I can deal with all this just to get a sense of calm and be able to function normal.  If your doctor offers you this for anxiety please try it before you go down the benzo route.

24,Propranolol,Panic Disorder,9.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"April 8, 2019",49,My panic disorder often works this way.  I will just be sitting there and all of a sudden I feel a surge of adrenaline.  My brain starts worrying about the physical response to a surge of adrenaline which sets up a feedback loop during which my mind accentuates the physical response which heightens the mental fear which worsens the physical response and so on.  Propranolol does a very good job of blunting that type of attack in my case since there is nothing going on in my head to cause panic except for what is going on in my body.  It's not quite Xanax which doctors are increasingly unwilling to prescribe but it really does work to greatly lessen the physical component of a panic attack.,OriginalLHB
25,Propranolol,Panic Disorder,9.0,,"January 9, 2019",80,"After waking up with panic attacks more days than not lately, my doctor and I tried sertraline for a few months with no success.  I got a prescription for Ativan from the ER, which is a miracle drug, but obviously wanted something else for a long-term solution.  I asked my doctor what he thought about a beta blocker and he was onboard and gave me 60 mg of the extended release formula (the lowest extended release dose) so it would be in my blood 24-7.  I’ve only been on it a couple of days, but I love it so far!  I actually did wake up in the middle of the night last night feeling anxious, but my heart wasn’t racing!  I kind of laughed because my body was almost unable to produce a panic attack, and went back to sleep.

26,Propranolol,Panic Disorder,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"October 19, 2018",34,"This pill is nothing short of a miracle drug. I was hesitant at first, but after reading all of these comments I figured why not give it a shot. I had a bad presentation about a year ago and ever since then I’ve been petrified of standing in front of a large group of people and giving a few minute presentation. I just did a 30 min presentation and by golly did the pill work. I took 40mg around 2 hours before, then another 20mg 45 minutes before the presentation. It completely got rid of the physical symptoms Including red face, quivering voice, and sweating. That presentation was a breeze...it should be a legit crime that people don’t know about this drug. Doctors don’t have a problem prescribing it because it’s an old medicine and makes it nearly impossible to take too much.",TheStudent
27,Propranolol,Panic Disorder,8.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"September 7, 2018",43,"I was prescribed propranolol for panic attacks. This drug was almost as effective as a benzodiazepine. It calmed the very uncomfortable physical effects of having a panic attack. It did nothing for my racing thoughts, but I was able to control those after my body was calm. Sadly, I had to discontinue using it because it gave me double vision and extremely heavy eyelids. It is a fantastic alternative to other anxiety meds since it isn’t addictive. I’d recommend propranolol to anyone who suffers from panic disorder.",Ashley

29,Propranolol,Panic Disorder,9.0,Taken for 10 years or more,"February 22, 2018",38,"I am 52 and have had devastating panic attacks since age 12. I tried tricyclics, then an SSRI (Zoloft) with limited results. Than I was given a ""wonder drug,"" the benzodiazepine Xanax and my panic went from a 10 to a 2. That didn't last long because Xanax requires increased dosage to get past the tolerance your body develops to achieve the same result. After two years my doctor had me on a prescription of 8mg/day, (2mg 4x/day), an extremely high amount. In addition, Xanax is not intended for long term anti-anxiety therapy. I was getting into car accidents, couldn't concentrate, had slow reaction times, memory problems, etc. I also had to walk around with my prescription bottle in my pocket. I went to another doctor who introduced to Propranolol and it works wonders. Effexor XR also works well for me.

30,Propranolol,Panic Disorder,9.0,,"February 10, 2018",58,"I take propranolol (40mg) twice a day - one first thing in the morning and another at lunch (early afternoon). It’s not a miracle pill that will take away your anxiety and panic for good, but it certainly helps. I don’t feel so panicky through out the day (it takes the edge off the anxiety) and although I still get panic attacks they aren’t as intense or as terrifying as they were before. For me the surge of adrenaline and the physical symptoms of a panic attack were very distressing - my heart felt like it was going to explode, I would shake terribly, my body would feel very weird (numbness/tingling/hot-cold flushes/muscle tension). However, thanks to propranolol these physical sensations that occur when I have a panic have significantly decreased in intensity. They are very mild now, barely noticeable and I no longer fear having a panic attack as much as I did before and it’s helped me face my fears and give more freedom to my life. I highly recommend.",Tim456357

I don't use it for social anxiety I just use it intermittently when the panic attack starts where ever it comes on. It's a better alternative for me then using a only a benzo since I don't get tired after and can continue my day with driving around. Sometimes I have to use it in combination with a benzo to get over the humps on bad days or when I can't get anything done. Overall I have positive experiences with this and no side effects.,Laur12

33,Propranolol,Panic Disorder,10.0,Taken for 5 to 10 years,"August 27, 2017",26,"Using 40 mg every AM & 20-40 mg as needed for at five years, it’s my saving grace in most everyday situations that can cause panic or anxiety. I used benzos for 15+ years with a strong dependency, I honestly thought I’d never get off them, until Propranolol. One dose in the morning carries me through to lunch, and only if needed do I take more. The ER version lowered my pulse below 55, even at the lowest dose, and honestly it didn’t work half as well. Maybe it’s mind over matter but I start to feel relief from panic or anxiety within 15 minutes and I’m fine within a half hour at most.

48,Propranolol,Panic Disorder,10.0,,"August 7, 2015",49,This medicine saved my life. I have panic disorder and a mild heart condition. When I was first diagnosed with my heart condition I could not leave the house for fear something would happen to me  - I guess agoraphobia set in. This medicine stopped my heart from beating rapidly and calmed me down together with my other medicines. A wonderful medicine.,ChopsDudley
49,Propranolol,Panic Disorder,9.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"April 30, 2015",86,"I've tried Buspar, Xanax, Ativan, various anti-depressants, anti-psychotics and even cyclobenzaprine (muscle relaxant). Propranolol (20mg daily) has been the best medication of ALL of these for generalized anxiety. No ""swimming head"", no dry mouth, no ravenous hunger... almost no side effects, except I feel a bit slow before my morning shower. Propranolol gives a nice ""body calm"" - heart rate steady, no sweating palms and no jittery feeling. I now use low doses of Propranolol and Imipramine for generalized anxiety and panic, and Lamotrigine for cyclothymia, and (rarely) Ativan. I feel like a new man! They also use Propranolol to treat PTSD patients... it blocks the ""fight/flight"" reaction and allows processing of trauma.",Northern_Guy
50,Propranolol,Panic Disorder,8.0,,"April 13, 2015",77,"Over the last 6 months , I've been suffering from panic attacks and severe anxiety. Accompanied with  frequent fear I experience daily physical symptoms ( pain in chest, dizziness  rapid heart rate etc. which started to control my daily life. I started taking Propranolol 10MG 3 times a day, within about 2-3 days I felt so much calmer and could cope with day to day life a lot better. Over the course of a few weeks my anxiety attacks and panic were becoming fewer and fewer . this medication has been a big turning point for me . Fingers crossed this continues",Anonymous
51,Propranolol,Panic Disorder,8.0,,"December 18, 2014",38,"Works great.  For very stressful events, its not enough. I take 20 mg plus 0.5 mg Ativan. That does the trick 1 hour before. If its a mildly stressful event I don't need the Ativan. Just the 20 mg. it's not effective for me anyway to stop a panic attack after its started. I need Ativan plus propranolol for that.",Joe beningo

I was very paranoid about taking ANY medication but I sucked it up and dealt with it. I'm so glad I did because my life has now changed because of it. My heart rate would beat out of control triggering panic and anxiety. I should mention that I am a strong believer in medication to only be a GUIDE into creating a healthy lifestyle both mentally and physically.",RobRob1985

55,Propranolol,Panic Disorder,7.0,,"September 9, 2014",36,"I was prescribed propranolol 4 years ago and was on 160mg daily for around a year and it worked straight away. Took away the racing heart and trembling hands and made me feel normal, after around 6 months I started to feel light headed and dizzy and was moved down to 80mg daily which I was on for around 2 years, when I felt I was on better control of my panic attacks I started to titrate down the propranolol as you are not allowed to just stop taking it and this is the downside, as when my panic attacks where under control, I was starting to get a racing heart and trembling again as the doctors where trying to get my titration rate sorted out and I was moved down too quickly. It took 18 months to do this which was the downside.",worrier123
56,Propranolol,Panic Disorder,8.0,,"November 8, 2013",68,"I tried Cipralex for 6 months, then Wellbutrin XL for 4 months.  They helped but still not able to function ( No work, moved home, no friends, Not willingly leaving the house, avoiding social anything).  I was then prescribed Propranolol with the Wellbutrin, a gradual build up to 20mg over 1 month.  Now I am as cool as a cucumber.  Still a bit nervous to head outside but that is just thoughts and not a physical reaction.  No side effects besides weird dreams but that might be from the Wellbutrin.  The first time in a year since this all started I am seeing a light at the end of the tunnel.   I am 28, male, heavy drinker.  Alcohol might be why this all started.

59,Propranolol,Panic Disorder,8.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"June 19, 2012",75,"Inderal is a really great alternative to benzodiazepines for anxiety and panic attacks. I have generalized anxiety disorder and am prone to having panic attacks, especially in high stress situations that I can't get out of right away. I am prescribed 20mg to take as needed, up to three times a day. When I have my panic attacks, I fear that I might have a heart attack or some bad heart problem because my panic makes my heart pound so hard and fast. Inderal is a beta blocker that blocks adrenaline, so when I take it, my heart slows down a little and doesn't feel as though it is pounding in my chest. It doesn't remove my panic completely but it prevents my anxiety and worries from building. I like Inderal because it is safe and not addictive.",Anonymous
