0,Zoloft,Panic Disorder,8.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"April 2, 2022",1,"Hey everyone I’m a 32 year old female that started taking Zoloft a week ago! Your comments really helped me to even start taking it so thanks to everyone that left a review because I’m scared of medicine. I am to leave a review in hopes to help someone like me! I started on 25mg but broke it in half to get it into my system for one week and I will move up to my 25mg but my experience so far I have had sleepless nights, headaches, diarrhea, not really been hungry but y’all don’t let that scare you like it did me.  I’m telling you even on a small dose I can tell a small adjustment already and I will be back in another week to update y’all on the dose increase, but take a leap of faith and try it I can already tell I’m feeling some what better just in a week! We are all in this together!",Renee
1,Zoloft,Panic Disorder,10.0,Taken for 5 to 10 years,"March 24, 2022",2,"It's a mystery to me why anyone would be afraid to take antidepressants. Well actually no, it's not a mystery. I'm sure it's because of all the sensationalism in the media. It's a good example of what a grave disservice the media can do the public. Mental health medicine is no different from other medicines. This one treats depression. That's why it's called an                  ""anti"" ""depressant"". What's less well known is that antidepressants usually treat anxiety as well, including panic attacks. Actually, most antidepressants are some of the safest medicines on the market. Zoloft saved my life. It made a dark gloomy depression just disappear. I felt like a huge burden had been lifted off my shoulders.",Anonymous
2,Zoloft,Panic Disorder,10.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"March 9, 2022",5,"I have had panic disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, OCD, and depression. I have struggled with anxiety since I was a child. I have been in therapy since I was young, have done CBT and seen my therapist regularly. I have done all of the things that I was supposed to do. Exercise, healthy eating, sunlight, sleep, etc... I developed an intense fear of not sleeping. Literally it consumed all of me. I was insanely depressed because I was mentally exhausted from the anxiety and obsession I developed about sleep. I was able to get through it without medication but it took time and it was very hard. It happened again out of nowhere, nothing triggered me.  That's when I realized I needed medication as I clearly have some time of imbalance in my brain and this isn't my fault nor something I can control. I have been taking 50 mg of Zoloft for 5 weeks now and have improved drastically. I literally have stopped caring about the sleep. Do not give up. Do not let the negative reviews deter you.",Anna
3,Zoloft,Panic Disorder,9.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"March 9, 2022",2,"Simply put, this medication saved my life and allowed me to return to my normal self. I was so hesitant about going on medication for my anxiety but I’m so happy I did. The beginning stages as you are getting used to the medication are rough i won’t lie. But once you get past those 2-3 weeks it’s like a breath of fresh air. I was having panic attacks every day all day long, now I can function normally again and love the life I live :)",natalie

5,Zoloft,Panic Disorder,9.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"February 27, 2022",2,"I started taking Zoloft about 3 years ago and yes, the first 4 weeks were hard Increased anxiety, insomnia, sweaty hands, headache and nausea, eventually went away, the last one to go was insomnia. After about 6 months we added welbutrin to counteract the procrastination that Zoloft caused. During the period of having the side effects I went back to the Doctor several times and following helped:1) Valium to help ease the initial increase in anxiety2) First Valium to help overcome the insomnia, but did not help, so put on trazodone.3) Going to the gym and having a good 30 minute intense aerobic exercise session (had to take valium first, so anxiety went down and I had motivation to go)Zoloft comes with side effects, if you get them, go back to your Doctor and get meds to ease the side effects. Don't continue to suffer. I came off Zoloft and recently started it again. Made sure I got prescription for Trazadone and Valium. Week 3 and side effects have been well managed",Rob
6,Zoloft,Panic Disorder,9.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"February 23, 2022",5,"I'm on this for anxiety and stress.  I posted a while back, but wanted to check in after about 8 months. Only 50 mg daily. My anxiety  has basically completely subsided. The only continuing side effect that I seem to have is a deep afternoon tiredness, to the point that I have to take a nap nearly every day now.  I still have some depression, and some days I can get pretty dour. My doctor prescribed Wellbutrin to me today. I'll be combining it with my Zoloft to try to offset some of the fatigue and help with the doldrums. If not for the tiredness, I would give zoloft 10 out of 10. It eliminated my anxiety.",judonerd
7,Zoloft,Panic Disorder,1.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"February 19, 2022",0,"I was on zoloft for 3 years at 50mg and did well. It started to lose its effectiveness and we raised the dose to 100mg. My life turned into a giant panic attack for weeks. I went to the ER 3x. My vision was blurry, I couldn't stand up straight, I lost 25lbs from nausea and apathy, I was emotionally a zombie, I couldn't smile to my kids,  I developed such a deep depression that I checked myself into inpatient.  Drs tried to stabilize me back at 50mg but the depression wouldn't lift. I have been off it for 2 weeks now.  I'm scared I'll never find my normal again, but I feel so much better than I did on it.  After completing genetic testing, I discovered this drug does not work with my genes.",User
8,Zoloft,Panic Disorder,5.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"February 15, 2022",0,"Worked well to quiet my obsessive thoughts and panic attacks but unfortunately the side effects turned out to be worse than my mental disorders. I started having migraines almost immediately, memory loss, scattered thoughts, extremely dry eyes and nightly teeth clenching so bad I had to start wearing a night guard. I actually spent 2 years looking for other reasons with multiple doctors for these ailments but in the end they were all caused by the Zoloft. I finally quit taking it and one by one all these ailments disappeared. I think this is a good drug, it did what it was supposed to do and might work wonders for others, definitely give it a try But if you start having issues like me, don’t suffer for years like I did. Stop taking it and try something else.",Middle age lady
9,Zoloft,Panic Disorder,10.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"February 9, 2022",2,"Don’t listen to all the negative comments.   If you have anxiety or panic this is the drug to have.   It takes some time to work maybe 6 to 8 weeks .   I’ve been on this drug over a year and it’s been great.   I have no panic or anxiety.  I’m seeping better then I have in years.  I had some side effects in the beginning, nothing major but they went away in 7 to 10 days.",WH71
10,Zoloft,Panic Disorder,10.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"January 18, 2022",25,"I promised myself that if this drug made my life better I would come back to comment on this thread. I'm a 21 year old male and started Zoloft about 3 months ago after being on Remeron for 4 years for GAD and Panic Disorder. I had no appetite, lost 20 pounds in about 2 weeks, throwing up twice a day, multiple panic attacks, and was in a dark place. My doctor suggested I try Zoloft to which I reluctantly agreed. I was titrated up to 150mg in about a week. My first week was awful. It peaked my anxiety, I felt extremely tense, racing thoughts, nausea, pacing around etc. 2nd week I felt extremely numb, emotionless, and just out of it. My least favorite side effect was brain fog. 8 weeks later and I felt amazing, I'm back to my old self but a lot more confident and happy. My advice is don't look at your progress day to day but rather week to week you'll see the improvement. I came on here everyday my first few weeks looking for hope that things would get better and now they are. :)",:))
11,Zoloft,Panic Disorder,,Taken for less than 1 month,"January 3, 2022",9,"I started having panic attacks out the blue about a year ago. Initially I shrugged it off as nerves, I started noticing after a while that I couldn’t live, I wanted to stay home all the time and just found myself in a panic from thinking about the smallest things. One night while sleep I just woke up heart racing chest tight, I was having a full blown panic attack that felt like I was having a heart attack! Ended up going to the hospital, my blood pressure was up along with palpitations when I arrived. My heart was checked my blood everything all came back normal…I was so confused and felt defeated. I made a follow up appointment with my doctor who prescribed me Zoloft, so far I have taken it one time and have had it for 2 weeks. I am so afraid of my panic attacks increasing while on this from the reviews I have read. Me taking the one dose that I did had me freaking out. But reading words of encouragement  is giving me the strength to start it again. I will try my best to push through.",Kelly
12,Zoloft,Panic Disorder,9.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"January 3, 2022",3,"I was prescribed Zoloft after being diagnosed with panic disorder at age 24. The panic attacks came out of the blue and were debilitating, I truly felt like I was going crazy. I tried everything natural (meditation, lemon balm, exercise, no caffeine, etc..) and Zoloft has been the only successful remedy! While the first 3-4 weeks are uncomfortable (inability to orgasm, nausea, worsened anxiety), all those side effects go away! It's sooo worth it to stick it out. I feel so normal now, giving presentations at work without a shred of anxiety. My libido came back too! Only complaint is some moderate weight gain, despite no change in diet.",mxw10
13,Zoloft,Panic Disorder,10.0,Taken for 5 to 10 years,"January 1, 2022",3,"I started back on Zoloft this morning, due to a bad decision to take Wellbutrin.  I am sorry, but Wellbutrin isn't the pill of choice for anxiety.  I was on it 6 days and I have been without sleep for 3 nights in a row and have lost my appetite today.  My heart pounded constantly and my body would never settle down.  I am having intrusive thoughts (one song keeps looping in my head).  I had several panic attacks in the last few days after stopping it.  I made the decision to go back to my old faithful, Zoloft.  I got off of it July, due to weight gain, after having been on it twice within 8 years.  I gained about 10 or 12 pounds from it.  At this point, I don't care about the weight gain!  I want sleep, a calmer spirit, and peace of mind.  Zoloft did give me diarrhea this morning and made me nauseous, something that I did not experience the first two times taking the meds.  I know that the next couple of weeks will not be pleasant, but I will push through it to get to the other side.",Ready For Chang
14,Zoloft,Panic Disorder,10.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"December 29, 2021",2,"I'm on sertraline for severe anxiety. I might also have OCD or PTSD. (either way, I experience compulsions, dissociation, panic, and intrusive thoughts) I started on 25mg and noticed an improvement about right away. I was scared it would make me jumpier (I've read it can cause either stimulation or sleepiness) but luckily it knocks me RIGHT out.  I actually had to start taking it at night instead because I was yawning so much my jaw started hurting. I went up to 50mg when I was tolerating the side effects. I have been on it for about 2 months now.Side effects for me have included, and I will tag (R) if the symptoms have reduced or gone away as time has gone on: Nausea (R)Lack of appetite (R)Difficulty sleeping through the night (melatonin has greatly helped with this)Earworms (R)Difficulty reaching orgasm (but no reduced libido)Increased hypnic jerksReduced alcohol tolerance (cannabis tolerance is the same)HAVING MY LIFE BACK.

15,Zoloft,Panic Disorder,10.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"December 21, 2021",3,"This past year, I would get panic attacks that would lead to anxiety. The sensations and feelings  would last a day or two, and would go away (happened three different times). Then in early October it happened, and didn't go away. My doctor prescribed by 50 mg of Zoloft (once a day) and the lowest dose of Xanax (as needed). The first week of Zoloft was a nightmare. The anxiety was at all time high, no appetite, dry mouth, diarrhea, and couldn't sleep. The Xanax was able to take the edge off a little bit. If I didn't have the Xanax, I probably would have stopped taking the Zoloft. After 10 days, things became a little less intense. I was able to eat, anxiety was still present but at a much lower level, and stomach issues were no longer. About 5-6 weeks later I noticed that I am back to almost 100% anxiety free. It comes and goes, but a lot easier to deal with it. Not constantly stressing. It was worth it. Don't give up. Therapy also helped me!",Male 28
16,Zoloft,Panic Disorder,3.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"December 6, 2021",3,"I was prescribed Zoloft and was brave enough to start it 3 days ago. I'm always scared to try new meds and try holistic as much as I can. I was able to manage anxiety with diet and exercise until I got Covid 6 weeks ago.  3 days in I started having panic attacks and then experienced insomnia like I never had before. I would lay awake all night and couldn’t sleep. Saw Family doc who gave me Xanax which would give me a few hours of sleep here and there. Well I hadn’t slept for 8 days and had a full blown panic attack that landed me in the Psych ER. They started me on some meds to help me sleep which they do but now the anxiety is back and added depression on top of everything. The doc wanted me to start Zoloft right away but I was nervous so now 2 weeks later I’m desperate and started it. Have had Diarrhea and just feel very anxious, running thoughts and can’t sit still. I still have to work so I’m pushing through and praying I start feeling something positive soon. Will update",Ang
17,Zoloft,Panic Disorder,8.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"November 29, 2021",2,"I've always dealt with Generalized Anxiety more so than panic disorder, but I have been on Zoloft for about 2 and a half to 3 years now, I am 18 going on 19. Prior to starting medication, I was nervous, seeing bad reviews, or side effects. I thought it would be easier to just not deal with it but I am glad I took the risk. I did not really have too bad of effects, just a little nausea the first few weeks, and insomnia the first few months. Occasional night sweats depend on if I mess with my dosage but it's manageable. I feel more balanced and I am not as prone to panic attacks or just anxiety in general. I still get a healthy amount of anxiety as some days can be better than others but it's not crippling. My appetite definitely decreased a bit being on this medication but not to an unhealthy extent, if anything it helped me balance out my weight to a healthy amount, I feel more confident. I am grateful for this medication, good luck on your med journey!",Athena Stad
18,Zoloft,Panic Disorder,10.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"November 24, 2021",8,"ZOLOFT IS AMAZING! I read through these reviews a million times before I started Zoloft, I was so anxious about taking meds I put it off for 2 years but my anxiety & panic got so bad I knew I needed more help! Counselling and camomile tea could only do so much. I started taking 25mgs of Zoloft in the mornings but I was so tired after I couldn’t go to work let alone drive there. The side effects were pretty crap for the first week, on day four I was so emotional I cried literally all day, not kidding  8 hours straight of crying uncontrollably! I was tired and i felt dizzy and just off kind of like my brain was in a bubble.. it was a chore to make myself take it every day, I had to psych myself up! After a week I started taking it at night, after two weeks all my symptoms stopped, I was far less anxious! 8 weeks in and I haven’t had a panic attack or been overly anxious at all. Zoloft changed my life. I’m a better mum, friend and partner. I’m actually happy and enjoying life!",Shannie
19,Zoloft,Panic Disorder,10.0,Taken for 5 to 10 years,"November 18, 2021",1,"Zoloft changed my life, I'm 23 years old. I was on it for 8 years, was able to get through college, do well in school, have a great social life. Sure, it wasn't a magic pill - I felt anxious from time to time but it truly changed my life. Recently, it stopped working (after 8 years) and I was switched to prozac. My experience with Prozac has been horrific, I have never felt worse in my life. It truly made me appreciate how amazing of a medication Zoloft was. Everyone is different and these medicines affect everyone differently. Although it stopped working and I had break through panic attacks almost daily, it certainly worked for a long time and I feel lucky I found it.",Changed my life

Today on day 8 I’m finally feeling like a person again. I had forgotten to take my Zoloft for about 4 days and overall have been really inconsistent with it and it definitely backfired . Idk what happened but I found myself bed bound with constant panic and anxiety . I was scared of everything . Light , taking a bath, going to my kitchen , the world around me. I was in fear for 8 days straight and it was torture. I was just trying to hold on until the medicine kicked in again and sure enough it did . Zoloft takes time and very slowly you see progress .

22,Zoloft,Panic Disorder,10.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"November 1, 2021",23,"For the last 12 years I have experienced anxiety however I have always been able to cope without medication. Then last March my random bouts of anxiety and panic attacks became crippling. I suffer from health anxiety and most recently panic disorder. I started have panic attacks that would last days. I couldn't go anywhere. I started on 50 mg and the first day extreme drowsiness, tiredness, and just felt off. I really did not like the side effects so I switched to 25 mg and took it at night before bed. The first week sucked but the anxiety really went away. I'm on week 5 now. Last week I went back up to the 50 mg. I feel great! I feel like my old self again. My heart rates down and I have had no panic attacks at all! My husband and daughter are so happy. Side effects suck but they do get better! I promised myself to write a review because the others help me get through that first week. It was scary but Im so grateful.",Samantha
23,Zoloft,Panic Disorder,10.0,,"October 28, 2021",16,"I would rate Zoloft a 10/10. Zoloft has given me a whole new take on life. Prior to zoloft I had struggled with severe anxiety and panic attacks with PTSD and OCD. The doctor started me on 25mg and 2 years later I am still on the same dose. I am a 30 year old female and they say the starting adult dose is generally 50mg but my anxiety had me suspicious of taking anything let alone a higher dose, so I opted for half of what is recommended. And believe me my life is better than I could have ever imagined. I haven't had a panic attack since I started on Zoloft. My OCD is non existent and well as for my anxiety it is completely manageable, the only time it tries to creep up on me is if I work too much and miss out on sleep. I am on here to give hope to others.",Sandie

25,Zoloft,Panic Disorder,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"October 21, 2021",1,"I've had horrible panic attacks for 3 years now. It started when I took a muscle relaxer after an injury. I hated how it made me feel and I went to the ER because I thought I was dying. From that day forward I lived in fear of another panic attack CONSTANTLY. It got worse and worse. I started panicking when I had to go more than 30 min from home, I'd panic every time it rained, I even started to get scared of the dark. I felt like my life was over and I'm only 25. I finally caved and got a zoloft prescription. I started VERY slow. I was on 6 mg and the first day I felt a LITTLE weird and drowsy, but by day 2 I could already tell a difference. After 5 days I went up to 12.5 mg and its now day 2. I already feel so much better. I still get anxiety but it passes instead of me obsessing. Its like I don't care to entertain those thoughts anymore. I can't wait to see how much better it gets! If you're scared of side effects start slow. My only side effect was diarrhea and feeling sleepy.",panicqueen

I was prescribed 50mg of zoloft and the side effects were so awful that I hid the bottle away. After a few more months living in a nightmare, I decided to try again, but starting at 12.5mg. I upped my dose 12.5mg every week until I reached 50mg. The side effects were so awful, but the pay out was SO WORTH IT! It was about 5 weeks of heightened anxiety, insomnia, grinding my teeth, intrusive thoughts, etc. There were so many days I felt like this medication wasn't working.

I experienced anxiety for a majority of my life and tried to manage the symptoms with vitamins and exercise.  After having a child and more stressors in life my anxiety peeked.  I began drinking alcohol to cope with the anxious feelings, which made the anxiety 100% worse the next day.  I was in a toxic cycle, then started to become depressed because I thought things would never get better.  I started to panic anytime I would leave the house and was anxious about every little thing.  I called my doctor in desperate need of help.  She prescribed me Zoloft (started with 25mg for the 1st week, then increased to 50mg).  The first week I had terrible side effects and desperately wanted to stop the medication because my anxiety was worse.  I stuck it out and after the 2nd week I started to feel some relief.

37,Zoloft,Panic Disorder,9.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"September 14, 2021",0,"I have suffered with GAD for as long as I can remember. I have specifically struggled with sleep since I was young, when I had a fear of sleeping/not being able to sleep alone. In my early twenties my anxiety was triggered to the point where I needed to start medication. I had intrusive/obsessive thoughts and it was terrifying. I was put on Pristiq by my GP which in conjunction with CBT worked well. 3 years later I had to up my dose as the anxiety ramped up again, it gradually levelled out. Within the last 6 months I had some change with my work circumstances and my fear of insomnia returned. It was a vicious cycle. I went on and off sleeping medication, tried different CBT methods. Nothing was strong enough to beat the beast of anxiety. 2 GPs told me to NOT change medication and stick with pristiq since it had worked for so many years. I just knew it wasn’t working for my body anymore. Part 2 in next post",Mbelletti

Sure it works for those with milder anxieties but not really for more severe or chronic anxiety (or more panic disorder type issues). It didn't matter that my prescription was at its maximum dose it didn't help me at all, there wasn't even any side effects to show that it was working. I still panicked and still was anxious constantly and I just had to switch up the prescription to a different medication because it just didn't do anything. It's great for those with more moderate and less severe anxiety but I highly don't recommend it for those with severe anxiety and panic disorders.",i exist

I have suffered from GAD and panic disorder since high school. I had a really bad episode my senior year in college. I had to go to the doctor bc I thought I was dying. Vomiting, nausea, tingly hands, lump in throat, sweating and general out of body feeling. Had no idea. Prescribed paxil and Xanax. Changed meds and have been on 100mg Zoloft for 15 years with no panic attacks and minimal anxiety. Then this summer we decided to renovate our home. Our cat got stressed cystitis and became very sick. These triggered me into 24 hour anxiety loop. I went back to the doctor and he added buspar. That worked short term. Went back and let him know that I had lost 10 lbs bc of nausea. He upped my dose to 150mg Zoloft and Xanax . At first, my symptoms got worse! But I read that that can happen with upping the dose.

A bit more positive but nervous plus a lot of anxiety/brain fog especially in the mornings. Doctor said, I need a few more months on it. I can see the change but I'd say I am only 80% ok now.

I was still drowsy during the day for about a week though even after taking it at night. I didn't have much of an appetite at first either and lost some weight which I'm not complaining about. lol. Now after almost a month of taking it I am soooo glad I did. I feel like myself again. It might be weird at first but please if you need it then try it, and if it sucks tell your doctor but if you can handle the side effects stick with it, it really does get better and totally worth it! I'm having almost zero negative side effects now and am out and about doing the things I had a seriously hard time doing before.",bride2be

I thought my heart was going to pound out of my chest. I used to take lexapro and it was a really good drug for me, but had no energy. I took it for 3 years! So I’ve been off a year and I started my anxiety symptoms again about a week ago. I went back to the doctor this past Tuesday and had a bunch of test ran and was put back on anxiety medicine, but this time Zoloft 25 MG... I took half on Tuesday and Wednesday night. Thursday my heart felt like it was pounding so I decided to take a 3rd. It did the same thing. Yesterday I had a terrible panic attack while picking my daughter up from school and had to take half of a Xanax .25 mg. So I let me doctor know that I would not be taking that anymore and would like to try something else with a lower dose like 10 mg... maybe fluoxetine or something like that..",Jo258

For those 3 weeks I had no energy or appetite (lost 10 lbs) which is hard when you need to work and go to school! I was living in a foggy state of 24/7 anxiety and felt like I couldn't escape from it and I knew it was the medicine making it worst but I wanted to ride it out since I had positive experiences before.

I still have minor anxiety but just a normal human amount. I am happy and healthy and I have a girlfriend for the first time in my life and I am working out and I am doing well at work. The bad side effects are non existent for me. Sleep, appetite and weight were unaffected. When I started Zoloft the anxiety skyrocketed.

My heart rate would increase, my breathing became uneasy, and my thoughts became irrational and I felt like I was out of my mind. I felt genuinely hopeless. After consultation with my doctor I seemed to have panic disorder was prescribed 50 mg of zoloft. I will say the first two weeks were AWFUL. My appetite decreased, I was nauseous, and my depression and anxiety elevated. However, afterwards it was like something clicked and my thoughts stopped racing so much and I could experience life again w/o fearing a panic attack. Although I still have some rough days, zoloft has changed my life. If I can sense a panic attack coming, it’s more tolerable and not as scary. A lot of people quit this medication because the first couple weeks of adjusting can be rough. For me, I rode it out and I am relieved that I did.

The first few months were so awful. Soon I was switched to Zoloft, which literally saved my life. 5 years later at the age of twenty I was prescribed Zoloft again for anxiety, not depression. Again I’m experiencing amazing results. I tend to panic, which triggers my asthma and sends my body into over drive. Zoloft has been my life saver for everything. Not all drugs work, out bodies are complicated and complex. However, don’t be scared to trying new drugs cause you might find your life saver too. Also, expect the first few days to be filled with tunnel visit and head ache. Your chemical levels are raising, meaning you will feel it. The second time I tried zoloft I felt strong tunnel vision and over all weirdness. I almost couldn’t drive, no joke. But it’s worth all the worry and you will feel amazing afterwards.

I was back to having panic attacks frequently and the medication no longer was useful. I’m switching to Lexapro soon. My social anxiety has been gone for almost two whole years, which I can contribute to the medication and therapy, but after the relapse, the medication was useless preventing panic attacks and I felt miserable and tired. After the relapse, sometimes it felt like it even exacerbated my symptoms. But I’m sure it works differently for everyone.

I quit my job and got prescribed sertraline (Zoloft) the first few weeks was so hard l but I was use to it. For the past 3/4 years I couldn’t get a tube, train or go into central/shopping centres without having crippling panic attacks. Now 8 weeks after this medication. Wow I’m actually normal, finally after all this time. I can live normally. It’s Incredible I could cry I’m so happy . At first I lost appetite (gone after a week) and lost libido (gone after about 6 weeks). My only side effect is bad sleep but hey it’s worth it.

I didn’t feel like myself, I felt crazy and began snapping at those around me. Mood swings. Almost quit my job. The whole lot. I’m tapering down right now and thankfully starting to feel like myself again. Would not try it again in the future, will take a more natural approach.

After that 2 months this medication stopped working completely. It caused anxiety, mood swings, and really dark thoughts associated with the depressive episodes of the mood swings. I am not trying to say that you or a loved one shouldn’t try Zoloft. This is how it reacted with me but it doesn’t mean that it would do the same to you or a loved one. Just be watchful for any adverse signs. The withdrawal symptoms are slightly uncomfortable. I personally tend to not get severe side effects from starting or stopping a medication.

I stopped all the things I used to enjoy I didn't go to the gym and I wasn't physically active. I felt safe in my room not socialising as this did not cause me to panic. However it was a downward spiral from there. The reason that I felt safe at first was because my anxiety was from my heart beating fast and I was always aware of it ( weird right.) I wanted to avoid all things that would trigger my panic attacks. gotta cut it short so I took 50 mg zoloft and after the first day I haven't had one single panic attack and feel 10x better.

I had no significant side effects on the lower dose, but experienced bad side effects at the higher dose, such as night sweats, very dry mouth, and issues in thought (such as losing my train of thought fairly frequently).  I weaned off slowly and experienced flu like body aches for a couple of weeks as I came off of it.  I don't recall any benefit that I got from being on this drug.  Unfortunately, this medicine did not work for me.",QwertyBird

It helped take the edge off for the first few weeks during the summer, yet after a month into university when everything became stressful again, I stopped seeing results. I went up to 50mg after being on 25mg and I felt absolutely awful. I felt like I was trapped in a box but had to cary the weight of it everywhere. Functioning became harder and harder and I wasn't myself. I went back down and immidietly felt like I did after being on no medication. However at this point I started feeling depressed and suicidal, things that are not usual for me. Now I am beginning to try Fluvoxamine and hopefully it can fix what Zoloft caused.",bballgirl96

I was scared to death to try Zoloft after all the reviews saying things get worse before better and I naturally freak out any time I try any new medication. But, I've been on the 25 mg for about a week and just went to 50. I've had absolutely no side effects other than my brain trying to lie to me, if you know what I mean.

It also numbed me and made me very indifferent to things.  To cut a long story short I stopped after three months and have changed to Citalopram.

However, I have noticed that it has helped me with a little something I now realized were panic attacks (haven't told the therapist or the psychiatrist about them). I went off the Zoloft for 5 days and all hell broke loose. I've been back on it and I realize that I'm very chill now. I don't freak out at every little thing and don't curl up in the corner of my room sobbing about meaningless things and things I can never change. So for panic disorder, I give it a high score. Depression, ..not so much. Oh, and it definitely helps with OCD too. I think I became OCD in some of my panics.",Peaceland

340,Zoloft,Panic Disorder,8.0,,"May 28, 2009",57,"I've been on 75mg for 5 months. I slowly started to feel normal and before I knew it, within 2 months. Had a huge breakthrough. I was no longer having panic attacks. What I like about Zoloft is that it makes me feel like me. Not a drugged up version of me. I had a few side effects like loss of appetite, insomnia but all in all, I feel a lot better.",stressed and depressed
341,Zoloft,Panic Disorder,8.0,,"May 16, 2009",72,"I have been on Zoloft for almost 30 years now and never any higher than 50mg. I was stricken with panic/anxiety disorder in my early 20's, and now early 50's, I have never had to go higher. It keeps the attacks at bay, but once in a while, I will get one. I have heard it is hereditary. I do believe this is the case. Both of my siblings struggle with the attacks, and take Zoloft as well. Both of my girls suffer as well. The youngest one, now 23, has just started on Zoloft, 25 mg and she is not sure if it is working just yet. The oldest one is able to keep them at bay without medicines. You lose your sex drive on these medicines. I have confidence on this drug and hope others will also.",horsey

When I first started this medicine I became depressed, had suicidel thoughts, and no appetite. But those have since gone away as well. The only issue I have noticed still is I have no sex drive. Just wondering if this is normal with this drug and if it will eventually go back to normal.",Yasi
