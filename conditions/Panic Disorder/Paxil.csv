0,Paxil,Panic Disorder,,Taken for 10 years or more,"February 11, 2022",0,So I weaned off Paxil and was completely off it for about two weeks. At about the two week mark my anxiety can back with a vengeance one day. I then realized that I need help and finally admitted to myself I need drugs. I was on 40 December and was off by the beginning of February. From my experience I can tell you after re starting the Paxil again only 10 mg for just two days I can tell the difference already. It just works for me. And I intend to stay on it.,Zeb
1,Paxil,Panic Disorder,7.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"October 21, 2021",0,"Started on Oct.14 2021 to take Paxil 10mg, I’ve been dealing with panic attacks since 2014, but never got a medication for it till now. For the first week on it has been a rollercoaster. First 2 days I was doing fine , till Sunday I started to have a feeling of coldness in the back on my head, that went down my whole body, palpitations, dizziness and a headache. I got scared that I even called my mom. Those symptoms follow up the next day. Tuesday I felt like I was choking to a point that had a panic attack, my body felt numb and cold . I was sweating a lot too.. thank god we got home. On Wednesday I felt emotionless and went to the doctor to let her know the side effects. She said they can put me on another medication but I said no. I didn’t wanted to go through another symptoms so I stick with Paxil. Now I woke up to shortness of breath, and again had a panic attack that I felt chest pain, headache and trouble sleeping. And I have the common side effects. Just hope for the best!",Minmin
2,Paxil,Panic Disorder,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"June 9, 2021",1,"Unfortunately I was started on this at the highest dose. I have no idea why. The nurse even said I shouldn't be on 40 mg to start, but it was a doctor in a crisis center that I saw for 5 minutes. After I started taking it I had the worst panic attack I have ever experienced and I was hyperventilating and almost passed out. So, I stopped taking it and was scared to take any antidepressants after that, although I have suffer from severe depression and anxiety. So, it wasn't for me. I just started taking Lamotrigine for depression and propranolol for anxiety. It is really helping. So this might be an alternative for anyone that experienced what I did.",egogordo
3,Paxil,Panic Disorder,8.0,,"May 28, 2021",11,"Taken daily for nearly 20 years. PRO'S:Worked great for my panic attacks, anxiety, and anger symptoms.CON'S:One side effect noticed that especially with advancing age came ""diminished libido"" due to  difficulty in reaching climax.In attempting to  research the ""libido"" symptomsI discovered that  THIS is one of the ""known"" side effects of the drug.  In fact it was often prescribed for ""premature ejaculation"".The dilemma comes when one attempts to recapture their ""love-life"" by ""reducing"" or ""quitting"" Paxil.Depending on dosage and time on the drug, you MAY INDEED hit a wall of ""withdrawal symptoms"" that ""Ain't No walk-in-the-park""!  For more details just do a search for say ""Paxil Withdrawal Symptoms"". It won't be hard to find a myriad of data. DO Talk with your doctor about it before attempting to quit.For me, it's a work-in-progress.Good Luck All",70david
4,Paxil,Panic Disorder,1.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"February 22, 2021",5,"I took it for 1 year and a half, at first it seemed  to work but then it caused 20kg weight gain, nightmares, general weakness, fibromyalgia not being able to even get out of bed, always angry and agitated, chest pain, shievering, restless legs, paranoia, depersonalisation, feeling faint, always feeling hungry, gastritis, IBS, shivering, headaches, tinnitus, seeing blurry, feeling like throwing up, suicidal thoughts, hypersensitivity to sound and light, being violent, it was like torture. I felt like my body was chained. I still kept taking it because my doctor said it is me just worrying. But one day I had a gut feeling and stopped taking it slowly over time, now I can walk again and I feel so much better than when I was taking it. I lost the weight that I had gained and feel happier.

5,Paxil,Panic Disorder,1.0,,"February 21, 2021",6,"I started taking paxil 5 years ago for panic attacks . It really works for me, I was going back to my normal life no panic at all, very strong and everything was great. After 5 years when I decided to come off Paxil and I was taking it gradually from 20 mg to 0 within 2 months. Every withdrawal symptoms came to me I felt horrible like it is the end of me seriously (brain zaps , insomnia , nausea, super headache daily, drooping eyelid, blurry eyes). This drug ruined my life now it's been one year I have stopped the drug and I quit my work because of the long term side effect that I have especially daily headache and it's very painful , not enough sleep. I would not recommended to anyone no matter what you have stay away from this living nightmare, I prefer to have panic attacks than having these horrible side effects. Be careful please",Tina

7,Paxil,Panic Disorder,6.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"January 23, 2021",4,"I used Paxil medication for about 8 weeks for anxiety and panic attacks. I promised myself I would come back and write a review because I needed so much reassurance that I would feel better. Overall, my anxiety and panic attacks decreased quite a bit. It also helped me sleep.  Almost was down to no panic attacks after the start up side effects passed. (Around 4 week mark I noticed the changes).However I had some side effects that made me have to change medications. I became very forgetful and felt ""dumb"" and spaced out at times. Very drowsy in the morning but it helped me sleep a lot (oh how I miss sleeping that well!)  It was such a nice break from so much anxiety and panic but because I work in healthcare I knew it wouldn't be good for me as I need my thinking to he sharp. If I had a different career probably would have stayed on it. I also had a lot of constipation. Overall this is a great drug for anxiety. Some side effects not ideal for some people!",Bellyrubs48

14,Paxil,Panic Disorder,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"October 14, 2019",14,"Hi, I used Paroxetine (Paxil) as an adjunct medication whilst weaning off Diazepam. This drug may work for some, but it sure as  didn't work for me!I suspect I had serotonin syndrome from just two doses of 10mg. Yes, TWO DOSES. Therapeutic! I had insane body shivers, felt like a zombie 24/7 whilst on them, I couldn't do the most basic of tasks, I dry heaved non-stop and had persistent air hunger. The withdrawals are terrible and last 3 months or more. If you just have to have an antidepressant , try Celexa or Lexapro instead - they are much milder.I recommend exercise and natural methods/good dieting over ANY anti-depressant. For the sake of your health, Paxil is just not worth it.If you are unfortunate enough to have started on this medication, get off while you still can!",Becarefulofpaxil
15,Paxil,Panic Disorder,1.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"July 26, 2019",20,"This medication seems to work wonders for many people, but it's definitely not for everyone, and it's not the great and wonderful medication that doctors seem to believe it is.I was put on this medication in 2003 because my physician wanted to take me off of the ""evil"" benzodiazepine I had been taking for years to help with panic attacks .  My doctor also decided I was depressed, and since I had just gotten a divorce I probably was.  A few weeks in I felt pretty good, and was pleased except for gaining 20 lbs in one month.  My doctor tested my thyroid, and there wasn't anything wrong with it, so I was told that weight gain is sometimes a side effect but it would level off.  By the time I was about 4 months in I developed insomnia, by month 6 I was angry, smelly because I could barely get through a workday,  bathing was overwhelming, as was cleaning my house.  In the end I was 40 lbs heavier and in dark place.",Samantha

Worst part, I was only on it for about 2 weeks! Day three of being off of it now and although I feel better somewhat I can still feel that these horrid pills are still in my system.

19,Paxil,Panic Disorder,10.0,,"June 15, 2019",68,"Look, Paxil is a game changer. For sure. People listen up, to start, you’re going to have some side effects. Ears ringing, sleep issues, brain zaps, sexual dysfunctions, dry mouth, I could go on. But, one day I woke up after taking it for about six months and wouldn’t you know it, no more panic attacks. And these weren’t mild panic attacks, these were almost driving off the road on the way to work in the morning because you can’t breathe, your shaking like a leaf, throwing up, and can’t see straight type attacks. Severe. I’ve been on 60mg a day for around a decade, and I can’t believe how one little pill can completely change your life in the way it has changed mine. This is so so sooooo much safer than benzodiazepines, and it’s nonaddictive. But, if you stop taking it you can rebound quick. Just trust me on that one. So I’m never coming off of it. It’s a small price to pay right? Thanks!",Life Changer!
20,Paxil,Panic Disorder,10.0,Taken for 10 years or more,"June 8, 2019",24,"Due to a death in our family, I was put on paxil to cope with the panic attacks  that had started, and was leaving me feeling helpless. I was working as a vet tech and had to keep my wits about me. Paxil was a lifesaver as well as xanax. Those two drugs saved me and my job.I just crossed the 6 week mark of being off of Paxil and it is 25 years later!! It's possible to get off this drug, I am living proof. Xanax was easy to stop.

21,Paxil,Panic Disorder,10.0,Taken for 10 years or more,"April 17, 2019",63,I was 19 when I got my first panic attack then severe depression. I stayed home for a month. I couldn’t eat or sleep and lost 25 lbs. I am so thankful Paxil and therapy saved me. I was able to feel normal again. I started working and dating again then had a child. After my son turned one I started college when he turned one. I was 26 with an 8th grade education (dropped out at 13) when I started college!!!  I was able to handle the stress of being a mother and a full time college student while working 25 hours a week. I am living proof Paxil works. Without it I am a mess (took myself off for 6 months). I graduated with a 3.92 GPA in Public Health and I know I could have done it without Paxil. It may work different for everyone but I just wanted to share a positive experience. Give it time. Give yourself time. Life is too short to suffer with anxiety and depression. It is ok to need help.,New Me
22,Paxil,Panic Disorder,5.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"December 9, 2018",6,"After the birth of my daughter probably within hours I experienced a panic attack , months later I was still having them every week , feeling worried and anxious about everything having irrational thoughts that just wouldn’t budge , that’s when I was diagnosed with postpartum anxiety.  I was prescribed Paxil (paroxantine 10 mg). I would cry everyday before that but it did kinda help with my crying spells however for my anxiety I feel like it got worse. I know they say to give it 4-6 weeks  I gave it 5 1/2 on 10 mg . Side effects in the first 2 weeks where constant yawning and feeling heavy eyed similar to what allergies feel like in the eyes and increased appetite which was better than not eating at all , I did still have panic attacks and down days . So I didn’t think it was the right fit for me and switched to something else .",Mom with PPA
23,Paxil,Panic Disorder,10.0,,"October 14, 2018",52,"Don't make my mistake!! I've kept switching SSRI's because I thought ""they aren't working"" after 2 or 3 weeks.Eventually, I just settled on one SSRI but would ""self medicate"" on the weekends by binging alcohol in social situations etc.  The result was that  SSRIs never had a chance to work for me. So after being on them for 5 years and having no benefits from ""trying different ones"", I thought to myself I would never ever go back on them. I haven't used any SSRI for 7 years since. Thinking they don't work at all.I finally caved in out of desperation. This time I convinced myself that I would take them nonstop for 3 months WITHOUT switching and not taking ANY alcohol.It took about 6-7 weeks until I felt TOTALLY different!!!I hope this helps someone.  These medications aren't supposed to magically work at exactly 3-4 weeks. It's a cumulative effect.",anony
24,Paxil,Panic Disorder,10.0,,"August 31, 2018",36,"3 years ago, I began having severe panic attacks alongside my IBS (irritable bowel syndrome). It made me feel like I was going to die, symptoms included vomiting, diarrhea, chest tightness, irregular breathing and immobility. This escalated to me waking up almost every morning scared for my life, nauseous & vomiting.  These episodes would last between 8 hours to 3 days. I could no longer intake food or water and was really underweight, I lost 30lbs. I found an amazing doctor who prescribed me 20mg of Paxil 9 months ago. Within 2 weeks, I noticed a COMPLETE change in my mood and outlook on life. I no longer wake up with panic attacks. I have had about 3 panic episodes in total since being prescribed Paxil when in comparison to when I used to wake up everyday mentally ill. When I have IBS episodes still, sometimes my anxiety surfaces while I'm in the bathroom. Aside from that, Paxil changed my life and made me such a more confident and happy person. I also successfully gained back all the weight that I lost!",Monica
25,Paxil,Panic Disorder,8.0,,"July 1, 2018",17,"Started on 10mg for panic disorder and worked up to 20mg. It enabled me to accomplish things I couldn't do before, but didn't completely rid me of all anxiety, just took the edge off enough to allow me to function. Recently my anxiety/panic has gotten steadily worse, so I'm going to request going up to 40mg, the target dose for panic disorder. I had next to no side effects other than some insomnia and a brief bout of sexual dysfunction where it was hard to climax. I gained about 17 lbs. since starting it, but I also feel better enough to go out to restaurants and I eat out about 4 times a week. My exercise routine has also slackened due to lack of motivation. I suppose it could slow down metabolism, assuming the weight gain isn't entirely my fault (which I think it is), but even so, it's really not a deal-breaker considering how severe my anxiety was. Even though my dosage now needs adjusting, it has helped me lead a semi-normal life for the past year.",kevindcl
26,Paxil,Panic Disorder,9.0,,"June 8, 2018",20,"I started Paxil along with my twin sister at the age of 19 for severe, debilitating panic attacks/chronic anxiety. I remember we actually felt worse the first couple of weeks but our doctor told us to hold on and push through—that those sick feelings would go away. A low dose of Xanax also helped the first few weeks. I went without anxiety or an attack for 15 years. I weaned off of it for 8 months and anxiety came back.  I’m back on 20mg. It took a couple months for anxiety to subside but it’s working like it’s supposed to again. Because I’m now 40 and having hormonal issues, I might have mild anxiety around my cycle. It’s odd when it happens. I have emergency low dose of Xanax for those times—nothing as severe as before Paxil. It has saved mine and my twin sister’s life.  It’s a great medication for anxiety. Nervousness and anxiety run in my family as we are all high strung. I didn’t gain crazy weight because I’m an athlete and very active.",Painter

When my doctor realized what was going on with me, he put me on 20mg of Paxil.I must say the first week on it was very difficult, but I believe it's because I wasn't told or didn't hear him tell me to take half a pill for the first week.  After about 2 weeks or so, I woke up one morning and absolutely felt like I was on cloud 9.  Not because it made me high, but because I felt normal again!

37,Paxil,Panic Disorder,2.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"July 16, 2016",12,I started Paxil  to control anxiety.  The first brand was Auribindo. It worked about one month.  I was using less Klonopin. Then out of the blue I had a Panic attack that put me in the hospital overnight.  Then I switched generic brands to Zydus.  On my first dose I thought I would die.  It felt like I had overdosed. It happened within 10 minutes of taking that brand.  It was only 15mg.  I have now received the Dylan brand and will take it in the morning.  I say this for people who think the Paxil may not work.  You need to do a trial run on these no good generics.  I felt like I was dying plus so nauseated on the Zydus brand.  Hopefully the Nylon will work.  I am running out of brands to try.,Paul user
