0,Venlafaxine,Panic Disorder,10.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"March 18, 2022",1,"Effexor XR (venlafaxine):This medication has been an answered prayer for me. I lived in fear for almost 2 years, couldn’t go anywhere. I would think I was dying all the time, I went countless visits to the ER just for them to tell me it was panic attacks. This medication has turned me to a complete 180. I enjoy life again, I am no longer afraid, I can do the things I love to do again. I feel myself again for the first time in a long time. Effexor has helped set me free. Medicine is not a one size fits all, I definitely went through trial and error with many different meds. SSRI’s have a very negative effect on me so that’s why my doctor suggested an SNRI and that’s exactly what I needed. this is the one for me and the answer to my prayers. So thankful for it and don’t plan on getting off of it.",Life changing
1,Venlafaxine,Panic Disorder,8.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"February 16, 2022",0,"I have been stuck in am anxiety/panic/psychosis episode since January 3 2022. I have yet to see a psychiatrist. I’m on a waiting list. My doctor advised me to up my dose of Venlafaxine XR from 75mg daily in the morning to 112.5mg’s daily in the morning. I’m only in day six. My anxiety has been quite a bit higher but I know that, that is pretty normal when upping the dose. I have been in denial about having an anxiety/panic/psychosis disorder for 11 years. Each time I have an episode as soon as I’m better I wean myself off all of the meds. This episode had made me realize that I need the medication to prevent these episodes. I’m in the worst part of taking this med. I was told to give it at least a month. It has pulled me out of a very dark place with God’s mercy as well 3 times before. I will come back and review in 2 to 3 weeks.",Honeybee
2,Venlafaxine,Panic Disorder,10.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"October 1, 2021",31,Effexor XR (venlafaxine):I have had panic attacks for many years along with agoraphobia. In August the attacks were unbearable and my NP put me on Sertraline. I was so ill and after three weeks said I would  not take it anymore. He then put me on Effexor which I was really uneasy taking because of the side effects I had read about. Well I am here to say it has been a miracle drug for me. I had no side effects starting it and noticed a major improvement the second week. Now I am almost a month in and no panic attacks or anxiety at all! This is major for me. Now I am working on getting out more and driving. Please if  you have major panic then this medication may be for you. Please Please give it a try. I am so very happy I did.,cricket

I thought I was never coming out of it. I was so scared . And a hot mess. I was first prescribed celexa. Didn't touch me, I felt no difference. I was then prescribed Effexor XR. Started at lowest dose and moved up to 150mg. And all I can say is its 2021 and I'll never forget the way I felt it was like the gates of heaven opened. Everything was lifted. . Everything seemed beautiful again. Colors were vibrant, the air smelled beautiful, the world looked the way it was supposed too when you're not lacking those neuro transmitters. I was saved. Completely and utterly saved. I took care of my baby stayed off work for 2 years with him and then went back to work. Did everything fun and exciting without any anxiety or panic.

I gradually got a little better through therapy but I hit a wall and couldn't make it any further than a minute down the street for months. I started venlafaxine and I've been on it for about a month now, and the difference was almost immediate. I'm so much happier, have much more energy and I'm finally able to go places!

9,Venlafaxine,Panic Disorder,9.0,Taken for 10 years or more,"March 29, 2021",4,"I have read a lot on here about how it saved peoples lives, and then reading a lot about side effects. Unlike SSRI's this was the only thing that worked for me at 17. I was on so many SSRI's and none of them had worked. My anxiety/panic became so terrible that I refused to even leave my house and I could barely even eat because I felt sick to my stomach on a constant basis. When I first started yes I felt worse, my anxiety went through the roof. I am so happy I listened and stuck with it because it saved my life. Withdrawal is bad, but you're supposed to take it daily, not skipping doses. My advice is to keep on it after the first trial although scary, your body gets used to it and it really can work its magic and help you.",Laur

My anxiety had gotten worse so I thought I'd try an SNRI instead of SSRI. After a week or two, I found myself to be jittery and even more anxious. The worst of all, I developed night time hallucinations where I'd wake up and believe I saw someone standing over me which was terrifying. I've had to sleep with a light on ever since. I talked to a psychiatrist and told me he would have never prescribed Effexor because it's the hardest drug to get off of, with the worst side effects of all the SNRI/SSRIs. As someone who did really well on Paroxetine, I didn't do well at all on Venlafaxine.",Bree

15,Venlafaxine,Panic Disorder,6.0,,"September 30, 2020",13,"Effexor XR (venlafaxine):I started Venlafaxine in July 2020 after having a series of terrible panic attacks. I eventually increased the dose to 150mg. The panic attacks were less severe since being on the medication and I only had them after increasing doses. Two reasons I got off of it: sex life diminished horribly and it increased my blood pressure. I was given Metoprolol to help with that and it just made me gain weight, while still having high blood pressure. I was put on Prozac (Fluoxetine) and I’ve got my sex life back and no more high blood pressure. I didn’t have withdrawal symptoms because my doctor had me take Prozac while tapering off Venlafaxine. I only tapered down to 75 mg from 150mg, I had forgotten a dose and just quit taking it altogether (while still on the Prozac). I was only on Venlafaxine a total of 2 1/2 months.

Every person’s body is unique and everybody responds to medicine different ways. However, effexor xr absolutely did not work for me. From day 1, it has caused more problems that it solved. Not only did it not help with my panic/anxiety disorder, but it made me get my period 3 times in 6 weeks and I only know this because every time my dosage was switched, I would get my period again which was also awful because I have PMDD. I’ve tried several medications. Last but not least, I’m currently coming off of it and the withdrawal is awful. I’ve been sick and throwing up for 2 days straight with HORRIBLE panic attacks and headaches. I’m super lethargic and honestly just feel like I have the flu and was told by my primary that it was all from stopping this medicine. Like I said, everybody is going to react different.

It has completely diminished my sex drive and I have developed anorgasmia. Very upset over that. I still get panic attacks but they’re very mild now and they last for minutes instead of two hours like they used to pre-treatment. Basically I can live my life again without the severe and frightening panic attacks anymore. I’ve heard the withdrawal symptoms are horrible even if you taper off.

I just need to get to the couch. Remember I'm crawling. Finally, she said you look so pale are you sure you're ok Mommy? I said yeah just need to get to the couch.

Eight years later I developed POTS and my anxiety, brain fog, panic attacks were terrible. Again I got on 10 mgs of effexor and needed to work up to the 37.5 mg pill.

However, the medicine ended up making me insanely depressed and apathetic. I'm currently weaning myself off it finally, I'd rather have panic attacks compared to feeling like this all the time. I'm down to 37.5 mg XR once daily and already feel SO MUCH better. Before weaning down all I wanted to do was sleep. I had absolutely no interest in doing the things I love anymore or spending time with my family. I had no feelings anymore, good or bad. I felt like I was just barely existing and going through life asleep all the time. It was no way to live. For anyone had has anxiety or panic disorder, do not let your doctor put you on high doses of meds like this, I believe it helps with the anxiety but the side effects and other consequences of taking this make it so much worse than living with anxiety in my opinion.",Wren

The Effexor has made a huge positive change.  I have tried 4 other meds to go with the Xanax and they all pretty much did nothing.  I guess the only drug that made me feel anything was Wellbutrin, but gosh I felt out of my dang mind on that stuff.Basically for me the Effexor is the perfect compliment to the Xanax and I don’t care if I have to take them for the rest of my life.  The yucky part about the Effexor is that I felt like I had the flu for about 3 days when I started it.  I also just felt off in general.  But I did have that magic moment people speak of when you start to feel normal.  The stuff may have saved me.  I finally felt the most normal I've ever been.
