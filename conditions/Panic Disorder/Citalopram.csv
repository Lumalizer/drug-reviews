0,Citalopram,Panic Disorder,10.0,,"March 23, 2022",1,I’m on day 20 of 10mg citalopram and would recommend this to anyone struggling with severe anxiety.  The only side effect I’ve had is tiredness and the odd headache. My back story is I’ve been crippled with anxiety for 3 months unable to even leave my bed every physical sensation from anxiety .  I couldn’t go out was literally physically sick every morning and didn’t see a point to going on. This medication has been the light at the end of the tunnel for me. I never take medicine and had a bad experience with sertraline in January which made me weary to take this. Now I can function again I know it’s only been 20 days but I can do my housework take the kids to school make dinners and actually relax. Please don’t Google side effects everyone is different but if your doctor has given you this then it’s worth a go it only took just over 2 weeks for this to start working my anxiety is still present but not on my mind 24/7 good luck to everyone on there journey.,CHH
1,Citalopram,Panic Disorder,7.0,,"March 3, 2022",0,"I suffered from severe, and I mean severe panic attacks, due to thoughts about the fact that I have to die at some point in the future. Additionally, I suffered from never-ending thought loops about my mortality, that intensified over the years, until I simply could not do anything anymore and simply lay on the couch, trembling with fear.I have to say, that, in my case, after 13 days, I experienced a slight, very slight improvement, a slight decrease of the mental torture. After four weeks, I could go on a walk again without immediately getting a panic attack.For citalopram to take full effect, it did take three months. Unfortunately, in the beginning, my sleep got worse. After three months, I could sleep much better. Weirdly enough, after six months, I got the opposite of sleeplessness, namely fatigue as a side effect. Therefore, I changed to a different SSRI. However, I don't regret taking cit. It took me from a place of utter, complete horror to a point where life felt tolerable.",Jesper Jansen
2,Citalopram,Panic Disorder,8.0,Taken for 5 to 10 years,"February 22, 2022",0,Started taking at 30 years old for newly developed panic disorder. Started at 10mg. Had worse anxiety attack for first couple weeks but didn't experience panic afterwards. After a year or two I developed side effect of random feeling of about to ejaculate. I didn't mess myself but thought I would. I dropped dose to 5mg and it seemed to work at least 80 to 90% as well with out having that side effect. I wouldn't get full blown attacks at 5mg. After seven years I stopped taking it since I did experience some emotional blunting and loss of libido at 5mg. Within 7 months of stopping the medicine the panic attacks came back. Mainly while driving on interstate. I was using 25mg benadryl to abort panic attacks at attack onset while not on this and it works well but makes me sleepy and after the fifth time or so I decided to go back on it  at 2.5mg. Been on it about a month with no panic attacks but some mild anxiety still when driving at times. I always keep a 25mg benadryl on me just in case.,39M 170lbs
3,Citalopram,Panic Disorder,,Taken for less than 1 month,"December 27, 2021",2,All of a sudden I started getting weird anxiety and panic attacks while driven it was so bad that I really couldn’t ride with anyone.  The dr performed all kind of test and didn’t find anything. I went for an eye exam and my vision was double as bad as very first exam.  The dr prescribed me citalopram 10 mg I kind of nervous to take them after I tried one the other day. I may try half of one at night.. has anyone had the anxiety panic attacks while driving? If so would you let me know how it was!!,Me02
4,Citalopram,Panic Disorder,8.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"December 17, 2021",4,"Hey guys, I have been on this forum so many times over the past few month so wanted to share my experience and hope it helps you. I was absolutely terrified of medication, always had anxiety but panic attacks became so bad I couldn't function, I was stuck in a cycle of fearing an attack, so having an attack. Anyway I was so scared I went onto 2.5mg yes just 2.5mg of citalopram for 1 week then up to 5mg then 7.5mg and now I am on 10mg. 5 weeks on the 10mg and I really do see a huge improvement. No panic attacks, very little racing thoughts. Side effects whilst tapering up were hot flashes, a day or two of crying, disturbed sleep, feeling spacey, dry throat, sweating. All got better over the first 7 to 10 days  when I increased to 10mg I had increased anxiety for the 1st week then that settled. I suffer from PMDD and this is the 1st month I actually didn't even realise when my period was coming because there was no increase in anxiety at all. Please stick with it. It does get better.

7,Citalopram,Panic Disorder,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"October 4, 2021",1,"I had to take some time off work due to panic attacks/anxiety and the inevitable following depression, by taking time off I mean I literally downed tools and left. Been suffering from severe anxiety the majority of my life and never sought help or treatment until I was on the brink. I was first prescribed sertraline and due to cognitive anxiety I had a very bad day to say the least which landed me in A+E. Sertraline has helped a lot of people from what I had read but it wasn't for me. Called my GP the next day and was prescribed Citalopram. I was nervous about it but reassured by friends who have also used the same drug. This is day 14 and I have never felt this way in years, it has been a miracle drug to me and lifted everything away with barely any side effects (bit of a headache prior to taking it) Everybody is different and will have different reactions to medication, but all I can say is that citralopram is doing what it says on the label for me and I'd recommend it",Keltaz

I’ve tried MANY other meds but couldn’t handle the side effects. My doctor started me on the the liquid 1 ml/2 mg and increase by 2mg each week until I reached 20mg.

9,Citalopram,Panic Disorder,9.0,,"June 21, 2021",16,"I started this because I was suffering from  bad social anxiety with panic attacks. Whenever I was in a social situation I would have a panic attack.   I am a 32 year old mom and I'm always being put in social situations and I knew I needed help. Going on this med was a huge challenge. For me it was an emotional roller coaster of increased anxiety, panic attacks for 2 months. I just completed week 9 and I know its working  now because  I was recently out and a mom came up to me and started talking with me. Normally I would have had a panic attack  with all the symptoms but guess what!? I didn't!!!! I talked to her for over an hour! I went to a crowded beach and had no anxiety. I walked around totally comfortable! It's working!  To anyone suffering from social anxiety... you CAN  do this!

11,Citalopram,Panic Disorder,9.0,,"April 6, 2021",20,"I’m 46 and I’ve taken citalopram before (many years ago) for anxiety/depression. This time I struggled with side effects for several weeks (mainly tiredness). But after persevering for 3 months I’m in a much better place. I feel positive - like a weight has been lifted off my shoulders. I can handle things that used to drag me down. I still get negative thoughts, but not as regularly, and when I do, I take it in my stride. I’m more relaxed generally and haven’t had any panic attacks... it’s a revelation. If you are considering taking this drug then all I can say is try to persevere for a few weeks. You have to give it time to bed in. I’ve wanted to throw the towel in a few times but stuck with it and life is so much better now. Now that I have my mojo back I am looking forward to things... I actually want to see people and feel motivated to exercise again (which I always find a great mood booster). If you are reading this... I wish you peace of mind. Take care x",Cat
12,Citalopram,Panic Disorder,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"March 27, 2021",6,"I have only been on this medication for about 2 weeks but I am already seeing improvements in my ability to cope and rationalize in moments of anxiety and panic. I'm currently taking 10mg and will be going up to 20mg starting next week and am looking forward to continuing this medication. I will mention that yes, the first week was tough with the side effects. Thankfully I was off from work, because my anxiety initially increased and I had nausea and an upset stomach every day, along with being generally more tired. My hypochondria got worse. Don't let this deter you from taking this medication. I am a highly anxious/panicky person and was able to get through it and am now feeling better than I have in months. I highly recommend this medication. I finally feel some hope for my future.",Phoebe
13,Citalopram,Panic Disorder,9.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"March 5, 2021",5,"Hello folks. For 17 long months I was psychologically in chronic shape. I feared life itself. I had continuous panic, anxiety attacks along with severe depression. 8 mths ago my dr put me on Cymbalta 30 mg, 2xs a day. I took them for 6 1/2 mths, and very little relief. I requested a switch  3weeks ago to Celexa, 20mg. I ended the Cymbalta a week now and I feel almost like my old self. My panic attacks have subsided tremendously. I barely have anxiety. I feel calm and my attacks are slowly disappearing. I'm not consumed with depression and racing thoughts. I'm finding me again and that is a comforting way to live, because before Celexa, it was not a way of life. I can only share my experience and pray that other people can relate that yall find solitude also. There is nothing worse than a broken spirit, 24/7. Best wishes to all!",Hopeful

I'm only on 10mg as I'm quite underweight and only 20 years old, but it reduced my anxiety so much that I'm now able to make myself leave the house for short periods of time with minimal anxiety. I used to have such severe panic attacks that lasted hours, I'd burn up, I couldn't breathe, I was so dizzy and nauseous and couldn't even bring myself to do anything but lie in bed and cry. This went on for 6 months until I started Citalopram. The side effects were absolutely horrible, it somehow made my anxiety even worse at first, and I was so nauseous and dizzy, blurred vision, dry mouth, constantly spacey. After two weeks the side effects reduced and after three weeks they were gone completely. My only issue with it now is that I'm still feeling a little spacey after being on them for around 6 months.",Sunflower
16,Citalopram,Panic Disorder,10.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"December 16, 2020",10,"I was hesitant for several years to try medication for my severe panic disorder. I had heard so many horror stories about antidepressants and their side effects. After six months of taking 20 mg of Celexa daily, I can definitively say that this medication has drastically changed my life for the better! I am lucky in that I have had absolutely zero side effects. I tell people all the time it feels as if the  volume dial of the panic inside of has been turned way down. Of course, I still experience anxiety from time to time, but it’s nothing in comparison to before starting Celexa. I find it so much easier to think through my panic rationally, and to just enjoy my life without feeling the weight of constant dread and terror.",Izy

In the last 4 years I experienced night terrors several times a week. I was reluctant to take medication as I was concerned of side effects. In March this year I had several hypertensive crisis, were my blood pressure was above 190 due to panic and I had to attend the emergency department and call an ambulance.I realised that I needed help as my life was spiralling out of control. Reluctantly in April I saw a psychiatrist that diagnosed panic disorder and prescribed 10 mg celexa. It took me three days to fill the script an another 3 before I took the first dose (crying) the first few days I experienced tiredness but a sense of calm. Slowly the doctor increased the dose to 20mg per day and the nightmares and anxiety have completely disappear after 3weeks on 20mg :)",Alexid

As I progressed through therapy I was placed on 40mg daily. The first few months were great, then all of a sudden I was panicking worse than before. I had rapid heart rate and breathing, sweating, and I was always irritated. Leaving home was a huge chore for me.

I had succumbed to a life of regular panic attacks for the last 5 years. Someone recommended Celexa and I swear this is the first time I have relief. Aside from a bit of brain fog and mild stomach upset the first 2 weeks I haven’t had any major side effects.  I haven’t wondered if I have some catastrophic illness or had a panic attack in over a month. Things that used to trigger me feel like a hazy afterthought. I am able to tackle other issues in my life because I am not at constant war with my own mind. I didn’t think I’d ever feel like myself again but this medication has truly given my life back.

I was prescribed propranolol (40mg) to take one tablet up to three times if need be. I only started taking one, and had to stop because they where making me ill. Couldn't sleep head aches which made me lie down all the time. So I stopped taking them. But instead of just having anxiety I felt totally worthless, emotional and feeling like I didn't want to be here anymore. Lucky for me I had my wife and family by my side every step of the way. So I went back to my GP in which he prescribed me citalopram (10mg) to be taking every morning. But I only opened the box and read the leaflet. So for four days now I've been bricking it to take them because I've got it in my head I'll will get all the side effects.

Weeks of not having the courage to take the tablets my doctor prescribed a short course of diazepam to take along side the tablets. I am on 10mg, for the first week I split the tablets in half to 5mg. Once I had started to take the correct dose I had no side effects apart from not being able to sleep for the first three weeks.

It’s worth it as they gave me a chance to start loving myself again.Pros:  - They lifted depression I didn't know I had. - Thoughts are slower and I catch myself being overly self-critical. - Not as irritable and don't care as much about little things. - Once the side effects stopped, panic was easier to cope with. Cons: - My initial side effects were tough. I pushed through as my panic disorder was just as bad in a different way. It was worth the effort for me, but everyone reacts differently. - Side effects during the first 6 weeks included: Very sweaty feet (weird I know). Heightened anxiety. Emotional numbness. Weird dreams. Feeling like I was losing my mind. DR/DP -Depersonalization-derealization disorder,.- Sex-related problems (vaginal dryness/tightness). - If I miss a pill I feel odd for days.",K Jones

Anxiety attacks were way worse, sweating from hands, insomnia, lost 15 lbs, had to stay home from work. Around the middle of week 3 I started to notice a slight improvement during certain times of the day. By week 4 I had gone from slightly agoraphobic to being able to get through an airport and onto a plane. I do feel a little bit zombie like sometimes - and still get bouts of dizziness - but overall after 4 weeks I feel like I went from a 0 to about an 8.

I'm so glad I stuck with it, it does help tremendously.  I had severe panic attacks and fear daily and could not function...out of nowhere when I turned 40. I'm so thankful for this medication, I tried everything natural first but it did not help.  Please do not fear it, it's there to help you.  Just know that it takes a long time to really work and a lot of endurance before it does.  U are not alone.",sunshine

You know I’m right because that was me for many years, scared to take that one tablet a day in fear of what might happen! But I did and I stuck with it and I’ve had the BEST 6 years of my life! So please please try it, if your scared make sure you have company with you as I found this helped me, try meditation- do everything you can to help relax whilst starting your meds.

Honestly, I've suffered with panic disorder for years and I've always had general anxiety too. At the start of the year my panic attacks were happening several times a day and I was very suicidal. My mum and Nan are both on citalopram (celexa) and recommended it to me. Not gonna lie, the first and second week was hard (started on 20mg) as my anxiety was heightened and my panic attacks were worse and I felt shattered all the time. But I'm now on week 4 and *touch wood* I haven't had a panic attack in almost 2 weeks, I no longer feel anxious and if I do start to feel anxious I can quickly get myself out of it.

However, after exactly a week these subsided and I am feeling much better in myself and my appetite has returned and I am putting the weight back on and anxiety has certainly decreased.

However, after a few minutes and deep breaths I returned to normal and haven't experienced this since. Does anyone have similar experiences to this with starting citalopram and the panic attack?

I consulted my doctor and she increased citalopram 20mg to 30 mg, again had side effects for 2 weeks, insomnia, peaked anxiety etc. Only thing that keeps me taking this medicine is the feedback here on the site, many people advised to ""Be there and don't give up on this medicine"" and I promised that time if I ever recovered because of this medicine I will come back and write a honest review.

It dulls everything down, squashes the dynamics.  So yes it helps with fending off panic attacks a bit, although not at first, but it turns me into someone else; a lack lustre drone.  I've found it better to have the dynamics back and deal with the panic attacks in different ways.  It deals with symptoms, not root causes.  Citalopram exacerbates my feelings of worthlessness that cause the attacks in the first place! I don't find panicless dullness to be of much help in the long run, but it can help short-term.

I had a few panic attacks which is a side effects initially ( the irony ) and also teeth clenching was pretty noticeable at first which calmed downI still get night sweats regularly which is definitely this medication.

Whatever you're feeling before the WEEK THREE of taking this is pretty much irrelevant to the review, as Celexa's effects take at least 3 weeks to work properly and for the side effects to ease/disappear. That said, the side effects can be awful at the start but once you're well into treatment this drug can be a literal life saver.

But due to a recent event that occurred about a month ago, my panic disorder and anxiety had become CRIPPLING. I could not get through my days without either worrying about a panic attack to the point where I cause one, or not even thinking about the panic attack and having it happen at any random time.It was getting to the point where I was living my days centered around trying to keep myself ""level,"" but also petrified that I was going to have another attack. I had constant racing thoughts. My doctor recommended an SSRI for me-Celexa (Citalopram). He prescribed 20mg pills. I would take 10mg at night for the first four days, and then after that I would take 20mg at night from then on.   I MADE THE MISTAKE OF RESEARCHING ALL OF THE POSSIBLE SIDE EFFECTS!!!! I completely understand researching a drug before you take it- but it is important to remember that a lot of people who have positive experiences most often do not write about it. It is the people who have negative experiences who will. I was PETRIFIED to take the drug b/c of the horror stories, until one day I realized that the side effects of the pill were worth it if it meant that I could have peaceful days. I took the first 10mg at night and had (and continue to have) a FANTASTIC sleep. I did not experience ANY nausea, no tightness of chest, no insomnia, no panic, no anxiety, NOTHING but a slight headache. It felt as though the pill gave me relief almost immediately. I have been on the pills for a little over two weeks. They have been a lifesaver for me!! I feel at peace. The racing, flooding thoughts have stopped. The panic attacks have been nonexistent.

It was to the point where I was avoiding almost everything just to reduce my chances of being anxious/panicked. I started it and I do NOT regret it. It took me about 1 month to feel ANY effect at all (So don't lose hope). But now, at 2 months, it just keeps getting better every day. I can say that I'm almost anxiety FREE! TRY THIS MEDICINE.","I did not beleive in drugs, but now I do!"

Then, my Dr. told me he had to take me back down to 40mg because a warning was released that anything over 40mg could cause a malfunction with the electrical signals in the heart.  I am back on 40mg and things are progressively getting back to where they were to start with.  I think I need to change medicines.",Anonymous

I have taken Zoloft and Paxil and with good results for years, but started having sexual dysfunction and was switched to citalopram. It stopped my crying spells but I feel like my depression is still there. I just cannot let out my feelings due to this medicine.  Only positive is that I can just barely manage to function sexually. I am really surprised to see all these good reviews on here as to how it made others less anxious and more positive and social and even drowsy as it has had the total opposite effect on me.",cant leave house

Besides panic disorder, I have some OCD and I am scared of taken medicine. So, when the doctor wanted me to try Celexa it took three months of therapy and hitting rock bottom before I took it. Well, 5 weeks later things are great. Virtually no panic attacks and it has reduce to obsessive compulsive disorder habits to a minimum. I did have loss of sex drive for the first three weeks, but I am back to normal now and my husband is happy. I was also very scared of gaining more weight. I gained 45 lbs on Lexapro but so far on Celexa I have lost 8 lbs. I hope this medicine never poops out on me.",anxiety4yrs

Panic attacks, head pressure, foggy head, pressure in my ear, nausea, dizziness, tingling appendages appeared literally from out of the blue became my life at 26 years old. I went to numerous Doctors who tested me for EVERYTHING. I managed with Xanax, which seemed to be the only thing that made me feel normal again for brief periods of time.  I just wasn't myself and I longed for my old life when I felt confidant and in control.  I didn't want to believe that it could all be in my mind and was convinced that I had some unknown disorder.  Finally, I went to a Psychiatrist who diagnosed me with Panic Disorder and GAD.  I was prescribed Celexa 20.  ",jaclynlala

Over the years I have been on other medications and was taken off after about a year.  I had got to the point that I was having chest pains and could not stand to be around people.  I did not want to leave the house.  This medication has worked wonders for me.  I enjoy being around people now and I no longer have chest pains and I no longer shake like I am freezing.  I would recommend Celexa to anyone that needs it.,Take it as prescribed

I switched to Celexa because Zoloft did not seem to be working anymore.  I have been on Celexa for 2 weeks and still feel anxious.  I am also suffering from insomnia and body jerks when I am trying to fall asleep.  I just found out I am pregnant so I had to stop taking Klonopin and I am weening off Celexa.  I am so excited about the pregnancy but so nervous about my panic and anxiety.  I am planning on intense cognitive therapy to help me through the next 9 months.  I pray for a healthy and panic free pregnancy!  Celexa did not seem to do the trick for me.,Anonymous

93,Citalopram,Panic Disorder,10.0,,"November 30, 2009",64,Celexa (citalopram):I have had panic attacks and anxiety and stress for over 10 years now. They tried everything until one Doctor put me on Xanax and it was such a relief for a while. Now I am up to 2mgs 3 times a day and my newest doctor put me on Celexa 6 months ago. There was some nausea at first like he said and sleepiness but it quit after a week or two and it so mellowed me out more. The attacks are less frequent and not near as bad. So for me a God send! I know everyone is different but I have not had one bad thought and can actually go out and shop and do things without worrying about an attack! The nausea was worth working through. Thank you Celexa! It sure helped me! ,Simbelmyne
