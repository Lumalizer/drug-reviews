2,Xanax,Panic Disorder,10.0,,"February 10, 2022",0,"I’ve been dealing with panic attacks for a couple of years. The first time I got them they drugged me so bad I sometimes didn't know what day it was. Changed work situation, worked on myself to control the attacks. I recently started to use xanax (1mg) again but not everyday cause you simply can’t they are to addictive, so I’m only taking them when I’m having an attack and this works perfect! I don’t drink caffeine, stopped smoking, lived healthier and that made it all better! I work full time, have a nice girlfriend who supported me and it all turned out fine. Don’t rely on xanax only, there are a couple of things a patient also needs to work on to get better",Kimosh
3,Xanax,Panic Disorder,9.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"January 29, 2022",0,I love this medication so much. I was prescribed 0.25 dosage since my panic disorders were sporadic and not daily. It was from an Urgent Care because I had got a very bad panic attack. It calmed me within half hour-1 hour. I honestly fell in love with how much it worked. It let me sleep easily since I have a problem with my sleep paralysis combining with my anxiety + panic. It helped me sleep without worries. But one side effect I noticed that made me so scared was that I couldn’t orgasm (I am a 19 yo girl) I honestly thought I had lost my ability to orgasm but regained that after I stopped taking xanax. Xanax has bad side effects for long term but when your having a very bad panic attack coming it doesn’t help to take one as long as it’s not very often!:),Aru

5,Xanax,Panic Disorder,10.0,Taken for 5 to 10 years,"January 16, 2022",2,"Xanax (alprazolam)  saved my life. Having some kind of psychosis attack for 3 days drove me to my doctor who immediately sent me to the E.R. I was on the verge of suicide. I was given Xanax and experienced immediate relief. Subsequent medical diagnosis was anxiety/ panic attack. Five years later I still  feel mentally healthy. I'm on a very low maintenance dose taken as needed and I can feel when it's needed . It is when I get that stinkin thinkin. The effects kick in quickly. My observation  my own conclusion is that this condition is a result of my advanced age. I do believe that God's Devine intervention has led me to this just as the apostle Paul suffered with ""a thorn in his side"". I don't advocate for otc availability of this drug as it is very powerful and easily abused. I am extremely concerned that the government will eventually make this medicine so strictly controlled that it will become almost impossible to get. Over the last 5 years it has become more and more tightly controlled.",Tex

Finally swallowed pride and talked to my Dr about my problem especially my feeling like having heart stress.  My heart Dr did full workup and stress test plus echo and ekgs. All good with heart and arteries.    My GP Dr thought I had anxiety and a couple panic attacks. These panic attacks made me want to call 911 because I felt I was having heart attack and gonna die.   Dr started me on Xanax.  .25 up to twice a day as needed.  What a life changer.   Some days I do not need it but on days with attacks/anxiety I take one .25 mg and within half hour-hour feel normal.

My own thought of this medication is I would not want to be on any other medication. About the Xanax, yes medication has helped me get through everyday  - helped with my mind the racing thoughts that never stop.  I am able to try to focus better and how to  slow down my thoughts. I'm able to sleep better. I would never want to go on a alternative different medication. When I'm on my medication I am able to socialize with others, I'm able to respond to people.

14,Xanax,Panic Disorder,10.0,Taken for 10 years or more,"August 3, 2021",3,"First time I took a dose of xanax, I was like 'omg this is how normal people feel!' because I'd had panic attacks and night terrors for 2 decades before that. I've taken .5 mg 2x a day for 30 years. No increase needed. No calling the dr for early refills, no ""losing"" my prescription, no other behavior of addiction. My body is dependent on it, but when I've tried to taper or quit, I've ended up in the ER w/ severe panic attacks + withdrawals.  I've tried numerous times because doctors tell me it's for short term only and that I'll become addicted and that I should wean off.My shrink is reducing his time working (or actually ditching me, personally, tbh) and I'm so scared. No one else wants to prescribe it. I guess I will go back to how I was before and never again feel how normal people feel. They treat me like I'm a criminal when I tell them how long I've taken it, and look at me as if they don't believe I've taken a low dose for so long.I feel undeserving of care.",CH
15,Xanax,Panic Disorder,9.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"July 5, 2021",5,"After a long period of abuse, I was diagnosed with a dissociative disorder and panic disorder when I was 14 years old. For the most part, all I had was panic attacks and periods of time missing in memory. Though, as time went along, I developed intense obsessive thought loops about worries that made no sense and would hyper-fixate on things such as breathing, death, etc. I saw many psychiatrists who tried putting me on SSRIs, SNRIs, TRIs, etc. None of them worked. When I was 16 I was given 0.25 mg of xanax to take 1-3 times a day, and it changed the world. It stops panic attacks, it helps group me during any moments of derealization, and whenever an obsessive thought loop starts, I begin taking it a few times a week until it tappers off. I don't usually ever take more than 1 within a month, though sometimes it does get a bit stressful, and never really had any withdrawal issues. I do get tired and spacey the next couple days after taking it, but its really no issue.",Kozy

Had anxiety and panic disorder 3 years earlier back in 2018.Was prescribed Zoloft 50mg and currently taking it same dosage. But still some days in a month are bad specially in evening times. I take Xanax 0.25 when needed usually 2-3 times in a month and in 30Minutes back to normal. Xanax is best for treating instant fear of panic attacks. You can only understand a panic attacks if you are someone  that has or had them. I recommend 0.25 xanax to anyone who have anxiety and panic disorder issues. This medicine really works,Sam Mookhi
17,Xanax,Panic Disorder,10.0,,"April 24, 2021",50,"Been on Xanax 4 years 1mg a day for intense panic attacks in the evening/night. Would wake up sweaty heart palpitating impending doom and vomiting nonstop. Also have CVS. Xanax worked great, also helped my TMJ. Never had to increase my dose in the 4 years I've been on it & never took more than the one pill a day I was prescribed. So tell me why now, all of the sudden my dr has taken me off of it?! After 3 days of not taking it I was twitching, vomiting, couldn't hold down water, TMJ pain, intense migraine and tinnitus. Called dr & told him I have a 5 year old child, cannot be bedridden all day! He called in a script but only 15 pills half my normal dose & said he couldn't give me anymore. His reasoning: ""You've been on it too long and you shouldn't need it anymore."" Xanax helps my panic attacks, TMJ, CVS, insomnia. Had given me my life back. No quality of life now. Guessing this is because of people who abuse them, they want to take people off who legit need it & don't abuse it.",Darling

After going to the hospital for a panic attack and seizure due to an overwhelming feeling of fear and worry, my psychiatrist prescribed 2mg once daily WHAT A DIFFERENCE. Listen, many people say it is an addictive drug.....which it can be if taken incorrectly.....however, if you have to take medicine for a heart condition, what is really the difference? The only people that don’t understand are the ones who have never suffered through a panic attack or had a moment of extreme anxiety - It can be very debilitating.

My dosage varies depending on the day or situation. Never more than 2 pills in one day. Somedays I don't even take it. However, if I don't take it for a couple days, I get irritable. I spoke with my new Dr about it and he assured me I was fine taking it as needed and once or twice a day. Just not to abuse it. I usually take it when I know I'll be in a situation where my anxiety can be high. This medication has literally allowed me to live a regular life.  After spending every other day in an ER for almost 2 years, it was a huge relief to finally find something that worked.  Sometimes I've considered slowly weaning off of it, but when I weigh the circumstances and the effects on not having it , I decided to just continue taking it as prescribed.

23,Xanax,Panic Disorder,9.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"January 13, 2021",11,"I wish my doc would return me to my previous Xanax 1mg tds script; I realise that the current Rx is, according to the books, twice the strength (clonazepam 2mg tds) but the truth is that I found the alprazolam, always dispensed as original Pfizer/Upjohn Xanax, much more efficacious. In between I was given lorazepam 2.5mg qds but found it too sedating. There is an advantage to Rivotril though - it's ""two birds, one stone"" in that it treats my epilepsy perfectly. It's just that Rivotril (clonazepam by Roche) doesn't feel like it treats acute anxiety and has far too long an onset of action though a long half-life suiting it for panic syndrome whilst the Upjohn Xanax rugby balls (footballs to our Yankee friends) treats both, 1mg being sufficient for most all acute situations as well as long term panic issues.Anyone agree with me on those questions?",minoguesque

I’ve tried a number of antidepressant and anxiety medications over the years that do indeed help, because without them I would never be able to leave my house. However, I still do get extremely anxious and have panic attacks. My new psychiatrist has actually been able to figure out my particular chemistry. She prescribed xanax for the panic attacks, which has helped tremendously. I only take 2mg when I’m having an attack. At most 15 minutes later, I feel twenty times better. My attacks can easily last hours so the xanax cuts that time greatly. Afterwards, I get sleepy and my concentration isn’t very good, but I’d much rather be calm & not be able to concentrate than to be panicking & feeling like I’m losing my mind & STILL not able to concentrate. I don’t see myself using it for years like some people have to because I do take Fetzima and Prozac daily, but for now it’s helping me so much!",Missy

29,Xanax,Panic Disorder,9.0,,"January 6, 2020",59,"This drug  Xanax does exactly what it’s supposed to do for panic attacks. It’s honestly the only prescribed drug I’ve ever taken that really fulfils what it says it will do. I’ve been taking this medicine for close to 20 years sometimes not for long periods of time but very steadily for about the past 7. I gave it nine stars bc it is super effective but has a good deal of drawbacks. For one, it’s crazy addicting. I feel I’m definitely addicted to it and start having very serious withdrawals if I skip a few days. Personally, I feel like it’s the lesser of two bad options being that not having it my life is just constant anxiety and panic but it creates its own anxiety knowing that you need it. I currently take 2 mg a day and sometimes I break it up throughout the day. If your anxiety is truly severe and strongly affecting your life I would recommend taking it but if that’s not the case I would use some discretion before getting involved with a drug as strong as this.",Beardman8511

I am also on 150mg of Zoloft, and hydroxizine for the evening to keep my anxiety down and help me sleep. They say this drug is very very addictive but my Psychiatrist said it’s hard to get addicted if you use it correctly and only as needed.

34,Xanax,Panic Disorder,10.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"November 1, 2019",34,"I take Xanax now and again for severe anxiety when I feel a panic attack is coming on. It works wonders and is a godsend. I am sensitive to meds so even 1.5 mg is enough for me to take. I wouldn't be taking this everyday for anxiety because you get used to it & then it won't work, so then you end up upping the dose and quantity which you'll end up addicted. It's only for short term use. I never take it after a panic attack cos it's already happened so that's pointless, unless I'm still crippled with anxiety or the panic doesn't stop. Now that I know it helps and it's there I get less panicky now because I know a xanax can stop it. I think that's a psychological thing for me. But it's amazing how it works. I could be totally panicky, nauseated, chronically worrying and just take one of these and 15 mins later I couldn't care less if the house fell down. Get the best nights sleep too.",Marjoree

Was able to lead a high-functioning life and hold down a 20-year high functioning career with the state. After this many years and all the reading that I have done and also my experience in working with psychiatric patients I understand what a benzodiazepine can do in my estimation it is The Most Dangerous Drug bar none to detox from. Because of the opiate epidemic it is being suggested to the medical community to also curtail use of benzodiazepines. If I came away with nothing from this post I hope to come away with the fact that doctors need to be educated as to the dangers removing patients from long-term benzodiazepine use without titrating,GG

Only in 2007 after much research I found out that all my  mental disorders are caused by lack of nutrients. Started taking nutrients supplements. It worked but unfortunately I had to stick to Xanax for quite a while until I can find a way to quit it altogether.

If I was prescribed it I flushed it down the toilet. I FINALLY took one when I was so desperate I didn’t have any other choice. I take 0.5 most days.  People take all kinds of medication for all kinds of other diseases. Anxiety and depression are a disease just the same as anything else.  It’s a shame that we are made to feel like we’re doing something wrong for using Xanax.   It has helped me control my anxiety and depression for about 8 years now. Without it I honestly don’t know what would have happened to me by now. It stops the terrible cycle of impending doom. It has kept me from going in to major anxiety and depression so many times I can’t count.  Mental problems are the hardest thing I’ve EVER dealt with in my life. I’m almost 45 and have been fighting this since be I was 18. Whoever you are I hope wholeheartedly that you find help and hold on.,Jen

This had a serious effect on my mental health and within 3 months I started having anxiety or panic attacks. I did not know what they were. It was all novel to me. After a few difficult months I went to a psychiatrist and he put me on alprazolam (Xanax) in a reduced dosage of 0.25 mg as necessary. It did provide serious relief. I take it no more than once a day at most. It was a life saver. Yet it deals with the symptoms of anxiety it doesn't resolve your underlying issues. Yet it was a fantastic help.

But there were definitely signs of a building anxiety disorder before that. As opposed to normal anxiety, which we should all try to cope with as best as possible without unnecessary drugs. But these attacks had become all-day, distracting, genuinely life-disrupting experiences, tense muscles, constant intrusive thoughts, inability to concentrate on other things, etc. At that point, there's something wrong, and it needs to be diagnosed. Xanax works like a tourniquet for your mind - and sometimes you just need that. It won't cure the underlying issues, but it'll give your mind space to recuperate.",Darren Ronard

I was on Clonazepam and that made me high and groggy but did not help anxiety. Xanax has worked perfectly, reduces my symptoms and no high feeling. The minute I get freaked and have racy thoughts (panic) it curbs it, then I can get on with my day. I have not noticed any side effects and my friends and family have seen improvement.",fishlove73
208,Xanax,Panic Disorder,,,"June 12, 2009",91,"It is a miracle. I was always against medicines, and thought that panic disorders were people who just worry and cry all the time until it happened to me- completely out of the blue in April after my dad had been diagnosed with cancer. The day after Easter I came home from work and just felt something coming over me. Light-headedness followed by tingling in my arms, legs, and hands. A few minutes later I was completely paralyzed, crippled and numb.  I had my boyfriend call 911 and they took me to the ER. It took me 4 hours to try to relax and calm down, and then the Xanax came to me. A few minutes later everything started to calm down. I had 3 more attacks that week. Now I am on 0.5mg, which I take when needed. Very effective. ",Finally

I developed severe PTSD during military service which was exacerbated by multiple sexual assaults in civilian life, and later military duty. Without this medication I don't know how I would have been able to function all these years. If you take Xanax, DO NOT attempt to combine it with Prozac. I took it and ended up in ER having a status panic episode (""adrenaline storm"") which I wouldn't wish on anybody. The Prozac was decreased and the Xanax increased. I haven't been able to successfully go back down to the previous low level dosage yet but we're hopeful. I got my life back the first day I took Xanax and have been doing well with it since.",Cinderspin
