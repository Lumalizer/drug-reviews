0,Klonopin,Panic Disorder,10.0,Taken for 10 years or more,"March 9, 2022",1,Only medication that gave me my life back by taking away my panic attacks from panic disorder. I've tried every other benzodiazepine and SSRI combination. Klonopin is the most effective and efficient for me. 1mg three times daily. Very easy to take. No negative side effects,John
1,Klonopin,Panic Disorder,10.0,,"March 9, 2022",0,"I have had severe anxiety my whole life. I work extremely hard and I am very successful at work because of my anxiety I am told. But when I am off work or not busy I have absolutely horrible panic attacks that have put me in the hospital. It makes me not want to go to the store, travel, do anything but try and stay calm. I would have heart palpitations, trouble breathing, stomach bloating. You name it, I had it. Klonopin took all those symptoms away. I take .5mg in the morning and 1mg at night. Sometimes I don't take it in the morning. I have used this drug in the past for a year and stopped cold turkey with no withdrawal because I was not feeling anxious anymore. This drug is great if you need it. Don't abuse it, take as prescribed and don't take it if you don't need it.",Rekkitrob
2,Klonopin,Panic Disorder,9.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"February 15, 2022",0,I’ve been taking Klonopin as needed since about December. I haven’t experienced any side effects and it has greatly decreased my symptoms of panic. I am prescribed .50 mg but sometime I only need .25mg. The only thing I would advise people to be cautious of is that it is extremely habit forming and shouldn’t be something you rely on for everyday use. TAKE IT ONLY WHEN REALLY NEEDED!,Anonymous
3,Klonopin,Panic Disorder,10.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"February 15, 2022",0,"I have severe PTSD and have taken this for about 3 years. 1 to just a half a tab at night. I've tried EMDR, Ketamine and a large amount of anti depressants. The dependency I understand but if your responsible and it helps so I can rest I don't see the problem. My primary just sends me off to mental health clinics and I do this circle again the same drug road with side effects to add and numerous doctor bills. To add some of these medications are not covered by insurance. I'm not 100% perfect and understand my disorder, why add insult to injury. I found a something that cuts through so I can sleep. The insurance company only allows me a limited amount at a time. I sleep ,I'm rested and take care of my responsibilities effectively. Without sleep life would be a nightmare. And just create more havoc on my body.",JKN
4,Klonopin,Panic Disorder,10.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"February 12, 2022",2,"I was always so anxious. I tried to take myself out. I was hospitalized and given antidepressants, they didn’t help until I got klonapin for my anxiety.  Now I am doing well sleeping and can handle life",Pauline
5,Klonopin,Panic Disorder,10.0,Taken for 5 to 10 years,"February 2, 2022",0,"I was put on this medication about 10 years ago I was taken only a quarter of .25mg for sleep anxiety it was such a small amount I didn't think much of it took it for a few years I even got off of it for a full year never had a problem. Then one day my world flipped upside down. Events in my life cause extreme anxiety which cost me to have zero sleep. I’ve heard so many bad things about Klonopin that I was scared to start it again. The doctors tried every SSRI, every sleep med and I went deeper deeper into crazy land. I ended up breaking down and taking .5mg a night, which I’ve stayed on that amount now for 5 years and it helps along with a half pill of unisom. I can’t take any ssri and at times I beat myself up about having to take it but it works so well for me. I did have issues with the generics so name brand only works well... I will probably be on them for life and right now I’m ok with that",Cole
6,Klonopin,Panic Disorder,8.0,Taken for 10 years or more,"January 18, 2022",0,"I don’t know how many years ago that I suffered from a severe panic attack but I can say it’s an awful experience and something I will never forget. I felt like an impending sense of doom come over me, my heart was racing, I’m pretty sure I was hyperventilating, felt like I was dying. The next day I was in my general practitioner’s office and he prescribed 2mg at bedtime and 1mg if needed. Rarely do I take the as needed as this drug keeps me on an even keel. I’m pretty sure I’ve had small panic attacks if there is such a thing but overall this drug has treated me well. Thank you Klonopin.",Rustynail
7,Klonopin,Panic Disorder,10.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"January 7, 2022",4,"This medication gave me back my life. It took me a long time to try it as there is an overwhelming stigma associated with benzodiazepines. I'm happy I finally caved as I'm back to enjoying life and raising my children as a healthy minded mother. I have GAD and Panic disorder. I had days I couldn't drive or shop, living was so much work. I've tried SSRI's witch only caused worsening symptoms. I take .5 2 x's daily (morning and night).",Game changer
8,Klonopin,Panic Disorder,8.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"January 6, 2022",0,"I've been taking this drug since Nov 2018 for general anxiety disorder. Started at 0.5mg at night and went up to 1mg at night in 2020. Most initial side effects go away within a couple weeks. I am dependent but not addicted. It makes me so tired, I have no desire to take it during daytime plus it has a long half life and manages my anxiety. I started off with Teva brand and then Accord in 2019 when Teva dropped the drug. Teva last month re-introduced its version and its not as good as the older version. I've swapped over to brand name at my own expense. It is worth the cost to have control of my anxiety. It doesn't work for everyone and I would exercise self control while taking it (no extra doses, alcohol, drugs, etc.). Also, it is technically not for insomnia so it won't help everyone with sleep issues.",Jackson
9,Klonopin,Panic Disorder,10.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"December 28, 2021",9,"I have been on klonopin .25 now for over 3 years. I was having bad panic attacks, anxiety, thoughts of just DOOM! I mean the worst. This hit me like a ton of bricks and for NO reason. I have been a nurse for 20 years. I had to quit my job, I quit driving, I lost 20 lbs that I didn’t need to due to nausea from anxiety attacks, always shaking, couldn’t sleep. Like my life went from one extreme to the next. Night waking, my body would go numb. Any pain or problem I thought I was dying. My Dr. Had me see a Psychiatrist because an SSRI she prescribed was not working at all. It actually made me worse. My Psych. prescribed me the klonopin for the attacks and I was to take it 2 x a day. I only take .25 once and it changed.my.life!!!! I mean changed my life!! I do not like taking medication, even Tylenol but I was at my wits end and I was desperate to get help. Diagnosed with GAD and panic disorder. Klonopin and other benzos get a bad reputation but IDC, if this helps me then I am taking it.",Jen
10,Klonopin,Panic Disorder,1.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"December 7, 2021",1,"Klonopin destroyed my life and damaged my whole family especially my young daughters. It was given to me for panic to take as needed. It does calm you quickly but at the highest price. Very real side effects include paranoia, fatigue, confusion, and impaired judgement. I made several terrible terrible business decisions while taking it. But the worst side effects come when you stop it. For me zero sleep insomnia, chest pain, fatigue, muscle loss, emotional emptiness, and SUICIDAL thoughts/acts that go on and on. It has been four months since my last dose and all I do is lay in bed.  My daughters are watching their once vibrant dad erode to nothing and I am helpless.",Sad dad
11,Klonopin,Panic Disorder,10.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"November 27, 2021",3,"Klonopin worked well for side effects of high dose fentanyl. Fentanyl and other opioids impart nervousness, insomnia and can trigger Serotonin Syndrome. Drugs.com is the premier interaction checker. I enlightened a physician that wrote me a prescription for amitriptyline and in combination with fentanyl I was hospitalized for severe seronotin syndrome. I lived after 48 hours in the ER. I dropped the amitriptyline and increased my Klonopin. I lived.",Chemist
12,Klonopin,Panic Disorder,10.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"November 12, 2021",2,"I'm prescribed to no take  more than 1mg per day as needed. Typically I take between 0 and 4mg per WEEK. Been on it for almost a year now. Taking it in this way has yielded zero negative results. I never get withdrawal symptoms the weeks and (on a very rare lucky month) I don't take it. At this dose, combined with the Effexor and Trazadone..... it's enough to end any panic attack within about 1 hour tops. I literally only take it when I have panic attacks. If you suffer from panic/anxiety and are OK using this only when you feel you really need it, it's a pretty good med. I don't doubt that those who are on ridiculous doses like 3MG+ per day will have withdrawal issues, as this IS a benzo after all. It also helps with my Autism symptomsI'd say this drug is excellent if all you need is a once-twice weekly emergency med. I have not experienced consistently daily doses so I have no input to that effect",metalmastodon

People have terrified me with the drug with such  negative results they've shared with me.  But nobody understands how this pill stops me from almost ending my life, I know it sounds crazy but until you actually know what a panic attack does to you, and your life, and my family suffers too watching me go through this But reading all these people on here has helped me mentally so much thank you",Richie

I am 73 and suffer from the sleep disorders that bedevil the ageing.  I have acid reflux and it calms my dry coughing. The arthritis that makes my legs ache is also lessened by klonopin. Klonopin is a miracle drug as far as I am concerned, and I am so grateful for it.",Aging female
15,Klonopin,Panic Disorder,9.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"September 28, 2021",4,"LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this drug. It is the most effective in terms of calming me down and allowing my personality to still come through. However, it is a benzo and not for long-term use (unless you're comfortable with a horrible withdrawal process or planning on taking it for the rest of your life). I always feel horrible the day after I've taken one - splitting headache and very irritable. If you've tried everything for your anxiety, or if you suffer from panic attacks, I highly recommend asking your doctor for a short term or as needed prescription.",sugartravelco
16,Klonopin,Panic Disorder,10.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"September 26, 2021",2,"When I developed severe panic disorder, I tried ativan. However  because my brain could feel when the medication took effect, it made me panic more. Klonopin was a life-saver! You don't notice it taking effect until it's already working and it was amazing! I took it daily for several months and then was able to just take it when needed. I wish this medication was not addictive, because I could have benefitted from it longer on a daily basis. But to be safe, I slowly dropped down frequency by 6 months.  I had no issues with drowsiness or impairment. I took it while I was on lexapro and I still carry its with me just in case, but my panic disorder has subsided to almost none.",Anonymous

I'm pretty sure Klonopin saved my life.  It definitely has helped me to continue working as a health care worker.  I know many physicians who take it and swear by it and that has always increased my confidence in using it long term.  I hope to one day not need it but why would I worry about using a medicine that makes me a better husband, father, neighbor and dentist?  Of all the benzos, its the only one I would take.  I take .5mg in the morning and .5 to 1.0 mg at night.  The drowsy effect wears off in weeks and I actually get a little surge of energy from it because I'm relaxed and mental outlook becomes more optimistic. This medicine has been a Godsend for me.",Christian

Most had terrible side affects. Finally I was prescribed Klonopin. What a lifesaver! The headaches, sweating, shaking and tightness in my chest stopped altogether. I could go through my day without having to sneak away to have a panic attack. I was on the verge of losing my job due to the panic attacks. For those who have tried all the anxiety meds offered with no steady relief, Klonopin may be an answer for you.",Kelly
19,Klonopin,Panic Disorder,1.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"August 7, 2021",3,"I was prescribed 1mg klonopin daily for 7 weeks. Some days I didn’t take even 0.5mg** I had went though some trauma and klonopin only made things worse, even though when I was on it it SEEMED like it made things better. Klonopin changed my personality to where I was TOO laid back.. after only being on this medication for 7 weeks I realized it was bad. I decided to come off from it thinking that since it’d only been less than 2 months I could do it cold turkey.. and I did do it cold turkey but not without an entire WEEK AND A HALF of misery. Withdrawal consisted of: no appetite, extreme panic attacks way worse than before, tremors/shaking/jerking, restless leg syndrome, the worst most disturbing nightmares in the world, uncontrollable crying, irrational panicking, ect. Do NOT take this medication and if you do please EDUCATE yourself. If it had not been for God and Jesus I would have been in the hospital coming off from klonopin, and I genuinely mean that.",DoNotRecommend

21,Klonopin,Panic Disorder,1.0,Taken for 10 years or more,"July 31, 2021",2,I thought I was going to be on this medication for life. For some reason I went off of it at a rehab clinic. I'm not so lucky since I don't take methadone. What am I supposed to do for the panic attacks? I was told to take a deep breath from my diaphragm.

22,Klonopin,Panic Disorder,10.0,,"July 18, 2021",19,I’m a 20 year old female who had suffered from extreme anxiety and panic disorder for 3 years. From crying all day and night to having to go to the hospital because I felt so out of touch with reality… As soon as I started on this medication the next day I woke up it felt as if my brain has factory reset I was able to get a job and start a healthy relationship with my friends and family again after being so closed off from being in the darkness of anxiety. Yes I do still get minor anxiety attacks and I always try techniques before my last choice as taking my mediation but Klonopin is the only thing that keeps me going! It saved me from feeling like I was losing my mind.,Rosa
23,Klonopin,Panic Disorder,10.0,,"July 14, 2021",55,"For years I've had obsessive worry and intrusive thoughts accompanied by recurrent and terrifying panic attacks and periods of dissociation. No medications ever worked for me. None of the SSRIs they gave me, none of the SNRIs they tried. Xanax didn't work for me, no matter how much I would take. Nothing would pull me from this dark and terrifying place. I could not have trains of thought, nothing could distract me. I felt as if I was watching my life go by from far away, looking through a foggy window. But after taking 0.25 MG of klonopin once, one single time, I was able to think again. I had trains of thought, I could forget the worry, I didn't panic. I can talk to people, I can travel, I can THINK AGAIN!! I don't have to take it everyday, either. It felt like a factory reset. Like I know there's hope now. I feel like my anxiety has no power over me anymore, but rather, for the first time, I have power of it. Klonopin saved my life.",vladimeow

They tried me on so many different meds until one doctor really took my anxiety cries for help seriously.  He put me on Klonopin.  I took my first dose the next day and within an hour (0.5 mg 2 x a day) the full anxiety disappeared.  That dreadful pounding in my chest and heart were gone.   I have had a drug/drinking issue and have been sober 10 years.  My doctor and I never had a problem worrying about addiction.  I don't take more than he prescribes.  I don't know what all the fuss about addiction is about.  All it does is help people stop feeling mentally and physically horrid.  Thumbs up to this medication!

27,Klonopin,Panic Disorder,9.0,,"February 4, 2021",83,"I was diagnosed with panic disorder in June and went through a rough period where I developed agoraphobia and thought I was losing my mind. I’ve dealt with depression and anxiety and had tried 7 antidepressants before developing panic disorder. While having panic disorder, I’ve tried four and the only medication that has not had side effects such as increased anxiety and severe stomach issues is Klonopin. Klonopin saved my life and allowed me to get back to being myself. I can now drive, hang out with friends, leave the house, work effectively and I haven’t noticed any side effects besides being a bit tired and occasional hot flashes (which I had already with PD.) It’s been five months now that I’ve been on 1mg and I haven’t had to increase the dose.

I have been on Klonopin (1mg 3x a day) for about a year. This medication really does help me calm down my nerves. Unlike other benzos I have tried in the past,  it does not make me as tired. Lately it has been making me a bit more drowsy than usual, and I think the only reason I’m feeling that as a side effect is because I’ve been losing weight and I am on other anti depressants.

Klonopin is great for me at preventing panic attacks as I normally get on average 4-5 per week instead of 20 or more before I started it. However, this medication has made me antisocial. I have intermittent explosive disorder now and it makes me aggressive and I have rage attacks. I take 10-12 mg per day.

SSRIs (and I tried them all) helped but not enough to get me on an even keel so as to function in the world. I was 24 when my psychiatrist put me on Klonopin. 9 years later I have a wonderful wife, a beautiful son, and a career that brings me great pride.   NONE of this would have been possible without the help I received from taking Klonopin. There’s a lot of bias against benzos and it is very true that they can be abused. But for people that truly need them, it’s a disservice to this potential life saver. It helped me take my life back. I’m grateful to have Klonopin in my tool box even to this day.

39,Klonopin,Panic Disorder,9.0,,"June 11, 2020",298,"Just because your particular biochemistry had a bad reaction, does not mean a certain drug is bad for everyone. Benzos get a bad rep because of their dependency nature. I will tell you that I have suffered with anxiety, OCD for many years. I have tried other medicines. They have bad side effects. I have tried natural alternatives, although they do work a little bit - it's only a little bit. The upside is they rarely have any side effects. So if you can have a natural supplement work for you, go that route. However I will say that I am someone that does not like to take pharm medicine and if I have the need for Klonopin, I only try to take it every few days or so. But I will tell you, when I do take it, it's absolutely the only thing that has worked. It does not make me feel weird, groggy or zombie-like.

Everyone is different of course and I have never felt the need to take more then necessary in fact I always try and take less.  SSRIs did nothing for me in fact they made me more anxious.  Any drug if taken too much or abused can cause you serious issues, also keep who your reviewers are me included, most people who have a bad experience will review, good experiences don't even think about doing a review.  I think the ratings would be closer to 9.5 if everyone took the time to write a review that was a positive one.  As we all know people are more likely  to comment when they have negative outcomes and that’s understandable.  People who take this medication also tend to have anxiety, panic, GAD like myself and can be very in touch with every perceived symptom within their body.  In my opinion way more then the average Joe walking down the street.  In other words take these reviews for what they are worth.  A single persons opinion and often a person that is suffering to find anything that will make them feel better.",Yogi19

In January my father passed away, another friend was murdered by a stalker and to top it all off I had to my cat of 21 years down. I found myself not wanting to go outside, getting panicky, etc. My doctor tried a host of medicines but the only thing that worked was klonopin and Adderall. Thank God for these medicines.",SKB In Col

258,Klonopin,Panic Disorder,10.0,,"March 23, 2008",135,"Works great to stop anxiety and panic attacks. I take the low dose 0.5 mg pill only when needed. However, after using it occasionally for 2 years, I feel I am a little emotionally dependent on it. If I'm out of these pills, I feel nervous. I would recommend using this pill only when in panic or anxiety and also learning other coping strategies, such as regular exercise, meditation, self-talk, yoga, crafts & artwork or something fun & productive, or a relaxing bubble bath!!!",happy chick
