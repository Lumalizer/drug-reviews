2,Alprazolam,Panic Disorder,10.0,,"February 10, 2022",0,"Xanax (alprazolam):I’ve been dealing with panic attacks for a couple of years. The first time I got them they drugged me so bad I sometimes didn't know what day it was. Changed work situation, worked on myself to control the attacks. I recently started to use xanax (1mg) again but not everyday cause you simply can’t they are to addictive, so I’m only taking them when I’m having an attack and this works perfect! I don’t drink caffeine, stopped smoking, lived healthier and that made it all better! I work full time, have a nice girlfriend who supported me and it all turned out fine. Don’t rely on xanax only, there are a couple of things a patient also needs to work on to get better",Kimosh
3,Alprazolam,Panic Disorder,9.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"January 29, 2022",0,Xanax (alprazolam):I love this medication so much. I was prescribed 0.25 dosage since my panic disorders were sporadic and not daily. It was from an Urgent Care because I had got a very bad panic attack. It calmed me within half hour-1 hour. I honestly fell in love with how much it worked. It let me sleep easily since I have a problem with my sleep paralysis combining with my anxiety + panic. It helped me sleep without worries. But one side effect I noticed that made me so scared was that I couldn’t orgasm (I am a 19 yo girl) I honestly thought I had lost my ability to orgasm but regained that after I stopped taking xanax. Xanax has bad side effects for long term but when your having a very bad panic attack coming it doesn’t help to take one as long as it’s not very often!:),Aru

Having some kind of psychosis attack for 3 days drove me to my doctor who immediately sent me to the E.R. I was on the verge of suicide. I was given Xanax and experienced immediate relief. Subsequent medical diagnosis was anxiety/ panic attack. Five years later I still  feel mentally healthy. I'm on a very low maintenance dose taken as needed and I can feel when it's needed . It is when I get that stinkin thinkin. The effects kick in quickly. My observation  my own conclusion is that this condition is a result of my advanced age. I do believe that God's Devine intervention has led me to this just as the apostle Paul suffered with ""a thorn in his side"". I don't advocate for otc availability of this drug as it is very powerful and easily abused. I am extremely concerned that the government will eventually make this medicine so strictly controlled that it will become almost impossible to get. Over the last 5 years it has become more and more tightly controlled.",Tex

Finally swallowed pride and talked to my Dr about my problem especially my feeling like having heart stress.  My heart Dr did full workup and stress test plus echo and ekgs. All good with heart and arteries.    My GP Dr thought I had anxiety and a couple panic attacks. These panic attacks made me want to call 911 because I felt I was having heart attack and gonna die.   Dr started me on Xanax.  .25 up to twice a day as needed.  What a life changer.   Some days I do not need it but on days with attacks/anxiety I take one .25 mg and within half hour-hour feel normal.

I've taken .5 mg 2x a day for 30 years. No increase needed. No calling the dr for early refills, no ""losing"" my prescription, no other behavior of addiction. My body is dependent on it, but when I've tried to taper or quit, I've ended up in the ER w/ severe panic attacks + withdrawals.  I've tried numerous times because doctors tell me it's for short term only and that I'll become addicted and that I should wean off.My shrink is reducing his time working (or actually ditching me, personally, tbh) and I'm so scared. No one else wants to prescribe it. I guess I will go back to how I was before and never again feel how normal people feel.

21,Alprazolam,Panic Disorder,9.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"July 5, 2021",5,"Xanax (alprazolam):After a long period of abuse, I was diagnosed with a dissociative disorder and panic disorder when I was 14 years old. For the most part, all I had was panic attacks and periods of time missing in memory. Though, as time went along, I developed intense obsessive thought loops about worries that made no sense and would hyper-fixate on things such as breathing, death, etc. I saw many psychiatrists who tried putting me on SSRIs, SNRIs, TRIs, etc. None of them worked. When I was 16 I was given 0.25 mg of xanax to take 1-3 times a day, and it changed the world. It stops panic attacks, it helps group me during any moments of derealization, and whenever an obsessive thought loop starts, I begin taking it a few times a week until it tappers off. I don't usually ever take more than 1 within a month, though sometimes it does get a bit stressful, and never really had any withdrawal issues. I do get tired and spacey the next couple days after taking it, but its really no issue.",Kozy
22,Alprazolam,Panic Disorder,10.0,,"July 5, 2021",2,"Since I was 13 I’ve had severe depression coupled with the usual debilitating anxiety. I wouldn’t socialize and had zero motivation.  This drug in the past three years has shot up in popularity in the streets with fake tablets containing other harmful drugs. Holly wood stars have abused it and ODed . So called recovery experts have shunned it, saying it doesn’t fix any thing and you are only delaying the root cause. While some of this MAY be true, for people like me who have a legitimate mental condition, and have tried EVERY thing, it couldn’t be further from the truth. Since being on alprazolam I’ve been able to LIVE life. I can talk and be a normal human, not to mention SLEEP !!! It also helps with my severe depression. It truly frustrates me on so many levels how unfairly this drug is now ostracized. And doctors are a real pain and are extremely stubborn. But I think the worst offenders are recovery experts.",Neil
23,Alprazolam,Panic Disorder,9.0,Taken for 10 years or more,"June 12, 2021",4,"This medicine is a blessing from God for panic disorder. It works immediately whereas other benzodiazepines take too long to work if you are having a bad panic attack. I have never been addicted to Xanax or suffered withdrawals because I am careful to taper off if I take it or any benzodiazepine for more than a week. I am prescribed .5mg and that’s all I need for panic disorder or insomnia. I was once prescribed  30-1mg per month and I never once got addicted or had problems with it. I do not get cravings for it Xanax really should be an OTC drug because all people should have access to it like they do to alcohol or to Ibuprofen. It is very helpful for occasional insomnia, anxiety, restlessness and it was miraculous how it remediated the panic from claustrophobia while scuba diving in Indonesia. On the down side, It can cause some short term memory issues and it isn’t all that great for insomnia.",MarTheophilus

I take Xanax 0.25 when needed usually 2-3 times in a month and in 30Minutes back to normal. Xanax is best for treating instant fear of panic attacks.

Also want to say shame on the ones of you for talking about the horror stories of withdrawal, that it is so bad for you and benzos ruin your life. Your horror stories stopped me from taking the med when I got it, which made me suffer longer. Withdrawal DOES not happen to everyone. Did you ever think about the fact that some people can't take antidepressants, or other options? Some of us have to rely on therapy and benzos.  Don't go  scaring the people who clearly need the medicine. Please... just take the med if prescribed and get a Dr you trust.

After 3 days of not taking it I was twitching, vomiting, couldn't hold down water, TMJ pain, intense migraine and tinnitus. Called dr & told him I have a 5 year old child, cannot be bedridden all day! He called in a script but only 15 pills half my normal dose & said he couldn't give me anymore. His reasoning: ""You've been on it too long and you shouldn't need it anymore."" Xanax helps my panic attacks, TMJ, CVS, insomnia. Had given me my life back. No quality of life now.

It completely diminished anxiety and social phobias. I became the biggest intellectual while taking this medication. However, it is very strong, you do get tired, and at times, at higher doses, you loose your inhibitions. It becomes possible to partake in risky behavior as well. Nonetheless, I was not always fond of the feelings provided by benzodiazepines. My addiction was to opiates and I never felt euphoric from Alprazolam XR so I did not take them regularly or become addicted. I only took them when I felt I was having a panic attack or an anxiety issue. I have read Alprazolam XR is hard to kick. I advise you do not take this medication more than two or three times a month and even that is pushing it.

In between I was given lorazepam 2.5mg qds but found it too sedating. There is an advantage to Rivotril though - it's ""two birds, one stone"" in that it treats my epilepsy perfectly. It's just that Rivotril (clonazepam by Roche) doesn't feel like it treats acute anxiety and has far too long an onset of action though a long half-life suiting it for panic syndrome whilst the Upjohn Xanax rugby balls (footballs to our Yankee friends) treats both, 1mg being sufficient for most all acute situations as well as long term panic issues.Anyone agree with me on those questions?",minoguesque

The bottom line is, yes, this medication works. For me it takes that constant knot in my stomach go away, and I can unclench for a few hours, and just feel, normal. However, I would say constant self-monitoring is needed for addiction potential. Because it really does work, but for me, it's so fast acting and it leaves your body so quickly, sometimes I do think about taking another dose do get that feeling again. But luckily I never give in, due to fear of addiction. I don't think it's a cure, and personally it was given to me as an add-on to my SSRI for the GAD, and this medication is strictly for when my anxiety is at high levels.

And taking it when u don't feel panic is not the way to go. Trust me! Prayer and a lil help from xanax can make all the difference in the world!!",Mannyvic
