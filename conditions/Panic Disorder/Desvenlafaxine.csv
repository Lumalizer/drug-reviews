0,Desvenlafaxine,Panic Disorder,8,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"January 10, 2022",0,"After four years of virtually no panic or anxiety symptoms at all, started suffering from panic attacks and severe anxiety in October 2021. Doc put me on 25mg of Pristiq. I had never been on an SNRI before, only SSRIs such as Lexapro and Zoloft. The first three weeks were very difficult, I must admit. Felt extreme anxiety, had little appetite (I usually LOVE to eat!) and dry mouth. Got to the point where I almost wanted to stop Pristiq, but decided to push through. Thankfully, I did. After three weeks, started feeling like 'myself' again. Started eating out, attending sporting events, and even taking trips out of town again. Any of these were almost unthinkable during my lowest times before I got help. I know everyone responds to meds differently, but I would say to stick with Pristiq for a few weeks before giving up. The doctor said he wanted me to give it a chance for at least four weeks, but three weeks seems to have been the magic number for me.",Rory
1,Desvenlafaxine,Panic Disorder,4,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"January 31, 2021",0,"A cardiologist prescribed this to me as my first drug in the world of antidepressants, and it did almost nothing for my anxiety/PD, maybe it made it worse. At first I didn't pay attention to the side effects, I think I just had a little dizzy, but it didn't do anything positive for me.",Gustavo Bldn
2,Desvenlafaxine,Panic Disorder,9,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"February 8, 2020",6,"I’ve been on generic  desvenlafaxine brand for 6 months  for panic disorder and social anxiety and it has helped me tremendously.  I went from experiencing horrible panic episodes almost daily with spiralling anxiety, to a whole new world.  I feel like a new person.  Also doing therapy and working on mindfulness.  This drug has been a life saver for me.  Few side affects that do not compare to the horror if anxiety and panic beforehand.  Side affects are slight tightness of jaw, slight weight gain (but previously underweight), slight sleep interruption mostly when I had started medicine-has since improved.",Hope
3,Desvenlafaxine,Panic Disorder,5,Taken for less than 1 month,"October 21, 2019",3,"I have anxiety & panic attacks for over 20 years now, & I have tried on Zoloft & Effexor but after several years they worn out.So this time the Dr. want me to try this Desvenlafaxine I’ve been on this medicine for a week now, but I don't feel the affect yet, I want to think that this medicine will work for me. Base on the other reviews, it makes me feel scared but still hopeful that this one could be the right one for me. I still feel anxious, shortness of breath, couldn’t sleep, groggy & less panic attack so far. Hopefully as I continue to take this medicine, it will work & bring me back to my normal life again.",queenmarbs
4,Desvenlafaxine,Panic Disorder,5,Taken for less than 1 month,"August 17, 2019",4,"So I’ve been on pristiq for about a month now and I take 25mg in the morning. I’m super weight conscious and I’ve stayed in between 102-105 pounds for over a year. I just weighed myself and I’m now 112 and I don’t know how I got here. I have an almost insatiable appetite I never feel full anymore, and I used to only eat once a day. I have enjoyed not panicking every other day. But all I ever feel instead is tired, and bored and quiet.",kat
5,Desvenlafaxine,Panic Disorder,1,Taken for less than 1 month,"July 29, 2019",2,"Do not EVER take this medicine. I ended up in the ER and was in and out of consciousness and I felt weirder than I’ve ever felt in my life. My dose was way too high at 50 mg which is the standard dose. I sharing my story so that others will know the effects of this terrible drug. The hospital told me to quit taking it immediately and that this was one of the worst ones I could’ve taken. I’m still not 100% and still can’t see good out of my eyes or stand on my own. I also didn’t eat for a solid day which is very unlike me! I just couldn’t. My motor skills were way off. I’m telling you, I’ve had a time with this medicine and I only. Took it once.",EmilyAlwayz
6,Desvenlafaxine,Panic Disorder,10,Taken for less than 1 month,"December 19, 2018",10,"Oh my goodness, so excited!!! Nothing worked for me ever! Venlafaxine made me unconscious, pass out, break out in rash and felt awful, did the DNA testing, prestiq came up, didn't think it would ever work, being a sister of effexor, yes just started, but I'm so hoping it stays great for me, not any side effects at all",Sharbear
7,Desvenlafaxine,Panic Disorder,9,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"November 17, 2016",13,"I started taking Pristiq after suffering from Panic Disorder for almost 3 years. I was terrified to take anything but it was the best decision I ever made. It completely cured me from panic attacks, but I am still anxious and my psoriaisis did not improve at all. I did NOT have ANY side effects ever. I even drink alcohol and I feel as if I am not on a prescription drug. It got rid of my agarophobia, and I felt normal again. I stopped taking it about 2 months ago but I felt terrified panic would come back. I started taking it again today. My doctor says even if I get pregnant I shouldn",cdrido
8,Desvenlafaxine,Panic Disorder,10,Taken for less than 1 month,"September 17, 2012",19,Pristiq (desvenlafaxine):I have been taking this same dosage 50 mg for 3 weeks and I take Xanax 3 times a day for anxiety/panic.  Its been so far so good. I'm really trying to be optimistic about this one.,pisces1981
9,Desvenlafaxine,Panic Disorder,8,,"December 23, 2011",13,"Pristiq (desvenlafaxine):I take 100 mg. It works but side effects were I was always tired and gained weight. Took Wellbutrin with it when I was taking 50mg. That made me feel close to normal but I got headaches and gained weight. I was good enough with just the Pristiq, but not great. The doctor then added Dextroamphetamine, which now has me feeling normal, like when I was in my 20's. I have motivation, energy, focus, no panic, no depression and once again feel the wide range of emotions as they are meant to feel. I am able to take joy in the small things in life and not dwell on the down sides. My weight has also adjusted back to pre-medication size.",Anonymous
10,Desvenlafaxine,Panic Disorder,10,,"August 11, 2011",8,"Pristiq (desvenlafaxine):I've been dealing with panic disorder/anxiety since I was 11-12 years old and have basically tried everything out there. While I was medication free for almost two years, I recently started having severe panic attacks again and subsequently was suffering from agoraphobia. My doctor put me on Klonopin (which I had used successfully in the past) but a friend with similar issues recommended Pristiq. I am currently taking 1mg of Klonopin 4 times a day (max dose for panic disorders), 10mg of Ambien at night to sleep and recently increased the Pristiq to 100mg.While I still have a way to go, I feel worlds better and certainly much better than on any other medication that I have ever taken.",Anonymous
11,Desvenlafaxine,Panic Disorder,4,,"September 6, 2010",10,"Pristiq (desvenlafaxine):Pristiq did a good job reducing my symptoms dramatically. However, it gave me so much in return, which made my life complicated! I mean 50 lb weight gains over a year that keeps growing every month. I also cannot sleep at night as I could before. I see very vivid dreams and nightmares almost every night! It makes me wake up feeling tired. In addition, I had withdrawal symptoms when I once forgot to take my dose. I had vertigo, nausea, headache. I absolutely could not function. ",Anonymous
12,Desvenlafaxine,Panic Disorder,8,,"July 16, 2010",9,"Pristiq (desvenlafaxine):I have been on pretty much every anti-depressant out there for the last 7 years.  The last few were Lexapro 20 mg, then switched to Zoloft, which made me feel like I wasn't on anything at all and I began having anxiety which turned into panic attacks. I was put on Ativan 1.5 mg a day and 20 mg Paxil, which was raised to 40mg.  This past year I was diagnosed with ADD, so Adderall XR was added....can't remember the dose because I had an allergic reaction, and moved on to Focalin XR.  I thought they both worked very well.  I was totally on target, focused and awake. However my jaw felt clenched a lot which gave me headaches. I saw a new PCP last week who put me on Pristiq and took me off everything else. It makes me so sleepy, but so far so good!",dakiddo311
13,Desvenlafaxine,Panic Disorder,7,,"March 21, 2010",10,Pristiq (desvenlafaxine):Did an amazing job at getting me back to normal although I still suffer from panic attacks in my sleep. This also helped me greatly with my depression and made me feel normal again. ,Anonymous
14,Desvenlafaxine,Panic Disorder,8,,"April 14, 2009",25,Pristiq (desvenlafaxine):I have suffered from panic disorders for eight years. I have taken everything there is and nothing has seemed to work. Zoloft helped take the edge off but it gave me sexual side effects and kind of made me numb. Pristiq is the best thing ever. I noticed almost immediately that it was working. The first week was rough and I felt a little more anxious. The only side effects I have are like at night I sometimes see halos around lights and I urinate a lot more often. But I feel great I have only had two panic attacks compared to having one everyday. I have only been taking Pristiq for a month. Thank you to the makers of Wyeth I have my life back.,Anonymous
