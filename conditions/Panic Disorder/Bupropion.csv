0,Bupropion,Panic Disorder,2.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"November 16, 2021",2,"Everything I’m seeing online says Wellbutrin is suppose to increase sexual function but that has not been the case for me. I started taking Wellbutrin in place of lexapro for anxiety and panic disorder. I’m going on two months of taking this medication and so far it has impacted me the same way lexapro has. It makes me feel apathetic towards everything, delays my ability to orgasm and to get an erection. I’m 28 and never had these issues until I took anti depressants to try and help with my anxiety . I think I’m done with anti depressants for good.",Nick
1,Bupropion,Panic Disorder,10.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"September 7, 2021",4,I have taken 150mg for about a year now once daily in the morning. I have panic disorder and was on Paxil for 2 years and gained 50 pounds. The weight wasn’t going anywhere. My doctor prescribed Wellbutrin since I gained so much weight and wanted to get off Paxil. I stressed I don’t want to rely on a medication to help me feel normal. This past year I had my wedding coming up and I felt really deflated since I gained so much. I was originally put on 300mg per day but it made my panic attacks worse (I tried it for a month) so my doctor switched to the 150mg per day. It’s been a year and I’ve lost 54 pounds and my anxiety and panic attacks are not bad at all. I have a strong dislike for taking medicine and always have. So my goal is to eventually get off this medicine. I like that it gives me a clear head and I can feel the anxiety instead of being numb to everything. I have learned how to cope with my anxiety and have been able to figure out what works for me.,KayMick
2,Bupropion,Panic Disorder,1.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"August 22, 2021",2,"I got panic attacks after I started with 300 mg bupropion, first when I started at 150 mg I felt very nervous for the first weeks and when I started with 300mg I started to get heart palpations and I had 2 panic attacks in 1 week (overall I had 5 panic attacks within month until I lowered the dose) I never had panics attacks before this, so I stopped taking the 300 mg and took 150mg again. The panic attacks stopped but, so me and my doctor decided to start at 300 mg again and it I got some heart palpations back again but it wasn't that bad, so for a month I took it without a panic attack, allI got what some heart palpations again.But now I am getting  panic attacks again, 2 times, brupropion seems to make me more sensetive to stress and caffeine, because I cannot drink much coffee now. Before I would drink 3 cups a day, now I have only one cup, because if I take more than that  will be nervous and get heart palpations, same if I go out and drink 3 beers, then I will get heart palpations.",Panic attacks
3,Bupropion,Panic Disorder,10.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"August 10, 2021",7,I got a Genesight test done to verify what I was taking was appropriate for my genes and I have Panic Disorder and Anxiety. I've tried 9 SSRIs which made things worse so my Dr. suggested trying Wellbutrin since it's different. It's been great I'm focused and I'm calm. I had nausea and drowsiness for the first 2 weeks and then again when my cycle would start. It's been 10 months and I can do things I used to not do and I have more confidence.,aperson

5,Bupropion,Panic Disorder,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"September 30, 2020",29,"Suffered from panic disorder, major depression, ADD, and severe generalized anxiety. I had horrible experiences with SSRIs- Zoloft, Prozac, Lexapro and Adderall. Finally decided to give Wellbutrin a try, and I feel more relaxed, less irritable, happy, energetic, anxiety is significantly decreased, and my migraines and back pain have decreased. I've lost weight and also have a decrease in nightmares. As far as side effects, I am way more thirsty, have mild nausea after I eat, and experienced cold clammy hands/feet the first 2 days. I'll take the side effects over the anxiety and panic attacks any day.",L.P.
6,Bupropion,Panic Disorder,10.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"August 28, 2020",16,"I was prescribed Wellbutrin for panic disorder along with depression, my Dr. Also said it would help me quit smoking.  I loved Wellbutrin, I felt 10x better, and I also lost about 10 lbs in a mater of 2 months.  If it wasn't for the hair loss I would still be on it.",9dee9
7,Bupropion,Panic Disorder,6.0,,"August 9, 2019",11,I've had very bad experiences with SSRI's. Mainly with Weight gain and sexual side effects. I experienced none of these issues with Wellbutrin. I ended up dropping it however as I started to notice early  after taking it my heart rate would be insane and I felt ready to run through a wall. Not a pleasant feeling when you deal with a panic disorder. If I could not have that side effect I'd much more prefer this drug.,JesseRae89

9,Bupropion,Panic Disorder,9.0,Taken for 10 years or more,"March 26, 2019",14,"I've been taking Bupropion for over 15 years with excellent results but the last time I filled my prescription the pill had changed from white to purple with the SG175 (brand = ScieGen Pharmaceuticals, Inc) and now my night time panic attacks have returned. I'm not sure whether this is due to the change in the pill or just that it's time to increase my dosage since taking it so long. I wonder if anyone else has experienced a difference with this new purple Bupropion?",Nancels

11,Bupropion,Panic Disorder,,Taken for 5 to 10 years,"November 27, 2017",8,"This medication helped my ADD for years. I actually started taking it for panic attacks and it helped my ADD so much it was astounding. I have taken it for years.  Now it gives me hot flashes.  I am 51 and when I quit taking it, hot flashes gone....but I really feel the lack of focus now.  Don't know what to do but I can't take the hot flashes...they were keeping me awake all night.",GaitedGurl

I'm not seeing any Beginning This Drug stories so I'm adding mine!I have borderline and complex-ptsd, as well as some undiagnosed odds and ends of symptoms (delusions and hallucinations). -day 1 hit me like a truck.

13,Bupropion,Panic Disorder,,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"June 7, 2017",41,"I have been on this medication for two months now and I see a big improvement in myself.  I was having minor panic attacks from time to time and I was also depressed and lethargic.  I was doing absolutely nothing around my home, just going to work and doing nothing else.  Now, I have been working harder at fixing things around the home and I even started watching TV with my wife, even the TV shows that I think suck.",Iver Biggen

15,Bupropion,Panic Disorder,8.0,,"February 22, 2016",15,"After having a horrible reaction to a SSRI ,celexa in my case. My dr put me on bupropion 150 XL. Wow I have so much energy only been 3 days on but already losing weight. Enjoying hiking again working on truck and way more intense on playing video games. Seems as if I'm getting my life back. However I go through these foggy periods. They only last about a hour and I feel normal again even giddy. I honestly look forward to my next dose which is a little worrying but I don't abuse any medication so I'm not to worried lol if that makes sense.",Doober1234
16,Bupropion,Panic Disorder,6.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"November 8, 2013",16,"I was prescribed Wellbutrin XL 300mg after being on Cipralex 30mg for 6 months.  I noticed an immediate improvement in my mood, energy level and libido.  As with Cipralex I have had to get used to problems with falling asleep but I remedied this by taking the medication in the morning.  Normally I would not have/remember dreams.  Now I have such vivid and bizarre dreams that they are down right frightening or just weird.  Waking can be fun as well.  If I am woken up by a phone call, really disorientated.  Woke up randomly one night and didn't recognize my partner for long enough for it to be scary.  It helped me to be positive but it did not help my anxiety enough for me to be ""normal"".  At least I am positive about it not working for that.",Boiled Frogs.
17,Bupropion,Panic Disorder,10.0,,"August 29, 2011",189,"Wellbutrin SR (bupropion):Before I started Wellbutrin SR, I had a severe panic disorder.  I was prescribed Wellbutrin for another reason, but one side effect of it was to completely get rid of my panic attacks.  I had a fear of driving over bridges,  high places, and just driving. It has been a few years and I now see how unreasonable I was being and how my brain was overreacting.  If anyone is having  a problem with panic attacks, I would recommend to at least give Wellbutrin a try.",donnataylor
18,Bupropion,Panic Disorder,7.0,,"August 12, 2011",43,Wellbutrin (bupropion):Today is my second day and I feel okay.  I am in transition from Celexa to Wellbutrin XL.  I take Wellbutrin XL 150mg in the morning and Celexa 10mg in the evening.  The only main noticeable side effects are I am a little anxious and I have stomach cramps.  They are not terrible though.  I expect to have some transition period.  I know it sounds crazy but I lost 1 pound in the 1st day I took it. Celexa put 10 -15 lbs on me that I cannot take off even with exercise.  I will keep you updated!,ShookJohansen
19,Bupropion,Panic Disorder,9.0,,"September 2, 2010",106,"Wellbutrin SR (bupropion):I started taking Wellbutrin SR about 2 weeks ago and I am already noticing a difference.  I had a lot of anger, frustration, stress, and small panic attacks with uncontrollable crying.  Now since I have been taking it, I am much calmer and I am able to determine what is worth worrying about and what is not.  I could not do that before.  The crying has stopped and I no longer feel stressed or angry.  The only side effect I have is a mild headache, a little insomnia, and extreme thirst.  Those I can deal with versus what I was dealing with.  I am definitely going to keep taking it.",HappierNLife

21,Bupropion,Panic Disorder,8.0,,"December 2, 2009",211,"Wellbutrin (bupropion):I started taking Wellbutrin after gaining 10 to 15 pounds on Paxil.  I'd already tried Prozac.  Wellbutrin did give me some uncomfortable side effects like ringing in the ears, sleepless nights and I did have a lot of panic attacks while I was getting started.  So I had to take Zoloft with it for awhile, which canceled out my sex life.  Now that I'm only on the Wellbutrin I've lost 10 lbs and my sex life is better than ever.  No one drug works for everybody keep trying till you find the right one, don't suffer!  My doctor choose this one so I could shed a few lbs. I gained on the other.  45yr old female married 18 years, 4 kids.. nice to know sometimes so you can relate.",Anonymous
22,Bupropion,Panic Disorder,8.0,,"October 16, 2009",83,"Wellbutrin (bupropion):I have severe agoraphobia for 12 or so years. It's very hard to get outside. I have been on Prozac, Celexa, Zoloft, Paxil, Effexor and Buspirone. I have maxed out them all. Each one has stopped working so now I take Wellbutrin 150 twice a day, Buspirone 15mg 3 times and  Effexor 100mg 3 times a day. I was just taking Buspirone and Effexor and I still couldn't get outside. My doctor started me on Wellbutrin so now I take all 3 with no side effects. Took a few days for it to kick in now I can go out in yard to the store, but is still hard. But adding Wellbutrin helped a lot. I would recommend it if it doesn't help you can always go off it and try something else.",yooper602
