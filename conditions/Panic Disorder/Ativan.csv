0,Ativan,Panic Disorder,7.0,Taken for 5 to 10 years,"January 16, 2022",0,"I have very severe anxiety and panic attacks 24/7. it never goes away and I’m too scared to take antidepressants. I also have a phobia of vomiting, fainting, and having a panic attack haha. I also have 24/7 dizziness. I’ve only ever taken 0.5mg of ativan (under tongue) a few times when I was having a panic attack, or when I had to go to the dentist. It made me feel almost more anxious when I left my dentist appointment and I thought I was going to have a panic attack, that was a little over an hour after taking it.The other times I took it, it worked and didn’t peak my panic attack, but made me feel groggy and more anxious when it wore off.For me, any benzo is a hit or miss and I never know if it’s going to work this time or not.",xdoll
1,Ativan,Panic Disorder,9.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"November 27, 2021",0,"I have tried just about every benzo for chronic anxiety, PTSD, insomnia, and panic attacks. Klonopin 0.5mg 3x a day made me depressed and sleepy, and made me want to take extra. Valium 10mg 3x a day worked great but resulted in excess daytime sedation, and far too much muscle relaxation. Xanax was perfect, except for the rebound anxiety, the potency, and the extremely short duration of action. My dr suggested Ativan. I agreed, and switched to 1mg 3x a day, then 0.5mg 3x daily. I found Ativan the least addicting of the benzodiazepines I’ve tried, although it’s supposedly very addictive. I also thought it was relatively easy to come off of, at least compared to klonopin or Xanax! Finally, it has the lowest number of side effects relative to main effect. Ativan doesn’t make me drowsy, but does get rid of my anxiety. And 0.5mg is enough for a bad flare up of anxiety, 1mg enough for a panic attack.",AtivanMan
2,Ativan,Panic Disorder,10.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"November 20, 2021",0,"This drug is amazing. I never foresaw myself taking any psychiatric drugs until I came to a truly terrible time in my life when I really did need them. Panic that would have me in tears from the fear, surroundings and people feeling completely alien. This drug melts away the fear in 20 minutes. It is a godsend in those moments of panic. Don't be scared to try it even if you are wary of psych meds. Be careful though, it can be addictive and that's something you don't want to get into.",LG3
3,Ativan,Panic Disorder,9.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"March 29, 2021",10,Great for stopping my severe panic attacks. I usually only take 1/2 of a tablet (1mg) and dissolve it under my tongue. When a full tablet is required it does make my face feel hot. I also feel slow. Writing this review on a full tablet. Difficult but better than freaking out!,Cordellamt
4,Ativan,Panic Disorder,10.0,,"January 6, 2021",15,"I have severe panic disorder, agoraphobia, IBS-D, and damage to my nervous system due to trauma. I have been given ativan for numerous procedures, which I wasn't sure what it was but I knew for the 24 hours after I felt normal. Not groggy, not post operative blues, nothing just... normal. After over a year of trying a million different things to manage my conditions, I asked my doctor in his office what he puts in my IV because that is magic. He gave me the run down on how ativan can be addicting and how my procedures I get 2 mg and he was going to start me on .5 as needed. In the last month, I've taken a half of a .5 mg tablet as needed and let me tell you, life has been much more bearable. Unfortunately, ativan is suppose to be a short term solution and my problems are very much chronic. I haven't ever experienced more than a slight groggy feeling once. Anyway, if you feel as hopeless as I did, this doesn't hurt to try. I hope it works as well for you as it has for me.",Kayla_Rose
5,Ativan,Panic Disorder,9.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"October 27, 2020",45,"I had tried so many other bad anxiety medications like daily ones and had worse symptoms even panic all day. ATAVIN saved my life , I started with half a pill to see how it affected me and I take .5 . I didn't feel super high or messed up, I felt calm and normal I hadn't ever found something that worked for me EVER. I was so scared to try new anxiety medications bc of bad experiences but this one is amazing as needed. I prefer to take it at night since u get a little tired and relax. Everyone has a different experience and I recommend this as needed. As someone who has anxiety about taking medications you should try it and see if it helps cuz it helped relieve mine anxiety with in  30 mins or less of a panic attack . The next day feels a little mellow in a good way relaxed and  like a human not going a million miles from anxiety. Hope this helps !",Ash
6,Ativan,Panic Disorder,6.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"August 28, 2020",9,I'm consuming this drug on prescription for the last 3 years after switching too many medicine this drug suit me well the only cons is. It effects and calms me from my panic attacks between half and hour to 2 hours some time. I take two pill in rough night and the result next morning is severe headache and very dry throat until I take shower and eat something. Later in day it fades away..,Sibyan
7,Ativan,Panic Disorder,10.0,,"June 24, 2020",22,Medication works great and how it is supposed to. I was on generic lorazepam and would find the quality would differ based on manufacturer and it wouldn’t affect me. After switching to brand the effects are more consistent and it seems so much more potent. It was a fight getting my insurance to completely cover it but it was worth it. 0.5mg and I’m so tired and don’t have any anxiety to worry about. Calms my panic and helps with nausea quite a bit.,Mic
8,Ativan,Panic Disorder,10.0,,"May 10, 2020",81,"I have had panic disorder, agoraphobia, and severe anxiety for 10 years, so I need something like Ativan that sedates me and calms me down when I get hysterical. After numerous trips to the ER and every time I went there they gave me this. Finally talked to my psychiatrist and got the prescription so I don't have to go to a hospital for my severe panic attacks.Medications I used to take made me feel like I was going crazy lol. Unlike other medications I have tried in the past there is really not any side effects besides it makes you a little drowsy. This is a true lifesaver for a person who could not otherwise function. This helps with how debilitating panic attacks and severe anxiety can be. I would highly recommend this and I have tried countless other remedies but this one tops all.",Chris
9,Ativan,Panic Disorder,5.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"January 13, 2020",9,"I've had panic disorder for six years, and when I finally convinced my doctor that there was something wrong with and me and got a prescription I was really hopeful! The first time I used it, it worked relatively well. However, I woke up nauseous and groggy and since nausea is my trigger I decided that I'd only take it if it was ABSOLUTELY necessary. After two months of going without it, I found myself in one of the worst series of panic attacks I've gone through while not at home. My prescribed dosage didn't do anything, I was taking a high dose and it didn't do anything. At that point, I stopped and rode it out for another four hours. When I woke up the next morning, feeling the same groggy and nauseous feeling I'd had last time but worse. Not sure if that residue of the panic or not? The same thing happened a week ago, and again it didn't work, but still left me feeling gross the next day. Maybe it just doesn't work for me?",ravioli
10,Ativan,Panic Disorder,7.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"November 4, 2019",22,I was prescribed Ativan after I was catatonic when I had a psychotic episode. It helped with my anxiety. I had never had any withdrawals and I used it as prescribed.,Jay
11,Ativan,Panic Disorder,10.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"July 28, 2019",48,"I was put on Ativan after I was diagnosed with Pulmonary Embolism.  I was given Ativan while in the ER and during my hospital stay.  After I was released, I was given a prescription of Ativan (with no refills).  It helped me tremendously.  I didn't take it daily, only when I felt a panic attack coming on, or felt my anxiety creeping up also.    My primary physician prescribed me another prescription after I was out of the one from the hospital.  That one had no refills also.  She prescribed it to me because I was a mess from PE and was suffering from depression, anxiety, panic attacks, and she diagnosed me with PTSD.  I was moving also (out of state) and she said that the new doctors I would be seeing wouldn't prescribe me this again, so that is why she prescribed one more 30-count for me.    I only took it when I knew I needed to take it.  I never abused the drug, and it helped me so much it was a life-changer.  I never had any issues with Ativan, no side effects, I love it!",Anonymous
12,Ativan,Panic Disorder,10.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"December 14, 2018",45,I found this medicine extremely helpful. I felt like I was going to die from panic until the doctor prescribed me this lifesaving drug. Worked wonderfully and without any side effects like other drugs I tried.,Senior
13,Ativan,Panic Disorder,2.0,,"July 30, 2018",7,"I was prescribed Ativan sublingual 0.5mg as needed for panic attacks. It did not do anything for me, usually my panic attacks come at night while I'm sleeping. So I tried it and honestly It didn't do anything and on top of that I couldn't sleep after taking it.",SAm
14,Ativan,Panic Disorder,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"July 12, 2018",14,"I have lived with Panic disorder since I was 16 and have had experience with various benzodiazepines. This has got to be the worst drug I have ever taken for a panic attack, it made me feels even more disconnected and stupid. I ended up in the back of an ambulance after taking this drug for a panic attack. I also struggled to sleep after taking this medication and was having suicidal thoughts. So far I would have to say when it comes to elimination of a panic attack, it goes: Xanax > Clonazepam > CBD > Valium > Bromazepam > Ativan.",DsBru

16,Ativan,Panic Disorder,7.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"December 27, 2017",8,"I found most of the benzodiazepines effective against panic disorder. However, Ativan had a very strong amnesia inducing effect that caused me problems. While they all had amnesia effects at various dosages, Ativan really messed with my memory at therapeutic doses of 1-3 mg a day.I frequently found I had done bizarre things on Ativan. I found my car in a neighbors garage, for example, but had woken up in my own house. It’s a bit comical now, but could have been tragic. I had much more stable results with Klonopin.",Anonymous

I have never needed a stronger dose, Now, they are almost banned !Call your representatives and the comment line at the White House and demand we be given this medication because we must have it!",Nink's
18,Ativan,Panic Disorder,10.0,Taken for 5 to 10 years,"May 7, 2017",52,"Ativan 0.5 mg as needed for panic attacks.  Not good for longterm use in my opinion because you will always need more, body will tolerate the dose and need more for same calming effect but its a short-acting med for anxiety and panic attacks and working wonderfully for me for years.  I have bipolar 2 with rapid mood cycling and bad PMS symptoms and its a blessing when I do need it.  I never take more than 1 mg at one time though because it is a strong drug.  Peace.

19,Ativan,Panic Disorder,9.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"April 6, 2017",41,"I began having panic attacks in the middle of the night a few months ago and my doctor prescribed 0.5 mg of Ativan to take as needed. He told me it was fast-acting and would be out of my system in 6 hours. The first time I took it, my panic stopped in about 15 minutes. It was like someone turned the faucet off, just completely gone. I was able to get to sleep without problem for the first time in weeks. I did notice that it becomes considerably less effective if I take it more than 1-2 times in a week, so I try to do everything I can to calm down before reaching for the bottle. Currently starting Zoloft to help with underlying issues (have been on and off it before) and I keep this handy for any random anxiety spikes while my body adjusts.",jtr88

21,Ativan,Panic Disorder,9.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"January 14, 2017",87,"Prior to starting med school, I was having numerous panic attacks. Over time they intensified, getting worse by the day.  I seriously thought that the social life was just done for me. I used to try and stay close to hospitals in case something bad happened to me. I worried excessively about my health (in which I'm completely healthy). I constantly went to emergency rooms to see doctors for having panic aftacks (heart beating fast, shaking, feeling of ""lost in the world"" and scared). I tried so many anti depressants and anti anxiety meds. They either made me too sleepy, headaches, or didn't work at all. ATIVAN has been EXCELLENT! No Side effects ! Works perfect! Psych docs hate the drug! But it works!",StudentDoc

I used to be on a high dose of xanax for several years but my new Dr. Didn't agree with that, so here I am on adivan. I don't feel as if it helps with anxiety that well.

25,Ativan,Panic Disorder,10.0,,"April 9, 2016",75,"I used to get bad panic attacks, and very severe anxiety, and ativan was the best medication I ever took in terms of completely getting rid of my anxiety. It calmed me down quickly, got rid of my anxiety completely, and made me relaxed and calm. It's very potent and effective. Compared to Xanax I think Xanax works better for regular anxiety and Ativan to me seemed stronger. Also Ativan seemed to considerably elevate my mood compared to Xanax. It's probably best for those occasional severe panic attacks not to be taken too often. Very effective though!",RobbyR

27,Ativan,Panic Disorder,10.0,,"December 17, 2015",62,"I use Ativan when I experience a panic attack at the time of going to bed or when I wake up with one.  I only use a quarter of a 2.5 mg. and it seems to calm me down enough to sleep.  I only use it occasionally namely once in about a two week period when something happens in my life which stresses me out and causes the panic attack.  It also calms me down and brings down my BP since I have a over reactive BP spike whenever I have a panic attack.  It's a God sent for me :)  Because of the small dosage, I never have an unwanted side effect...feel refreshed in the morning.",Adczyk

I have every physical symptom of panic. Racing heart, chest pain, dizziness, I've even hyperventilated so bad that I've passed out. This medicine works. My doctor gave me 1mg tablets that are scored.

I have tried so many anti-depressants as well such as cymbalta, cipralex and a couple more.  The best thing is to talk to close friends and family or even a psychiatrist.  talking to people and venting is honestly the best thing you can do for yourself even though it takes a lot of will power to do it.

But Ativan works sometimes I need three pills of .5 mg or sometimes I just need one but I only take them as needed not sure if my doctor is going to continue to give them to me but I definitely need a back up of some kind and it does make you feel better so think goodness for that.,Stella13

Also was a smooth, warm feeling taking it. The downside after a months use, after a week of nothing, the nausea and vomiting kicked in heavy, so I shy away from this one... That time delay of withdrawal was awkward in public places. Still, if I were to ask for an adjuvant, I'd pick Ativan over the more powerful Xanax.",JayneC

Have used it for flight anxiety and flew with a smile on my face.Also used it for general panic disorder. Right when I feel a panic attack coming on I take 0.5mg- very small amount. It kills the panic attack in 15-20 minutes and I feel incredibly relaxed for hours. Only side effect was slight drowsiness but it was not bad at all- even useful if I was trying to go to bed.

41,Ativan,Panic Disorder,10.0,,"December 27, 2011",58,"I have had panic disorder for 19 years. It started with ""status panicus"" (continual panic), which was treated by a year of imipramine. When that was tapered off, I switched to concentrated EPA Omega-3 oil, which has controlled the panic for 18 years. But, it sometimes breaks through, especially when I am building up antibodies to an infection. That is when Tofranil (lorazepam) comes to my rescue. A 0.5 mg dose will quell the aura/breakthrough symptoms. A similar dose at bedtime will get me the crucial night of sound sleep that I need to get the disorder back into its cage.
