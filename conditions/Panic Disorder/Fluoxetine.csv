0,Fluoxetine,Panic Disorder,9.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"November 19, 2021",1,Prozac (fluoxetine):I’ve been on Prozac for about a year now for anxiety/ panic disorder. Switching through 30 mg to 40mg. Currently on 30 mg it’s been working great for me. Only side effects are weight gain but then again I don’t know if it’s from that. I do sometimes have little anxiety here and there but nothing like before which was everyday. I’d recommend it for someone dealing with anxiety etc.,Sar333

2,Fluoxetine,Panic Disorder,2.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"July 28, 2021",2,"Prozac (fluoxetine):Started Prozac for PMDD and Panic disorder. Stopped after two weeks of bad side effects. Usually felt the medication side effects kick in about 1hour after taking it. Felt weighed down, slow breathing, fuzzy headed,  heavy eyes—sedated. It was awful. Triggered three panic attacks on day 13.  Side effects occur randomly throughout the day. Feeling drowsy to the point where I’d need to sink down and close eyes for a minute during conversation. Felt like narcolepsy. Out and then awake in two minutes. Drowsiness, diarrhea, increased anxiety, emotionally detached  during first week.  Pros: I felt good around 5pm and slept fine. Felt good in the morning up until an hour after taking my prescribed dose. Cons: Side effects randomly appearing throughout the day. Severe drowsiness, zoned out, panic attacks, flat moods.",Ree123

The first 4 or 5 days were very emotionally draining, I had heightened anxiety and trouble staying asleep. Along with the common side effects such as headaches, nausea and lack of appetite. But now I feel like my body is getting used to it, the headaches are slowly disappearing, the nausea is subsiding and the heightened anxiety isn’t such a problem anymore and I can successfully say I haven’t had a panic attack since I started taking it.

I was terrified, as In the past I had managed to take SSRI's for no longer than a week due to worsened anxiety and back to back panic from around day 3.This time I took my 20mg capsule of fluoxetine once every 3 days to get used to it slowly. I’ve now been taking it for just over 2 weeks and experience only mild side effects.I’m feeling a lot better calmer, no longer have racing thoughts running around my head and I’m able to slow down and think rationally about a problem without overreacting or getting overwhelmed.

The first two weeks I felt really off and was not a fan at all, but after about a month I was the happiest I have ever been. I am now six months in and feel pretty balanced. I still have my highs and lows, but all together I am so much better than I was before Prozac. My brain fog is gone, I am no longer socially anxious, and never have snappy moods anymore. The cons are the insane dreams, and drinking on it. My dreams feel so real and last all night, but thankfully I don’t wake up many times during the night. Drinking is pretty tough, I definitely cannot handle alcohol like I could before. Also, in the 1st few months I lost 15 lbs (but I was on a really strict diet). I started the diet again a month ago and have not lost 1 pound, which is very frustrating. All together though, prozac has changed my life for the better in many aspects.",Anon

I use to have irrational thoughts and fears of getting sick and would not want to leave my house. I always told my self I don’t need medication, I can handle it myself. My advice, do not fear Prozac! It caused a few side affects the first 2 weeks but over time it became better. It gave me my thoughts back and I can do things without fear now. I started on 20mg and went up to 30mg after a month. My only regret was being scared and waiting over a year to finally do something to help myself. Do not be scared of the reviews, I have been where you were, and it WILL get better.",DG

First and second week was the hardest, upset stomach, heart burn, tiredness, I couldn't stop yawning and I appetite so terrible, lost about 8 pound. After the 2 weeks things started to slowly get better. I eat so much now, never get an upset stomach, sometimes I get heart burn but I noticed if I take the medication with a full glass of water then it helps. I am still tired but not hardly as much now, I feel so much happier and have been able to leave the house, go shopping and take my children to school again. I walk places, I can get into cars, the panic doesn't scare me as much anymore. I would say to stick it out because it does take time but the benefits are amazing.

I was having severe anxiety and panic for months after this attack. I tried various medications with no success. My body was so anxiety ridden I had twitching of my muscles (from head to toe), heart palpitations, feelings of tingly and numbness in hands and feet, and I developed TMJ Disorder from the stress my body was under. Each and everyday was a constant struggle. I had MRI’s, an EMG, blood tests and so many trips to various doctors to rule out other diseases and such. All said the same thing...anxiety and panic. I started Fluoxetine in June 2020. It has changed my life. I noticed it working within the first week and weeks after it just got better. I would say the full effect took 5-6 weeks in.

My doctor told me to expect a bumpy first few weeks, and the reviews I read confirmed this. The first weeks were completely awful. Specifically, the worst I have ever been. My panic sky rocketed and I was unable to leave the house completely (not something I have ever had a problem with before). I was disassociating and started experiencing tremors. My eye would twitch incessantly from the anxious thoughts and my pupils were constantly dilated too.I stayed on it because I was told it would eventually get better, but I should have listened to my instincts sooner. My sleep patterns were non-existent, I had gastrointestinal upset, and I felt like I was living in a haze.I went to the doctor after 3 hellish weeks and it turned out I had mild serotonin syndrome. I am glad this drug has helped so many people, but please consult your doctor if you have concerns.",addie84

Let me first begin by saying this drug takes much longer to work than 4-6 weeks, it could 8-10 weeks for you to feel the therapeutic effect. I am on week 7 and am just now feeling the change I have been so longing to feel my whole life. do not give up, just wait it out. This drug really helped curb my panic disorder to almost non-existent. There are a lot of negative reviews on here pertaining to its efficacy on panic disorder but that is because most people experience severe adverse effects. I myself, did not! It really did help me become a better version of myself, it gave me a chance at a normal life!

I started on 10mg and the first few weeks on it  were fine. I felt very few side effects other then feeling spacey and kind of out of body. The following weeks my anxiety increased to the point where I had to stop going to work  and I started getting dark scary obsessive thoughts that I’ve never experienced In my life. My doctor immediately took me off it cold turkey and the thoughts continued for about a month I felt like I was going crazy and was almost hospitalized. The drug clearly wasn’t for me but that’s not to say it won’t work for someone else. Just be aware and very observant of how you’re feeling while on it especially in the beginning.

Im not afraid to step out of my house anymore and could truly enjoy life. This drug was truly helpful, I can breathe again!

I can't say my experience was all bad because I was going through a rough time and it seemed to make my panic attacks a bit more manageable and less intense but I think for me the cons outweighed the pros. The first time I started it, I stopped eating for nearly 2 weeks which caused me to lose weight, then the dose was upped from 10mg to 20mg and stopped eating for another 2 weeks. The anxiety was pretty bad for the first 2 weeks as well. After the first couple of weeks the side effects calmed down to an extent. I still had pretty bad sexual problems, a lot of heartburn, night sweats, and problems sleeping. So while the side effects weren't major, I tried getting off it due to my anxiety seemingly doing better and the side effects. I was nervous to get off but it seems like I haven't had any odd effects from stopping so that's good. My anxiety is still low so for now I'll stay off.",Ki

At the onset of taking 20 mgs and 40 mgs, my anxiety was 5 fold, unable to sleep well, constant nausea, & lost my appetite. I did use a benzo at times to reduce the anxiety which was high. It is now June 10, 2016, I got my appetite back and sleep pattern was back to normal. Prozac has made a big change in my life. I feel less anxiety and less panicky. Prozac is working pretty well thus far and haven't had to use a benzo in over 14 days.
