0,Paroxetine,Panic Disorder,,Taken for 10 years or more,"February 11, 2022",0,Paxil (paroxetine):So I weaned off Paxil and was completely off it for about two weeks. At about the two week mark my anxiety can back with a vengeance one day. I then realized that I need help and finally admitted to myself I need drugs. I was on 40 December and was off by the beginning of February. From my experience I can tell you after re starting the Paxil again only 10 mg for just two days I can tell the difference already. It just works for me. And I intend to stay on it.,Zeb
1,Paroxetine,Panic Disorder,10.0,Taken for 10 years or more,"October 30, 2021",0,I suffered from agoraphobia for almost 15 years to the extent that I couldn’t even go to my letterbox.

For the first week on it has been a rollercoaster. First 2 days I was doing fine , till Sunday I started to have a feeling of coldness in the back on my head, that went down my whole body, palpitations, dizziness and a headache. I got scared that I even called my mom. Those symptoms follow up the next day. Tuesday I felt like I was choking to a point that had a panic attack, my body felt numb and cold . I was sweating a lot too.. thank god we got home. On Wednesday I felt emotionless and went to the doctor to let her know the side effects. She said they can put me on another medication but I said no. I didn’t wanted to go through another symptoms so I stick with Paxil. Now I woke up to shortness of breath, and again had a panic attack that I felt chest pain, headache and trouble sleeping. And I have the common side effects. Just hope for the best!",Minmin
3,Paroxetine,Panic Disorder,8.0,Taken for 10 years or more,"September 26, 2021",0,I live in Australia and have been on paroxetine for many many years I think about 15 mainly take aropax but there was a shortage so take some generics except for paxtine did not work for me. However paroxetine has helped me a lot over the years. The benefits is I haven’t had a full blown panic attack since I’ve been on it and it mainly keeps any anxiety at bay. The side effects are sometimes dizzy and long time till you can orgasm. I take 20mg a day in the morning with food.,Tamsen
4,Paroxetine,Panic Disorder,7.0,Taken for 10 years or more,"August 25, 2021",0,"Pexeva (paroxetine):I have panic disorder, and have also been diagnosed with Generalized Anxiety Disorder and Major Depression in the past. I tried at least 5 other SSRI's (Zoloft, Prozac, Lexapro), Tricyclics (Imipramine), SNRI's (Wellbutrin, Effexor), and Paxil is the *only one* that has worked for me. It takes me from being completely dysfunctional, paralyzed by panic attacks, into feeling like myself. The downside is the side effects - at 20mg, I gained 10 lbs., felt more tired, and had sexual side effects. At 40mg, I gained an additional 10 lbs., and the tiredness and inability to concentrate became more intense. If a different med works for you, I'd recommend it since Pexeva/Paxil is notorious for its side effects, but when you're feeling hopeless and others just aren't working, give it a go. It's saved my life more than once.",deanima99

7,Paroxetine,Panic Disorder,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"June 9, 2021",1,"Paxil (paroxetine):Unfortunately I was started on this at the highest dose. I have no idea why. The nurse even said I shouldn't be on 40 mg to start, but it was a doctor in a crisis center that I saw for 5 minutes. After I started taking it I had the worst panic attack I have ever experienced and I was hyperventilating and almost passed out. So, I stopped taking it and was scared to take any antidepressants after that, although I have suffer from severe depression and anxiety. So, it wasn't for me. I just started taking Lamotrigine for depression and propranolol for anxiety. It is really helping. So this might be an alternative for anyone that experienced what I did.",egogordo

In fact it was often prescribed for ""premature ejaculation"".The dilemma comes when one attempts to recapture their ""love-life"" by ""reducing"" or ""quitting"" Paxil.Depending on dosage and time on the drug, you MAY INDEED hit a wall of ""withdrawal symptoms"" that ""Ain't No walk-in-the-park""!

Every withdrawal symptoms came to me I felt horrible like it is the end of me seriously (brain zaps , insomnia , nausea, super headache daily, drooping eyelid, blurry eyes).

(Around 4 week mark I noticed the changes).However I had some side effects that made me have to change medications. I became very forgetful and felt ""dumb"" and spaced out at times. Very drowsy in the morning but it helped me sleep a lot (oh how I miss sleeping that well!)  It was such a nice break from so much anxiety and panic but because I work in healthcare I knew it wouldn't be good for me as I need my thinking to he sharp.

I vomited for 4 hours straight and could only stomach fruit for 4 days. All of my muscles were extremely tense and I could barely hold a pen properly, and the restless leg syndrome that came with it was insane. It actually worsened my panic disorder.

I had insane body shivers, felt like a zombie 24/7 whilst on them, I couldn't do the most basic of tasks, I dry heaved non-stop and had persistent air hunger. The withdrawals are terrible and last 3 months or more. If you just have to have an antidepressant , try Celexa or Lexapro instead - they are much milder.I recommend exercise and natural methods/good dieting over ANY anti-depressant.

My doctor also decided I was depressed, and since I had just gotten a divorce I probably was.  A few weeks in I felt pretty good, and was pleased except for gaining 20 lbs in one month.  My doctor tested my thyroid, and there wasn't anything wrong with it, so I was told that weight gain is sometimes a side effect but it would level off.

Worst part, I was only on it for about 2 weeks! Day three of being off of it now and although I feel better somewhat I can still feel that these horrid pills are still in my system.

Ears ringing, sleep issues, brain zaps, sexual dysfunctions, dry mouth, I could go on. But, one day I woke up after taking it for about six months and wouldn’t you know it, no more panic attacks. And these weren’t mild panic attacks, these were almost driving off the road on the way to work in the morning because you can’t breathe, your shaking like a leaf, throwing up, and can’t see straight type attacks. Severe. I’ve been on 60mg a day for around a decade, and I can’t believe how one little pill can completely change your life in the way it has changed mine. This is so so sooooo much safer than benzodiazepines, and it’s nonaddictive. But, if you stop taking it you can rebound quick. Just trust me on that one. So I’m never coming off of it.

I was able to handle the stress of being a mother and a full time college student while working 25 hours a week. I am living proof Paxil works. Without it I am a mess (took myself off for 6 months). I graduated with a 3.92 GPA in Public Health and I know I could have done it without Paxil. It may work different for everyone but I just wanted to share a positive experience. Give it time.

31,Paroxetine,Panic Disorder,8.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"December 13, 2018",18,"I suffered from severe anxiety that led to horrible panic attacks. My physician rapidly started to give me Paroxetine 10 mg for 1 week, then 20 mg the second week. I had some side effects during the first two weeks, but nothing really horrible. Fast forward 6 weeks, anxiety almost totally gone, but couple of panic attacks that were manageable. Again fast forward 6 months, no more panic attacks, no more ridiculous overthinking about past events, and I honestly feel better than my old self.  During this whole period I attended CBT sessions, which help a lot in clearly understanding the functionality of a panic attack and how to cope with it. Very satisfied with this medication so far.

I refused to take Atypical drugs due to possible permanent side effects. Paxil did not eliminate my anxiety and panic but reduced it by 70%. Doctor added Gabapentin 100mg 3 x day and I no longer have any anxiety or panic attacks. Google gabapentin and anxiety. Paired with Paxil I am symptom-free.

I had next to no side effects other than some insomnia and a brief bout of sexual dysfunction where it was hard to climax. I gained about 17 lbs. since starting it, but I also feel better enough to go out to restaurants and I eat out about 4 times a week. My exercise routine has also slackened due to lack of motivation. I suppose it could slow down metabolism, assuming the weight gain isn't entirely my fault (which I think it is), but even so, it's really not a deal-breaker considering how severe my anxiety was.

A low dose of Xanax also helped the first few weeks. I went without anxiety or an attack for 15 years. I weaned off of it for 8 months and anxiety came back.  I’m back on 20mg. It took a couple months for anxiety to subside but it’s working like it’s supposed to again. Because I’m now 40 and having hormonal issues, I might have mild anxiety around my cycle. It’s odd when it happens. I have emergency low dose of Xanax for those times—nothing as severe as before Paxil. It has saved mine and my twin sister’s life.  It’s a great medication for anxiety.

I still had panic attacks here and there and it took me a while to realize I had to improve myself too, not just to rely solely on medication.
