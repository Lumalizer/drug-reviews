0,Effexor XR,Panic Disorder,10.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"March 18, 2022",1,"This medication has been an answered prayer for me. I lived in fear for almost 2 years, couldn’t go anywhere. I would think I was dying all the time, I went countless visits to the ER just for them to tell me it was panic attacks. This medication has turned me to a complete 180. I enjoy life again, I am no longer afraid, I can do the things I love to do again. I feel myself again for the first time in a long time. Effexor has helped set me free. Medicine is not a one size fits all, I definitely went through trial and error with many different meds. SSRI’s have a very negative effect on me so that’s why my doctor suggested an SNRI and that’s exactly what I needed. this is the one for me and the answer to my prayers. So thankful for it and don’t plan on getting off of it.",Life changing
1,Effexor XR,Panic Disorder,10.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"October 1, 2021",31,I have had panic attacks for many years along with agoraphobia. In August the attacks were unbearable and my NP put me on Sertraline. I was so ill and after three weeks said I would  not take it anymore. He then put me on Effexor which I was really uneasy taking because of the side effects I had read about. Well I am here to say it has been a miracle drug for me. I had no side effects starting it and noticed a major improvement the second week. Now I am almost a month in and no panic attacks or anxiety at all! This is major for me. Now I am working on getting out more and driving. Please if  you have major panic then this medication may be for you. Please Please give it a try. I am so very happy I did.,cricket
2,Effexor XR,Panic Disorder,7.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"January 6, 2021",13,Effexor XR saved my life for years! When I was going through a rough time with panic disorder! It took time to work but when it fully kicked in I had my life back. I really had no side effects from this medication that I can remember. But this can really help for you for a while. Only thing that I don't like is you need an increase like once a year and I'm on the max dose and my anxiety came back !!!**But now currently I'm on the max dose 300 mg and it lost it effectiveness so my anxiety is back and it's getting hard again. Not sure what to do. Afraid of change and other meds.,Randomgirl888
3,Effexor XR,Panic Disorder,10.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"December 15, 2020",53,"Effexor XR is the best drug! I have tried Zoloft, Lexapro and Prozac and none of them helped me. I was nervous to start Effexor because of the reviews and side-effects if you miss a pill. I took a leap of faith and started Effexor, and I have been on it for two years now! I have never felt more like myself. Set a reminder if you are nervous you might miss a pill. Every body reacts differently to every drug so please, give Effexor a chance!

I could barely eat or enjoy the simple things in life. I had brain zaps when I first started but they went away completely. I never lost my sexual desires or had any yucky side effects.

5,Effexor XR,Panic Disorder,6.0,,"September 30, 2020",13,"I started Venlafaxine in July 2020 after having a series of terrible panic attacks. I eventually increased the dose to 150mg. The panic attacks were less severe since being on the medication and I only had them after increasing doses. Two reasons I got off of it: sex life diminished horribly and it increased my blood pressure. I was given Metoprolol to help with that and it just made me gain weight, while still having high blood pressure. I was put on Prozac (Fluoxetine) and I’ve got my sex life back and no more high blood pressure. I didn’t have withdrawal symptoms because my doctor had me take Prozac while tapering off Venlafaxine. I only tapered down to 75 mg from 150mg, I had forgotten a dose and just quit taking it altogether (while still on the Prozac). I was only on Venlafaxine a total of 2 1/2 months. The meds do work, every person is different. I just switched meds because of my own personal reasons. I’ll never forget that it made me feel good for the first time in 10 years.",Wetty Bhite

Every person’s body is unique and everybody responds to medicine different ways. However, effexor xr absolutely did not work for me. From day 1, it has caused more problems that it solved. Not only did it not help with my panic/anxiety disorder, but it made me get my period 3 times in 6 weeks and I only know this because every time my dosage was switched, I would get my period again which was also awful because I have PMDD. I’ve tried several medications. Last but not least, I’m currently coming off of it and the withdrawal is awful. I’ve been sick and throwing up for 2 days straight with HORRIBLE panic attacks and headaches. I’m super lethargic and honestly just feel like I have the flu and was told by my primary that it was all from stopping this medicine. Like I said, everybody is going to react different. It was not the drug for me.",HNG

Side effects weren’t too bad taking 75 mg. Drowsiness, increased heart rate, increased tinnitus, nausea, bad night time sweating, increased anxiety at first, head felt a bit spaced out and crazy bad insomnia. Most of these subsided after about 8 days, dosage change amped it up again for about another week. If you can work through it, it’s so worth it! After three weeks basically feeling like myself again.

9,Effexor XR,Panic Disorder,1.0,,"February 2, 2020",14,"I'm going to be honest here it's not pretty. My Dr. prescribed this to me for anxiety after a death in the family. Two hours after taking it I was trying to get from the bathroom (felt like puking and diarrhea at the same time) to the couch crawling on the floor.Needless to say after being asked by a family member (7 yr old daughter) ""should I call an ambulance"" I kept saying no. I just need to get to the couch. Remember I'm crawling. Finally, she said you look so pale are you sure you're ok Mommy? I said yeah just need to get to the couch. My heart was pounding and I was losing consciousness. Daughter called ambulance anyway and the main EMS gentleman said any later I would've suffered a heart attack. I was in a-fib. My BP was dangerously high. Had no previous issues. This drug was almost the end of me! Kudos to those it works for. But not me, never again.",Anna

The 75mg dose was way too much and I ended up in ER. I decided to open the capsule and count the pellets. 1 pellet was about 1mg. I was so desperate to get better (I had tried xanax, lexapro and 1 other SSRI and I had severe reactions to them). I started taking 10 pellets a day and noticed an improvement immediately. I did have a headache in the back of my head at times and also had vivid dreams but it was working. I only needed 10 mgs a day for about a year and weaned off very slowly. Eight years later I developed POTS and my anxiety, brain fog, panic attacks were terrible. Again I got on 10 mgs of effexor and needed to work up to the 37.5 mg pill. I have no panic or anxiety and can drive on the freeways again. It took 2 years to work up to the 37.5 mgs. If you start on a smaller dose these meds should work.",Chamonix

I tried numerous SSRIs before and had terrible side effects with most of them for treating panic disorder. I was very nervous starting Effexor and the only starting side effect I had was feeling like a slight buzz feeling in my head and a little bit of muscle tension in my jaw and shoulders. Those went away in about 10 days. I'm a smaller woman and 75mg worked wonderfully for keep all panic symptoms at bay, the only negative is after about 6 months I started having incredibly vivid dreams due to the medication.

Started zoloft 6 years ago for terrible daily panic attacks. I started on a low dose. Alternated between 25 and 50 MG of zoloft and had some times when I wasn't on it. It always worked until the last time. When I restarted it last year after being off for a year I got really sick with worse panic attacks than ever before. I tried on 25g but couldn't keep anything down. After a while I finally got up the courage to ask for help. My doctor switched me to effexor XR 37.5 MG. The doctor had me stop the zoloft one day and start effexor XR the next. I noticed a difference instantly. No more morning panic, or waking up with my mind racing and night sweats.

Pupils were dilated. Wasn't sure if I was real or where I was or what was happening. Phoned mom and an ambulance and taken to the hospital. After tests done was sent to the wait area and became tired because I had 1 mg of Ativan. After 6 hours went home to sleep. Then the real nightmare begin. Woke up at noon to complete hallucinations. Didn't know what was real and I was actually hallucinating this time. There were colors everywhere. Like a drug trip and been on those before but this was not the same. This was much more intense. Pupils were dilated so much couldn't see the color of my eyes. Sweating profusely and was getting chills over my entire body. Got to bottom of apartment when I collapsed and I could barely see.

42,Effexor XR,Panic Disorder,8.0,,"May 13, 2009",74,I'm 19 years old and have been on Effexor for about 2 years now. The day before my High School graduation I went on it after having a huge panic attack and finally being diagnosed with anxiety (surprisingly I never knew I had it). This has given me my life back. I can't remember when my last panic attack was. I'd recommend it.,Anonymous
43,Effexor XR,Panic Disorder,7.0,,"August 5, 2008",33,"I found Effexor to be a good medication for my symptoms which were anxiety, panic, slight depression. I forced myself to get off of this medication because all it really does is mask the problem. It took me two tries to get off it. I had been taking 75mg for 5 years, eventually moving up to 150mg.",GKBJ
