0,Lorazepam,Panic Disorder,10.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"March 25, 2022",0,I used to be on Xanax. I switched to Ativan because the Xanax made me sleep a lot and I have kids and I can’t do that. My anxiety is very bad I’ve been through a lot. I am on Ativan 1mg now and I take every other night. My fiancé just passed away too and it’s been a help for me to take this pill. But warning do not go without taking it for more than three days because restless leg syndrome will kick in and you will start to feel sick and can’t sleep. I wish I wasn’t dependent on this drug but I need it in order to live and live a normal life.,Thankful
1,Lorazepam,Panic Disorder,7.0,Taken for 5 to 10 years,"January 16, 2022",0,"Ativan (lorazepam):I have very severe anxiety and panic attacks 24/7. it never goes away and I’m too scared to take antidepressants. I also have a phobia of vomiting, fainting, and having a panic attack haha. I also have 24/7 dizziness. I’ve only ever taken 0.5mg of ativan (under tongue) a few times when I was having a panic attack, or when I had to go to the dentist. It made me feel almost more anxious when I left my dentist appointment and I thought I was going to have a panic attack, that was a little over an hour after taking it.The other times I took it, it worked and didn’t peak my panic attack, but made me feel groggy and more anxious when it wore off.For me, any benzo is a hit or miss and I never know if it’s going to work this time or not.",xdoll
2,Lorazepam,Panic Disorder,9.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"November 27, 2021",0,"Ativan (lorazepam):I have tried just about every benzo for chronic anxiety, PTSD, insomnia, and panic attacks. Klonopin 0.5mg 3x a day made me depressed and sleepy, and made me want to take extra. Valium 10mg 3x a day worked great but resulted in excess daytime sedation, and far too much muscle relaxation. Xanax was perfect, except for the rebound anxiety, the potency, and the extremely short duration of action. My dr suggested Ativan. I agreed, and switched to 1mg 3x a day, then 0.5mg 3x daily. I found Ativan the least addicting of the benzodiazepines I’ve tried, although it’s supposedly very addictive. I also thought it was relatively easy to come off of, at least compared to klonopin or Xanax! Finally, it has the lowest number of side effects relative to main effect. Ativan doesn’t make me drowsy, but does get rid of my anxiety. And 0.5mg is enough for a bad flare up of anxiety, 1mg enough for a panic attack.",AtivanMan
3,Lorazepam,Panic Disorder,10.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"November 20, 2021",0,"Ativan (lorazepam):This drug is amazing. I never foresaw myself taking any psychiatric drugs until I came to a truly terrible time in my life when I really did need them. Panic that would have me in tears from the fear, surroundings and people feeling completely alien. This drug melts away the fear in 20 minutes. It is a godsend in those moments of panic. Don't be scared to try it even if you are wary of psych meds. Be careful though, it can be addictive and that's something you don't want to get into.",LG3

5,Lorazepam,Panic Disorder,10.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"May 20, 2021",1,Took for a number of conditions and this worked better than any other medication personally.

6,Lorazepam,Panic Disorder,9.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"March 29, 2021",10,Ativan (lorazepam):Great for stopping my severe panic attacks. I usually only take 1/2 of a tablet (1mg) and dissolve it under my tongue. When a full tablet is required it does make my face feel hot. I also feel slow. Writing this review on a full tablet. Difficult but better than freaking out!,Cordellamt
7,Lorazepam,Panic Disorder,10.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"January 27, 2021",13,"Lorazepam or Ativan if you want to call it that, is a LIFESAVER. I have had panic disorder and lots of anxiety and depression problems along with insomnia. I have been on loads of medication for my conditions. I started out on Prozac which didn't do anything for me after a few months of taking it. All it did was make me nauseous. Then, I tried Zoloft and that was by far the worst. It made me very depressed to the point of attempting suicide. I stopped all SSRIs after that and thought there was no hope. My doctor then prescribed me 2 Benzodiazepines. Xanax for sleep, and Ativan for panic, Those two drugs are lifesavers. Xanax puts me right out and when I wake up I feel refreshed and ready for the day. But Ativan, oh Ativan, that one saves my life. Ativan puts me right out when I am panicking and it works very very quickly. It has stopped me from harming myself during panic attacks. Benzodiazepines are some of the best drugs I have taken in my life and they are so helpful to me.",CJ
8,Lorazepam,Panic Disorder,10.0,,"January 6, 2021",15,"Ativan (lorazepam):I have severe panic disorder, agoraphobia, IBS-D, and damage to my nervous system due to trauma. I have been given ativan for numerous procedures, which I wasn't sure what it was but I knew for the 24 hours after I felt normal. Not groggy, not post operative blues, nothing just... normal. After over a year of trying a million different things to manage my conditions, I asked my doctor in his office what he puts in my IV because that is magic. He gave me the run down on how ativan can be addicting and how my procedures I get 2 mg and he was going to start me on .5 as needed. In the last month, I've taken a half of a .5 mg tablet as needed and let me tell you, life has been much more bearable. Unfortunately, ativan is suppose to be a short term solution and my problems are very much chronic. I haven't ever experienced more than a slight groggy feeling once. Anyway, if you feel as hopeless as I did, this doesn't hurt to try. I hope it works as well for you as it has for me.",Kayla_Rose
9,Lorazepam,Panic Disorder,10.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"December 17, 2020",6,"At the start of 2020 I gave birth to my 3rd child a few weeks later I was diagnosed with PPD and just a month later I went through a traumatic experience in my life,that put me in a really bad state of mind. I tried to fight it for weeks, but it just wasn’t happening for me. I was irritated at everyone and anything, crying 24/7 could barely mother my own children, constantly being overwhelmed with anxiety and anger. That’s when doctors suggested lorazepam it’s absolutely crazy how it works with in 30 minutes and you immediately start to feel yourself again.I’ve had so many episodes  where lorazepam has literally saved me. I’ve currently started on an antidepressant hoping that it will help as a long term strategy, as doctors don’t like to prescribe lorazepam often. So fingers crossed this antidepressant works for me and hopefully I can come off this benzo  for good...... in saying that..... Ativan has been amazing ❤️",Ruby
10,Lorazepam,Panic Disorder,9.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"October 27, 2020",45,"Ativan (lorazepam):I had tried so many other bad anxiety medications like daily ones and had worse symptoms even panic all day. ATAVIN saved my life , I started with half a pill to see how it affected me and I take .5 . I didn't feel super high or messed up, I felt calm and normal I hadn't ever found something that worked for me EVER. I was so scared to try new anxiety medications bc of bad experiences but this one is amazing as needed. I prefer to take it at night since u get a little tired and relax. Everyone has a different experience and I recommend this as needed. As someone who has anxiety about taking medications you should try it and see if it helps cuz it helped relieve mine anxiety with in  30 mins or less of a panic attack . The next day feels a little mellow in a good way relaxed and  like a human not going a million miles from anxiety. Hope this helps !",Ash

I have taken 3, 1mg tablets each day for about 8 years. I have not increased my original dosage and do not find it to be addictive. It makes a world of difference to me. One thing you should definitely be aware of is that different manufacturers are not uniform in manufacturing. Lorazepam varies from manufacturer to manufacturer.

I should’ve listened.I wound up in the ER a week later, and they prescribed me a month’s worth of Ativan, 0.5 mg 3x daily. At first, I swore this was a miracle drug. I felt so much better. No more panic attacks! However, I’ve now been on them for just 5 weeks and started experiencing interdose withdrawals. After 6 or 7 hours I start shaking and panicking. It wakes me from my sleep. I’m now tapering down my dose, and I feel horrible. High anxiety, dizzy, sensitivity to light and sound, and more.

I was on generic lorazepam and would find the quality would differ based on manufacturer and it wouldn’t affect me. After switching to brand the effects are more consistent and it seems so much more potent. It was a fight getting my insurance to completely cover it but it was worth it. 0.5mg and I’m so tired and don’t have any anxiety to worry about. Calms my panic and helps with nausea quite a bit.,Mic

My doctor switched me to lorazepam because it’s more potent but my generic by LEADING PHARM doesn’t work at all!!!!!! I thought not again! Called my CVS and now I’m stuck waiting for approval for Ativan brand name. I took this exact same medication in the ER for panic 1mg and the LEADING PHARMA lorazepam is either sugar or 1/4 strength. Extremely disappointed in the regulation of generics. Putting lactose in pills really? I’m diabetic and lactose intolerant so they won’t work for me.

Finally talked to my psychiatrist and got the prescription so I don't have to go to a hospital for my severe panic attacks.Medications I used to take made me feel like I was going crazy lol. Unlike other medications I have tried in the past there is really not any side effects besides it makes you a little drowsy. This is a true lifesaver for a person who could not otherwise function.

Racing heart, sweating, vomiting, diarrhoea, tingling hands. I become so sick that I can’t move or talk. I feel like I am dying.  They usually arrive abruptly in the middle of the night. I usually end up on the bathroom floor. Since I discovered lorazepam they are the only thing that will stop the attack. I only use them when I am in the throes of an attack which occur every few months. They are a godsend for me!!!  It usually takes two 1mg pills to get the symptoms to subside.

The first time I used it, it worked relatively well. However, I woke up nauseous and groggy and since nausea is my trigger I decided that I'd only take it if it was ABSOLUTELY necessary. After two months of going without it, I found myself in one of the worst series of panic attacks I've gone through while not at home. My prescribed dosage didn't do anything, I was taking a high dose and it didn't do anything. At that point, I stopped and rode it out for another four hours. When I woke up the next morning, feeling the same groggy and nauseous feeling I'd had last time but worse. Not sure if that residue of the panic or not?

When I was first diagnosed with anxiety, over 15 years ago, I was prescribed an antidepressant and Ativan to use if I have a panic attack.

I was taking it regularly for over a year.  I never had withdrawal symptoms and think it’s a disservice to people to scare them away from using it for fear of addiction.

The withdrawals were unbelievably bad some professionals say worse than getting of heroin, Long story short I got off on a withdrawal program Still keep the drug close for the unexpected but I pretty much never use it these days but is just nice to know it’s there if needed. Recent it seemed my world was taken from me when the rug was taken suddenly beneath our feet in our business. I started showing signs of a panic attack which I’m used to by now then I reached into my med pouch and grabbed 2 x 1mg Ativan tabs and they settled me down so now I’m able to think ahead calmly and plan my next move! It’s important to note many medical professionals tell you to put off any important decisions whatever they may be in you life for 72 hours as you brain is still a bit out of sync and this may lead one to making bad decision",Mike

I didn't take it daily, only when I felt a panic attack coming on, or felt my anxiety creeping up also.    My primary physician prescribed me another prescription after I was out of the one from the hospital.  That one had no refills also.  She prescribed it to me because I was a mess from PE and was suffering from depression, anxiety, panic attacks, and she diagnosed me with PTSD.  I was moving also (out of state) and she said that the new doctors I would be seeing wouldn't prescribe me this again, so that is why she prescribed one more 30-count for me.

However I started using lorazepam daily for a month after my son passed away and when I tried to stop I had the worst withdrawal symptoms. Racing heart beat pounding in my chest, nausea, dizzy and felt like I was dying. I was only on 0.5 so tapering wasn't really an option. I checked out and researched some detox places and the success rates aren't good with tapering. I finally found a rapid detox in Phoenix  and it cost me 9 thousand bucks but it beats 30 day inpatient. Beware taking any benzo.

I was being treated for asthma when I was actually having a panic attack. I remember being so frustrated that my medication wasn’t helping my shortness of breath which I thought was asthma. I was properly  diagnosed when I was vacationing in San Diego. I thought I was having an asthma attack. I took my inhaler and got no relief. I thought I was a gonna.

I first try to calm myself down - if that doesn't work I take 0.5 to 1mg of sublingual Lorazepam and the panic attack goes away in a matter of minutes (usually 10 minutes). Also helped me getting sleepy when I would get anxiety attacks before going to bed and couldn't keep calm. It may be habit-inducing, however in some cases it is necessary.

96,Lorazepam,Panic Disorder,10.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"June 2, 2012",94,Ativan (lorazepam):Excellent experience with Ativan. Have used it for flight anxiety and flew with a smile on my face.Also used it for general panic disorder. Right when I feel a panic attack coming on I take 0.5mg- very small amount. It kills the panic attack in 15-20 minutes and I feel incredibly relaxed for hours. Only side effect was slight drowsiness but it was not bad at all- even useful if I was trying to go to bed. Highly recommend.,bhamlaxy
97,Lorazepam,Panic Disorder,10.0,,"December 27, 2011",58,"Ativan (lorazepam):I have had panic disorder for 19 years. It started with ""status panicus"" (continual panic), which was treated by a year of imipramine. When that was tapered off, I switched to concentrated EPA Omega-3 oil, which has controlled the panic for 18 years. But, it sometimes breaks through, especially when I am building up antibodies to an infection. That is when Tofranil (lorazepam) comes to my rescue. A 0.5 mg dose will quell the aura/breakthrough symptoms. A similar dose at bedtime will get me the crucial night of sound sleep that I need to get the disorder back into its cage. Sometimes one good night is all I need to get back on track - a life saver.",cloudokumo
98,Lorazepam,Panic Disorder,9.0,,"June 6, 2011",71,"Ativan (lorazepam):Potent medication.  What makes this medicine so useful for panic/bad anxiety is that you can dissolve it under your tongue in case you need to get the anti-anxiety/panic effect quickly.  It tastes ""sugary"".  A tip my doctor told me about. Same for Klonopin. Very effective medicine.",Anonymous
99,Lorazepam,Panic Disorder,10.0,,"December 14, 2010",51,"Ativan (lorazepam):I been having these episodes of panic since 19; after a breakup with my baby's father, I woke up 1 day couldn't breath and went to hospital. Thought I was dying or having a heart attack. They didn't know what was wrong with me after all kinds of test I've was going back and forth 5 x a day finally they figured I had Anxiety disorder/panic attacks! I have taken Bio-feedback, relaxation techniques, therapy and medications until I found out that Ativan 3 x 1mg/day or I will be a regular in the E.R. Xanax works but not as long or as Well.",Lushuz

101,Lorazepam,Panic Disorder,10.0,,"June 26, 2010",52,"Ativan (lorazepam):I took this medication because I was having panic attacks. I had no drowsiness, and no side effects. This medication didn't make me apathetic or sedated; it simply took the panic away so I could think and get my work done. It saved me. After the panic attacks stopped, I was still suffering from anxiety (a new condition for me), and the Ativan didn't help that, so my doctor switched me to Klonopin, which worked great for day-long anxiety, while I also tapered up on Zoloft. Still waiting to figure out if the Zoloft works.",Celebrian
