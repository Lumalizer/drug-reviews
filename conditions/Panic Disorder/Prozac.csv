0,Prozac,Panic Disorder,9.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"November 19, 2021",1,I’ve been on Prozac for about a year now for anxiety/ panic disorder. Switching through 30 mg to 40mg. Currently on 30 mg it’s been working great for me. Only side effects are weight gain but then again I don’t know if it’s from that. I do sometimes have little anxiety here and there but nothing like before which was everyday. I’d recommend it for someone dealing with anxiety etc.,Sar333

2,Prozac,Panic Disorder,2.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"July 28, 2021",2,"Started Prozac for PMDD and Panic disorder. Stopped after two weeks of bad side effects. Usually felt the medication side effects kick in about 1hour after taking it. Felt weighed down, slow breathing, fuzzy headed,  heavy eyes—sedated. It was awful. Triggered three panic attacks on day 13.  Side effects occur randomly throughout the day. Feeling drowsy to the point where I’d need to sink down and close eyes for a minute during conversation. Felt like narcolepsy. Out and then awake in two minutes. Drowsiness, diarrhea, increased anxiety, emotionally detached  during first week.  Pros: I felt good around 5pm and slept fine. Felt good in the morning up until an hour after taking my prescribed dose. Cons: Side effects randomly appearing throughout the day. Severe drowsiness, zoned out, panic attacks, flat moods.",Ree123
3,Prozac,Panic Disorder,9.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"May 3, 2021",11,"I am currently on my second week of Prozac/Fluoxetine and honestly I can already start seeing the changes. The first 4 or 5 days were very emotionally draining, I had heightened anxiety and trouble staying asleep. Along with the common side effects such as headaches, nausea and lack of appetite. But now I feel like my body is getting used to it, the headaches are slowly disappearing, the nausea is subsiding and the heightened anxiety isn’t such a problem anymore and I can successfully say I haven’t had a panic attack since I started taking it. It’s hard in the beginning to stick to, trust me I thought of quitting many times! But it’s worth powering through!",Kitten
4,Prozac,Panic Disorder,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"March 3, 2021",6,"My MD put me on Prozac for OCD thoughts & anxiety/panic disorder (I have OCD related to medical illness & every pain in my body may be cancer which lead to severe anxiety/panic).  He started me on 20mg 2 days in & I was waking up in the middle of the night sweating, racing heart, have to take a xanax to just relax, then I started with jitters/tremors which did not help my anxiety related to medical issues (google search tremors took me to all sorts of illnesses which fuelled my anxiety).  I had a full blown panic attack AT work by day 5  People say to ride this out, there is NO way I can do this for another 2-4 weeks.  Felt like it was the end of me yesterday & briefly thought it would be better if I did because I can't live like this.  Last night I was up at 2AM again racing thoughts/heart, sweating, shaking, had to take 0.25 mg xanax to go back to bedDid not take my Prozac today I haven't have panicky thoughts just feeling some jitteriness.",A
5,Prozac,Panic Disorder,,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"February 25, 2021",22,"So happy on Prozac. I was on Effexor 150mg for a few months until I had had enough of the sexual dysfunction and the awful other side effects it was giving me. Taking Prozac has not only helped with my panic disorder, but also it causes no sexual side effects for me. I’ve been taking 40mg since September 2020, it is now February 2021. I’m happier than ever!",JingleBells
6,Prozac,Panic Disorder,4.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"January 25, 2021",6,"I have taken Prozac on a short term basis for anxiety and depression a handful of times.  It had a minimal effect on lessening my anxiety and seemed to increase depression.  I recently took it for 5 weeks and while I wasn’t experiencing full blown panic attacks, I still felt edgy and it was blunting my emotions to the point I felt numb or like a zombie.   I also experienced diarrhea and upset stomach.   My doctor switched me to Lexapro and I’m so glad I stuck it out and tried a different SSRI as it has been a life changer for me.",Molly
7,Prozac,Panic Disorder,8.0,,"October 19, 2020",30,"After having anxiety and depression for about 3 years and doing nothing about it, I finally saw a psychiatrist and was prescribed 20 mg of prozac. The first two weeks I felt really off and was not a fan at all, but after about a month I was the happiest I have ever been. I am now six months in and feel pretty balanced. I still have my highs and lows, but all together I am so much better than I was before Prozac. My brain fog is gone, I am no longer socially anxious, and never have snappy moods anymore. The cons are the insane dreams, and drinking on it. My dreams feel so real and last all night, but thankfully I don’t wake up many times during the night. Drinking is pretty tough, I definitely cannot handle alcohol like I could before. Also, in the 1st few months I lost 15 lbs (but I was on a really strict diet). I started the diet again a month ago and have not lost 1 pound, which is very frustrating. All together though, prozac has changed my life for the better in many aspects.",Anon
8,Prozac,Panic Disorder,9.0,,"October 10, 2020",143,"Hello! I have now been on prozac for 7 months now and I can honestly say this medication has helped me so much! I use to have irrational thoughts and fears of getting sick and would not want to leave my house. I always told my self I don’t need medication, I can handle it myself. My advice, do not fear Prozac! It caused a few side affects the first 2 weeks but over time it became better. It gave me my thoughts back and I can do things without fear now. I started on 20mg and went up to 30mg after a month. My only regret was being scared and waiting over a year to finally do something to help myself. Do not be scared of the reviews, I have been where you were, and it WILL get better.",DG

I am going on week 4 of 20mg and I am finally starting to feel better and more like myself. The first week was REALLY hard. For 2 days I had massive anxiety, worse than ever before to the point where I felt like I couldn’t breathe. I almost stopped this medication, but I pushed through because that’s what everyone said.

13,Prozac,Panic Disorder,1.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"February 6, 2020",17,Was prescribed Prozac for panic attacks and I stuck it out for 2 months. I started on 10mg and the first few weeks on it  were fine. I felt very few side effects other then feeling spacey and kind of out of body. The following weeks my anxiety increased to the point where I had to stop going to work  and I started getting dark scary obsessive thoughts that I’ve never experienced In my life. My doctor immediately took me off it cold turkey and the thoughts continued for about a month I felt like I was going crazy and was almost hospitalized. The drug clearly wasn’t for me but that’s not to say it won’t work for someone else. Just be aware and very observant of how you’re feeling while on it especially in the beginning. I should have stopped the medication earlier but wanted to stick it out considering that I was told it takes time to build up in your system. Just be cautious,Anonymous
14,Prozac,Panic Disorder,1.0,,"December 11, 2019",35,"I started taking Prozac 9 days ago. I have my first ever panic attack 2 days ago in which I thought I was wasn't going to live.Since the panic attack I haven’t been able to sleep, eat or drink. I haven't stopped thinking about dying once. So for these 2 days I have been throwing up, nervous feeling in my tummy, dizziness, feeling scared and panic and it hasn’t stopped. It’s been here constantly. I’ve spoke to my doctor and my counsellors and they said to ride it out. But I’m not going to do that.I had a suicidal thought last night which has never happened for me. I’ve had to move in with my mum for the next couple of days so I’m not alone because I’m that scared of dying. I hope that after the tablets leave my system I’m back to my old ways. I just don’t know what to do or say to anyone anymore. Doctors have even had to give me diazepams so I can stay calm and half the time they only work for around 15-20 minutes, all of this is torture.PLEASE DO NOT TAKE THIS.",Amber
15,Prozac,Panic Disorder,7.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"November 5, 2019",14,"I took prozac in my 30's for what was thought to be panic disorder. Years later I was diagnosed with Aspergers and weaned off the prozac. Now 10 years after that I am in perimenopause and my GP prescribed the prozac again to help with mood swings, IBS, and insomnia. And it does, but for the last couple of periods and only during the period week, I have had several panic attacks every night, even when ""Aunt Flow"" did not show up. They are worse than when I was younger. I have been to the ER by ambulance several times with heart attack like symptoms.  The panic attacks wake me up every couple of hours and on my Sleep Cycle app it looks like it happens on the upswing of the rem cycle. But one day I did not drink coffee, that night I did still woke up a couple of times with racing heartbeat but it subsided quickly with deep breathing, and there were no other symptoms. If quitting coffee doesn't help then I will have to get back with my psychiatrist on what to try next.",Michelle

17,Prozac,Panic Disorder,10.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"October 12, 2019",54,I started 20mg daily. The only side effect I experienced was delayed orgasm and this was within first week.  This medication takes time to begin working.  People who concentrate on their physical symptoms too much often throw in the towel before this medication has had time to start working.  Don't do that. Give it time. Prozac makes me feel normal again.  I don't feel like I'm going to panic over everything I feel in my body anymore.  I'm sleeping much better and my crazy mood swings have disappeared.,Ivyrose
18,Prozac,Panic Disorder,3.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"September 11, 2019",13,"I struggle with severe anxiety and panic attacks, as well as depression. I was on Zoloft (sertraline) for about two years and found myself feeling pretty good so I decided to stop taking it. After starting university however, I found that my anxiety was getting to an unbearable state and so I went to my doctor and she prescribed me Prozac. At first I had very, very adverse side effects. I had tremors and super bad anxiety. After a while, I noticed less frequency in my panic attacks but unfortunately my mood was absolutely brutal. I was constantly depressed, couldn’t sleep, couldn’t eat, thought really dark thoughts very often, feel agitated and irritated constantly. I literally felt like I wanted to die, like I literally had no choice because the pain was so unbearable.I am now off the medication and I feel as though a bag of bricks have been lifted from my shoulders. I wouldn’t recommend this medication if you are prone to depressive thoughts or if you are young like me (I’m 19).",Kate

It also made me really jittery so within a week I stopped taking it. I'm currently still going through the side effects since I only stopped taking it 3 days ago. Hopefully this anxiety goes back to being tolerable like it was before I got the meds.,Koty

After 5 days off and I’m still in the highest anxiety crisis I’ve ever been in. I was prescribed it for panic attacks but the panic attacks before were nothing as bad as when I started taking the Prozac, I ended up with depersonalization mixed with severe panic attacks and insomnia. It gave me problems I never had before, my doctor had to put me on diazepam just to counteract the side effects!

23,Prozac,Panic Disorder,10.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"May 24, 2019",115,"I have always suffered with generalized anxiety until recently due to stress from nursing school, it spiralled into full on panic attacks that became daily and debilitating. I started taking prozac which completely changed my life. I had very mild side effects, lucky for me I didn't get the side effects that many have stated on this forum just some mild insomnia but it completely eradicated my panic attacks and brought a whole new outlook on my life. Im not afraid to step out of my house anymore and could truly enjoy life. This drug was truly helpful, I can breathe again! It took about 2-3 weeks for the effects to kick in and again don't be afraid of the side effects in the beginning, they will go away!

24,Prozac,Panic Disorder,5.0,,"May 20, 2019",10,"I started taking Prozac mostly for my panic attacks but a little bit for my anxiety and depression as well. I can't say my experience was all bad because I was going through a rough time and it seemed to make my panic attacks a bit more manageable and less intense but I think for me the cons outweighed the pros. The first time I started it, I stopped eating for nearly 2 weeks which caused me to lose weight, then the dose was upped from 10mg to 20mg and stopped eating for another 2 weeks. The anxiety was pretty bad for the first 2 weeks as well. After the first couple of weeks the side effects calmed down to an extent. I still had pretty bad sexual problems, a lot of heartburn, night sweats, and problems sleeping. So while the side effects weren't major, I tried getting off it due to my anxiety seemingly doing better and the side effects. I was nervous to get off but it seems like I haven't had any odd effects from stopping so that's good. My anxiety is still low so for now I'll stay off.",Ki

I went from having up five or six panic attacks a day to having only one very minor one this week. I have also experienced probably 90% less derealization and disassociation episodes in the last three weeks. My hypochondria is 100% VANISHED!!! I was so scared of the side effects I obsessively read reviews on this site and many others but I had none except a minor loss of appetite the first week. I noticed a change in energy by the end of my first week. Its not that I have euphoria or experience no moments of anxiety but they pass faster, I don't immediately catastrophize and I am beginning to believe that even if bad things to happen to me I am strong enough to get through them. I used to cry multiple times everyday and I haven't cried once this week. I really hope it continues to work for me!",Lemons

30,Prozac,Panic Disorder,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"November 29, 2018",26,I started to get terrible panic attacks at night about 5 months ago. It was very scary and heartbreaking. I am a mother or 3 boys and I was losing my mind. I am on a low dose of ativan but it wasn't keeping the panic away and I started to have episodes during day. I can handle my anxiety and depression but I cannot handle panic attacks. Worst thing ever. So I decided to try Prozac. 10 mg was making me sick and was too strong. I felt funny. So now I cut it in half and put the powder in a full glass of water every morning. So I am in 5 mgs daily and ativan when needed. I haven't had a panic attack since. If the blue pill gives you heartburn.......try cutting it open and putting the medicine in water. When I started doing that my heartburn went away. I feel so much better and I don't feel drugged up or strange. I still have issues but I don't panic from the stress any more.,Blizzy

34,Prozac,Panic Disorder,9.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"February 4, 2018",37,"30 year old guy (active, good job, college educated). I’m here to tell you this medicine worked for me — FOR SURE. I take just 10MG at night. I also take TIME RELEASE Xanax every evening before bed (0.5MG). The combo of the two has reduced my anxiety, panic, racing thoughts by 85%-90%. One year ago I was in the same place as you likely are. Looking for any solution and upset thinking nothing could help my, almost nightly,  panic attacks. Everyone is different with this sorta stuff. However GIVE THIS A TRY, if you are on the fence. You owe it to yourself. And don’t worry, with your doctors permission you can probably still enjoy a few drinks here and there. Personally, I still enjoy a few cups of coffee each day (probably shouldn’t) and I also enjoy a glass or two of wine a few nights weekly. Take your doctor’s advice.",FloridaGuy25

First week was horrible, almost all my symptoms increased couldn't eat lost my sex drive. It's now a week in and I can't even tell you how much better I feel.

My psychiatrist prescribed me the pills. They did not work for me. I have not been taking the pills since April 17th. So its been 3 days and I feel better and beginning to be back to my normal ways and more alert and less depressed. I have read online that people who stopped taking it feels good at first then it starts to kick in like emotions and stuff trying to get it out of ur system. I guess withdrawal? But I couldn't do prozac anymore. Made me VERY depressed and annoyed all the time. Didn't work for me",Tiamani

I started at Prozac 20 mgs and felt good but it suddenly stopped working after 10 days. 10 days later, I bumped it up to 40 mgs.  At the onset of taking 20 mgs and 40 mgs, my anxiety was 5 fold, unable to sleep well, constant nausea, & lost my appetite. I did use a benzo at times to reduce the anxiety which was high. It is now June 10, 2016, I got my appetite back and sleep pattern was back to normal. Prozac has made a big change in my life. I feel less anxiety and less panicky. Prozac is working pretty well thus far and haven't had to use a benzo in over 14 days. You must give Prozac at least 6 or 8 weeks and you'll know by that time if it is for you or not.",Anonymous

My anxiety and panic disorder can be frightening, plus the depression aspects can make for a scared and crying disaster. The negatives I've had on this was when I first started I could not eat. But that side effect did go away after a few weeks. The other side effect is not being able to fall asleep without some sort of drug to slow my brain down. I've been on a combination of mood drugs.

Then I was finally stated on Prozac(fluoxetine). I had zero side effects during the first week--which was vastly different from my experience with the other two--and at 40mg/day fluoxetine seems just as efficacious. Fluoxetine has worked well for my panic, depression, and general anxiety. One must give it time to work.
