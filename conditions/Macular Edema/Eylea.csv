0,Eylea,Macular Edema,8,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"November 13, 2021",1,"After 2 eye strokes my normal vision was fine but I had difficulty reading from my left eye. After one injection my eyesight though that eye improved and after the second it was probably about 60% as good as my right eye. Subsequently, my sight stabilized and I am now on an 8 week check to see if any deterioration has taken place. During normal sight I get a little sensitivity/light balance problems but can read and drive normally. I only use reading glasses. I am in the UK where this treatment is covered by the NHS.",Henry Root
1,Eylea,Macular Edema,1,,"April 30, 2021",0,Have swelling edema following  cataract  surgery  which left  with a grey cloud and heaps of black  floaters in my vision .Tried acular eye drops for a month  to help clear my vision  unfortunately  it didn't help so  my doctor gave me  eylea injection into my left eye  and now  I have a shimmer in  my eye  all the time since the needle a month ago .When it gets dark  the shimmer  turns into flickering sparkling  lights and even with my eye closed I can still see then  It's very stressful  and hard to sleep.  Any ideas how to fix this problem  would be appreciated.,Flurry

3,Eylea,Macular Edema,8,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"December 30, 2019",9,"I've had 3 injections with Eylea and my eyesight has improved slightly. The injections are once per month. I was previously on Lucentis or something like that and it was keeping it level, not improving. My 4th will be in a few weeks.  My doc is fantastic and I'm only out of pocket $25- after medicare rebate;.",NearlyBlind
4,Eylea,Macular Edema,1,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"May 27, 2019",31,I had 12 injections  Eylea over a period of 18 months. I stopped the injections after learning medication was like a chemo and dangerous side effects. Now eight months later my vision is like it was before the injections. I would not go through that experience again. Painful and very expensive. I have experienced several of the side effects mentioned on website.,wisegal
