0,Niacin,Hyperlipoproteinemia Type IV Elevated VLDL,8,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"June 27, 2012",23,"Niaspan (niacin):I have been taking Niaspan ER 2000mg for three months.  I am scheduled to get my first lab tests to determine its effectiveness on lowering my elevated Lpa level and whether my liver function is okay.  I have noticed that the medicine needs to be taken by 930 or 1000pm.  If I take the medication too late in the evening, I still can feel the effects of Niaspan when I get up for work the next morning.  I also noticed that taking it with water alone, causes the symptoms to be much worse than taking it with a small glass of milk or snack.  So I take it before 10pm with a small glass of milk or snack, and there seems to be very little symptoms.",Anonymous
