0,Botox,Chronic Spasticity,1,Taken for less than 1 month,"December 8, 2019",1,Had  ANISMUS  (the failure of normal relaxation of pelvic floor muscles during attempting to poop) for years unable to VOLUNTARILY POOP BUT I worked out a regime that worked for me but it was very time consuming so I could only work part time. After PRESSURE financially and sick and tired of this and a consultant recommending BOTOX I went ahead. WORST thing I've ever done. I wasn't told any side effects exact opposite was told it was easy! It would wear off in couple of months. One year 7 months later I'm housebound lost my job and having to get benefits and am in excruciating pain. I've every side effect under he SUN and nobody wants to know. This was done through the NHS and it's RUINED MY LIFE. Don't get this done... If it goes BADLY WRONG which it has its far worse than what you originally had to deal with and all I've been told is they don't know I might get better and that I'm the same as I was.....! Think twice.. Had I seen this site and known the risks I wouldn't have gone ahead.,Skip
1,Botox,Chronic Spasticity,3,,"October 18, 2018",2,"My Daughter is 32 non verbal and has had botox injections for about a year in her hamstrings calves and they targeted multiple muscles. Suddenly now she has about 5-6 falls a day she just falls backwards or collapses and falls forward without the ability to catch herself. The dr. says the botox wore off so he targeted more muscles. She cannot talk or express if she has headaches or muscle pain or spasms from her botox injections for her spasticity. It has not improved her gait or walking. I have read so many reviews of pain after. Yet my daughter cannot explain or express what happens before or after her falls or her daily activities if she is dizzy or disoriented.  I am disappointed because the first few she walked better, now its getting worse.",Angelman
2,Botox,Chronic Spasticity,8,,"February 11, 2017",2,"My daughter was forced have a baclofen pump at the age of 2 and 2 months after brain injury before anything else was tried. They set pump at 497mcg sent her home on clonazepam, diazepam, trazdone and nurotin  She is so tight I couldn't get her hands to open without force. I changed doctors as they reduced the meds she loosened up more and more is able to move and use a gait trainer. Introduced botox was introduced first time 7mo ago only gave 1 injection each hamstring and 1 in each abudctor to see how she would respond. I was amazed I can't wait to see next treatment. I totally recommend boxtox",JackO27
3,Botox,Chronic Spasticity,3,Taken for less than 1 month,"April 12, 2013",13,"Usually works for severe spasms in my upper back, neck, ect. This time was horrible. ended up in hospital 6 days later with uncontrollable trap pain, despite having someone massage for hours.  No relief. My arms also went weak, could not even lift a cup. Ironically, usually pain in muscles all goes away and sometimes I have a weak Left arm, but I deal with it. This time, pain increased all over back and neck, ribs, arms, I could not lift anything or do anything. Hospital 5 days to try and relieve pain.  Follow up with dr. in 4 more days. I will not get it again, as it did nothing for pain relief and caused both arms to not raise and have no strength and caused more pain because of it.",karmagirl216
