0,Baclofen,Chronic Spasticity,10,Taken for 5 to 10 years,"January 27, 2021",9,"I was diagnosed with a connective tissue disorder that causes my muscles to have spasticity issues. I was prescribed Gabapentin which didn't work and had horrible side effects, so they tried Baclofen 10mg and I found myself feeling better.  I take 10mg 3x/day and have been for 6 years now.  There are zero side effects and on days I forget to take it I can definitely tell a major difference in my muscle pain levels and spasticity.  Baclofen truly saved me. It also helps counteract any muscle pain I get from the modafinil I take. I feel human again, I'm in less pain.",Emah
1,Baclofen,Chronic Spasticity,4,,"January 9, 2021",3,"Helps with being able to walk but does NOT help with the spasms.I take 20mgs 4xâ€™s a day.MS Sucks!",DG
2,Baclofen,Chronic Spasticity,3,Taken for 10 years or more,"September 30, 2020",3,"baclofen has dangerous side effects, including bradycardia.  I took 20mg twice a day for 12 years and had to stop. My pulse had gone below 60 beats per minute and so could not get a valid blood pressure reading.  I also had severe vertigo.  Now I am two weeks without it and I am OK.  I was also taking norvasc 2.5 mg with it.",PETE
3,Baclofen,Chronic Spasticity,2,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"March 24, 2020",12,"I have chronic spasticity in my back, neck and shoulder due to unexplained demyelenation in my spinal cord. I was prescribed baclofen, with increasing doses up to 60mg/day (3x 20mg). It was completely useless.  I felt nothing. Zero relief, but also zero side effects.  It was as though I wasn't taking anything at all.  I'm glad others get relief from this drug, but I got nothing at all.",dfa
4,Baclofen,Chronic Spasticity,1,,"November 24, 2016",17,Lioresal (baclofen):Taken for chronic neck pain. Not only did it not help my neck pain but also triggered a migraine and made me very nauseous. It also caused drowsiness and chills.,Namaste927
5,Baclofen,Chronic Spasticity,9,Taken for less than 1 month,"December 27, 2014",37,It works better than Flexeril. I have a spinal cord injury.,Ter34
6,Baclofen,Chronic Spasticity,5,,"December 24, 2014",32,"I take baclofen (20mg 3Xs a day) for muscle twitching, spasms, and spactisity.  It has helped some (for instance I can still feel the muscle twitching but its no longer visible twitching).  Hasn't seemed to help with the spasticity though.  As for side effects at first I had a lot of drowsiness and dizziness.  Now I am horribly depressed and think its from the baclofen so I may discontinue soon.",Jules A
7,Baclofen,Chronic Spasticity,9,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"September 21, 2014",83,I have spasticity (stiffness) in my lower back and right leg due to multiple sclerosis.  I had used marijuana for quite a while and it helped my spasticity but was not good for my cognitive thinking.  I stopped the marijuana and began taking baclofen 20 mg x 3 /day.  I walk and feel so much better.  I might not be as aware of how much better I am until I miss or delay taking it. I have experienced no side effects.,oddsr
8,Baclofen,Chronic Spasticity,8,,"April 4, 2014",49,I just started taking Baclofen in March of 2014 with almost immediate relief. I had a mini stroke back in 2007 and have been dealing with spasticity in my right leg ever since. I was at the point where my leg was so tight it was hard to walk. Anyway after two days of taking Baclofen 10mg twice per day I feel like a new man. My muscles in my right leg have just completely relaxed after taking Baclofen and it's just an amazing feeling after seven years of tightness in my leg and the last two being just agonizing.,B.B.H.
9,Baclofen,Chronic Spasticity,9,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"September 14, 2013",61,"I have been taking the medicine since November 2012.  I started at 10mg a day, then 20mg daily, and now at 30mg daily in 3 divided doses.  I am on this medicine due to a spinal cord stroke I suffered in July 2012 that left me unable to walk. It was an incomplete stroke though so as time has gone by I have been able to use my walker in place of the wheelchair.  Over the past couple of days I have found myself being able to walk seven to ten steps on my own. I attribute this to the baclofen working on the spasticity in my right leg.  Side effects were some drowsiness at the beginning, but I am also on tramadol, oxycodone, Lyrica, and morphine, so it may be that some effects were simply masked by these other medications.  I give baclofen an A !",cutter17
10,Baclofen,Chronic Spasticity,6,Taken for less than 1 month,"July 30, 2013",26,Couldn't figure out the dosage....made me so sleepy at work so only took it at night but it didn't matter.  It did help the cramping in my legs (have Multiple Sclerosis) but I gave up on Baclofen but now I have to wait for 4 more months to talk to my neurologist to see if I can try something else.,Anonymous
11,Baclofen,Chronic Spasticity,8,,"May 25, 2013",23,I get a sick feeling but the relief from spasticity seems worth it most of the time,Pattiellenbt
12,Baclofen,Chronic Spasticity,9,,"December 29, 2012",35,Gablofen (baclofen):I find it does a good job. I have been on it (on & off) since 2004 for multiple sclerosis.,brneyedgrl3742
13,Baclofen,Chronic Spasticity,8,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"October 27, 2012",72,"Gablofen (baclofen):I have severe spasticity and this medicine really helps my muscles to relax.  I only take 20 mg a day however if I do need to take an additional pill for the ""bad days"" I don't suffer any additional side effects...only a bit more sleepier by the end of the day.",Anonymous

16,Baclofen,Chronic Spasticity,10,,"May 8, 2009",35,This drug works. If I am late with a dose or miss a dose I feel it. I can't go through the day without it.,TRUSTINGOD
17,Baclofen,Chronic Spasticity,6,,"December 1, 2008",42,"Lioresal Intrathecal (baclofen):I have had a BIT for 2 years now, and although I can't tell a difference sometimes, I would hate to turn it off.  It is much better than oral baclofen, because of the side effects.  I was on 60mg/day oral and I couldn't take any more because of fatique.  I am currently on 512mcg/day and feel no side effects.",Anonymous
