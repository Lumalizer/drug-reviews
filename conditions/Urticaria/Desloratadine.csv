0,Desloratadine,Urticaria,1,,"November 8, 2019",4,"Aerius (desloratadine):I am 64 years old and suddenly  developed a severe itch on my hands back legs etc.  The itching was intolerable.  I went to my local clinic and was prescribed Aerius tablets 5mg x 1 per day, with Aristocort 3 x a day.   Neither medications relieved my condition one bit.  My hands are so swollen and red and now the rash has spread to my feet. The GP said at the time both medications will give me relief in a few hours.  They didn't, and now it's 10 hrs later.   I am so sore, itchy and swollen and it's 10pm so I'm going to the hospital.",Anders
1,Desloratadine,Urticaria,1,Taken for less than 1 month,"June 11, 2019",2,This drug (desloratadine) was absolutely useless. I was taken fexofenadine which the doctor told me was the strongest  antihistamine and that didn't work then she give me these which has a less strength  but for me to take 2 a day in the 1st week then go back to normal dose. I'm only in the 1st week and my rash is worse than when I was taking the fexofenadine I am totally fed up  this itching is driving me nuts and I have an holiday coming up . I'm getting really worried now I'm not going to get this under control,Welshy

Eventually down from 24 hour to 6 or 8 hours before I changed medication.Reduced or eliminated itching and burning but not appearance so much.,Yarbdor
3,Desloratadine,Urticaria,8,Taken for less than 1 month,"May 9, 2017",0,"It doesn't work 100% but makes the itching livable and functional. I live in France and 30 tablets cost $5, so I suggest leaving the country if you need meds",Anonymous
