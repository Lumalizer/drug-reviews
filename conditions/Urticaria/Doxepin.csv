0,Doxepin,Urticaria,9.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"December 9, 2020",16,"Waking up every day with chronic hives all over my body (no known cause) for months that wont go away with benedryl, singular, allegra, and even xolair, my new allergist suggested doxepin. At this point, I was willing to try anything that could make them stop. When I tell you I haven't had a hive on my body since starting doxepin, its no joke. Doxepin has been a life saver and has helped tremendously with my chronic hives.",May
1,Doxepin,Urticaria,5.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"March 24, 2020",3,"On doxepin 35mg dose, use it for chronic urticaria + insomnia. Been given doxepin as an interim drug for the urticaria because famotidine unavailable. Urticaria - hives still not fully under control but I can’t blame the doxepin as I’m on other meds for it as well. There hasn’t been a massive increase of hives since transitioning from famotidine to doxepin so it must be doing something. Had to stop the endep I was originally taking for insomnia as they can’t be taken together.Insomnia > worked great for the first few weeks but then did nothing. The day time drowsiness when you first take it only lasted a few days for me. Unfortunately, I’m back to being an insomniac so I’m hoping I can get back on the endep soon!",Ehlers

3,Doxepin,Urticaria,1.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"October 6, 2019",4,"This medication does absolutely nothing. This is a refill and apparently the pharmacy switched to this manufacturer. My original prescription was from AMNEAL Pharmaceuticals and after 2 doses of 30mg, the itching was gone. This stuff other generic brand is garbage.",ip
4,Doxepin,Urticaria,2.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"June 19, 2019",12,"Was prescribed Doxepin 10mg taken at night for hives and angioedema. I  had developed these symptoms after having my physical and which I was prescribed amoxicillin and clarithromycin.  Immediately  after started the doxepine I noticed that I was extremely groggy and out of it by the time I woke up and clearly it did not help with the itching because I was just as itchy when I woke up if not more because that is what woke me up.  I felt myself itching and scratching in my sleep and thought I was dreaming but I wasn't. Made me feel depressed like no one in the world liked me, gave me nightmares and I would randomly start crying for no reason. May work for some but I'll admit, I'd rather be itchy than depressed seeing as those I do not suffer from depression. Do your research on these meds before taking them, may cause more issues than what you had to begin with. I have been spending tons of money on all these antihistamines since 4/8/19 with no cause for the allergic reactions. Just irritating!",Kay
5,Doxepin,Urticaria,5.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"May 9, 2019",16,"I’ve had urticaria for 2 months on and off. I have taken every manner of topical and antihistamine offered by the dermatologist. Finally my GP suggested 10 mg doxepin in the evening for urticaria.I had a very strange reaction to this drug. The rash (which covered my back) disappeared instantly and completely within 2 hours. Then I fell fast asleep. Within 2 hours I woke up, very psychologically disoriented, and the rash had returned even worse than it was before. I calmed myself down, put some steroid cream all over my body and went back to sleep. The next day I was very nauseous and had a headache all day. It was such an extreme reaction so I will not take this medication again. Glad it works for others!",Itchy
6,Doxepin,Urticaria,10.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"June 15, 2018",15,"I just got my doxepin increased to 100 mg at bedtime plus get once a month Xolair injections.  It seems to be helping. I have been dealing with chronic uticaria for almost a year and nothing was helping until I saw the allergist specialist.  I'm not allergic to anything, he thought maybe stress is causing it but when I'm not bothered or stressed I was still was finding myself braking out. Until my 2nd dose of xolair I ask to increase the doxepin and so far its helping,  every now and then a couple of hives but not as bad as before!",Mommy 5
7,Doxepin,Urticaria,9.0,,"June 12, 2018",13,I have to take a meditation for breast cancer and developed awful hives. Nothing helped with the hives and my primary care doctor said let us see if this old time drug will help you. I took and thank God it worked. Hives are on hiatus.,Jr
8,Doxepin,Urticaria,10.0,,"May 21, 2018",13,"Had hives daily for 6 weeks straight, took doxepin 25mg and they were gone the next day. I was on steroids that worked good to but am off them now. It's been a week without one hive. It works, but agree with side effects. Groggy, sometimes into late morning. I feel like I'm a couple seconds behind on my actions.",Doe
9,Doxepin,Urticaria,9.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"January 11, 2018",11,"Doxepin is amazing for hives. While waiting for Xolair to work for my urticaria I was desperate to find some relief of the intense itching every single day and Benadryl could not keep up with it. I started twice a day usually 3 pills (25mg) and could go up or down as needed as well as other antihistamines. After 6 months on it, I only take 1 at night and am going to switch to (10mg) Doxepin. I would definitely recommend this drug for urticaria. Side effects were not nice in the beginning like nausea and extreme tired but got used to it. Also have gained weight but is getting better on lower doses.",Emj79
10,Doxepin,Urticaria,,Taken for less than 1 month,"January 10, 2018",6,"I was perscribed Doxepin for relief of an itchy skin condition. I suppose you could say it temporary relieved the itch because I was completely unconscious for the next 12 hours and unaware of everything, itchy and otherwise. I was groggy and zombie-ish for the next 12 hours, and occasionally had to reach for walls or furniture to keep from falling over. I feel like I lost a day of my life. Verdict: NOPE.",Adelthea
11,Doxepin,Urticaria,10.0,,"October 10, 2016",46,"I had hives for over a year since moving to a new environment.  After trying almost every antihistamine and taking 7 cycles of prednisone, I went to see a new allergist.  She started me on xolair injections and doxepin to help with the any breakthrough itching.  I started at 25mg at night and ended up at 75mg.  I haven't had a hive since starting on the xolair and 75mg of doxepin.  I am hesitant to decrease the doxepin because I have had the best solid sleep since I started taking it.  Seriously if you have hives I would definitely recommend trying the doxepin - it is amazing.",Itchyincali
12,Doxepin,Urticaria,6.0,,"May 9, 2016",24,"I've been taking 10mg for several months now, for chronic itching. It has helped ALOT although it has not gone away my doctor told me it will take time but eventually it will get better. It makes me very drowsy but I've gotten use to it now",LoveJade
13,Doxepin,Urticaria,10.0,Taken for 10 years or more,"January 29, 2016",72,"After suffering with chronic idiopathic urticaria for 20 years, a new Dr. put me on this old medicine which has a VERY strong antihistamine effect.  It stopped the hives dead in their tracks, and now, being on the medication for 22 years, I have yet to ever develop another hive.  This medication is a GREAT.  I've never used anything even remotely effective as this medication to prevent hives (even steroids wouldn't stop them!).  Doctors gave up on me and could never figure what the cause was/is.  Doesn't matter now as they completely under control.",Garyloveslucy
14,Doxepin,Urticaria,10.0,,"January 24, 2016",36,"Doxepin is a godsend for hives.But I have found several drawbacks for it.First, drowsiness. You need to take it before you go to bed. Probably even just slightly after dinner. Even then you will find yourself sluggish in the morning. Second, since it is an anti depressant, I tend to develop an I don't care attitude with it. My personality is to be that way normally and this exacerbates it. It isn't necessarily bad just something to be aware of.Finally, I find it inhibits weight loss. It doesn't necessarily cause weight gain, but, it causes me to sweat less when exercising. When I get off it I tend to lose weight pretty rapidly.But all the side effects are worth it to be hive free.",Oldstylin
15,Doxepin,Urticaria,8.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"March 22, 2015",41,Amazing!  I was put on Doxepin a few months ago and it has done wonders.  I used to break out in hives 4-5 times a day.  Now I only break out 1-2 times a month.  Very serious progress!,Paisley12345
16,Doxepin,Urticaria,2.0,,"March 17, 2015",28,"Very effective for treating Urticaria, almost completely eliminated my hives. Had to come off because doxepin caused major depression. Within three days of stopping Doxepin, my depression subsided.",Anonymous
17,Doxepin,Urticaria,9.0,,"November 19, 2014",27,I am 34 year old female.. I am on Doxepin to help me sleep.. I have had SEVERE eczema for years- NOTHING helps except prednisone ( on that now all the time too) but I couldn't sleep due to constant scratching.. Slowly increased Doxepin until Im now at 100mg taken at night ( sometimes depending how tired I am I only take 50-75mg) but Its my miracle pill.. Puts me to sleep ( almost instantly) and 99% of the time im not tired or groggy in the morning... I have heard however-there is possibility of weight gain and thinning hair at which both possibilities would cause me to look for a different medication..,Sarah 1980

19,Doxepin,Urticaria,5.0,,"December 14, 2010",36,"For sufferers of chronic hives (lasting longer than 6 weeks) this is likely a medicine you will use in combination with many others.  I have found it can help with the itching and helps get you some good sleep, so it may be a worthwhile addition to your treatment regimen.  Above all get a good team of doctors.",Anonymous
