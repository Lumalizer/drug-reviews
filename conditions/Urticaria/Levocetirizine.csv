0,Levocetirizine,Urticaria,1.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"September 28, 2021",0,"Xyzal (levocetirizine):This medicine is making me miserable. Have been through nose bleeding, depression, difficulties in concentrating, loss of short-term memory and I was lightheaded all the time. Practically I've been through the majority of the possible side effects that got mentioned. Sadly I didn't manage to relate my  personal health condition to this horrendous medicine earlier otherwise I would have already stopped taking this awful drug . Based on what I've been through, the risk of suffering from this drug certainly outweighs the benefits involved and thereby please walk away from this bloody thing",Jack.

A full tablet seemed to really dry me out. I was thrilled to see the tablets are scored! The this means that it has the same dose on each side of the score. Much greater experience taking half. Lots of people don't know that is reason it is scored. Half a Xyzal helps so much!  The cost is better when you have twice the dose in a bottle!! I'm really glad it's available.,Janee

It is getting worse with age (I'm 34).  Touching random objects, anything laying on or against my extremities, heat, etc.  Went to allergist finally as I thought I was having severe food allergies - they diagnosed me with urticaria, turns out I have no allergies, just 'reactions'.  I told them antihistamines have never worked for me, but they said with this condition it may be needed up to 4 times a day.  I started with zyrtec twice a day, which helped but I was too sleepy.    I have been on 1.5 xyzal am, 1 pm for over a month now and am mostly itch free for the first time I can remember.

I’ve spent the last 4 years of my life suffering due to side effects of antihistamines. These drugs are all the same thing. They make you feel annoyed, depressed, anxious, exhausted, dizzy, and just like absolute garbage! I thought xyzal, being the newer and better drug it was marketed to be, would be the miracle to save my life. However, it wasn’t. This drug is just as bad as the rest, possibly even worse. Also, keep in mind that xyzal is no different than Zyrtec. It’s literally just the left half of Zyrtec, the part of it that  actually works. It’s the same drug. If Zyrtec sucks for you, xyzal will too. Honestly I’m gonna go  back to claritin. It doesn’t stop my hives completely but I am at least not a psychotic depressed maniac on it.",Adim7

The next morning was back at the dr. and was nebulized in the office for 4 hours. She prescribed Zyzal 10 mg at night, and Singulair in the morning as needed. Worked wonderfully.

When I was finally prescribed Xyzal by an allergist my life was changed! As long as I take it every day, I rarely get hives. I still get some if I run or am in the sun without sunscreen, but aside from that, I'm free! I am so thankful for Xyzal, and no longer living in fear every day being ruined by hives.

Since taking these drugs I have developed urticaria. The dermatologist prescribed Xozal and a cream for 30 days which  was 100% successful with the urticaria. I believe that one of the aforementioned drugs that I mentioned was responsible for the urticaria. After a couple of weeks without the Xozal & the cream, the urticaria returned. Using the cream on its own does not stop the urticaria, but the Xozal alone is 95% effective. I now need to check with the urologist about long term use of Xozal.",Sospiri775
