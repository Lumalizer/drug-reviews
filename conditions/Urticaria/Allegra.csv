0,Allegra,Urticaria,8.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"March 19, 2020",6,"This is really a question than a comment. The question is for ""Trac"" who was going to post the results of his treatment, it was a while ago May 5, 2018. I am interested to know how and if it was treated. Thanks!",Daashee
1,Allegra,Urticaria,6.0,,"August 29, 2019",38,"I have chronic idiopathic urticaria, may have autoimmune component. It started 4 months ago after multiple days off bites by oak mites and maybe a spider or two.  I'm on 3 x 180 mg Allegra and 300 mg zantac in the morning plus 3 x 10 mg Zyrtec and 300 mg zantac at night.  Plus miscellaneous Benadryl here and there.  Hives went away for few weeks and now they are back.  Can't afford Xolair.  Not sure what's next.  This is craziness. Might have to research ""Vitamin D deficiency in chronic idiopathic urticaria""",CL

3,Allegra,Urticaria,10.0,,"August 10, 2019",38,"My sister in law whom is a M.D, recommended me Allegra daily for my urticaria. I was hesitant at first for the fact that I didn't want to begin my day taking pills. I guess I was waiting for my hives to clear on their own which till this day I still struggle. Allegra,   is my savior I take 1 every morning to relieve my itchiness and welts, they help me very much.",Red
4,Allegra,Urticaria,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"April 12, 2019",18,"I have eczema which cause awful flare ups on my hands and caused my skin to get dark . All the topical steroids I applied did not help heal the skin neither did it change the color. However with one allegra a day my skin instantly looked and felt better. Also, it always cures any respiratory allergies as well. I truly recommend this medicine.",Sm
5,Allegra,Urticaria,8.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"February 16, 2019",78,"I started getting daily urticaria in October 2018. At first, I just hoped it would go away, and I refused to take antihistamines, but after a month of itching and rashes, I started taking Allegra. The Allegra worked well; my rashes and itching were significantly reduced. However, Allegra is only effective for me at daily doses of 180 mg or higher. I tried the 60 mg doses; they helped but there was still itching and random rashes. With my doctor's approval, I eventually doubled the dose of Allegra to 360 mg daily. This dose is very effective for me. For me, side effects are non existent with Allegra. I have tried other antihistamines, but Allegra and Loratadine are the only ones that aren't noticeably sedating. Cetirizine is supposed to be non-sedating, but that isn't the case. If anyones has chronic urticaria, I recommend first trying the 180 mg dose of Allegra. If this isn't enough, talk to your doctor to see if it is okay to take the 180 mg dose twice daily.",bash-terminal
6,Allegra,Urticaria,,,"July 20, 2018",27,"Been battling Uticaria for 5 years and taking Certizine, Hydroxyzine and Zantac. Constant itching. Don't know why.  Never completely goes away unless I take prednisone which I normally don't use, but I will take for about a week to get some relief from the constant itching. I try, not very successfully, to not to scratch the itchy hives which I hate  with a passion. Because of the favorable remarks about Allegra I'm going to use this medication.  I've also been treated with Light therapy which has worked quite well in temporarily clearing up my skin.",Sonny
7,Allegra,Urticaria,8.0,,"May 5, 2018",198,"Guys, it works great for a temporary relief of the hives for sure.  Don’t ever settle for idiopathic if you get them often though.  I have been going through this for years myself, constant break outs, suppressing symptoms, now I’m done doing that.  I’m getting to the root of the problem, and the answer is going to integrative functional medicine.  This issue seems to be more gut related and it’s gonna cost me a fortune, but they have the proper tests to run to find out what’s going on instead of pushing a million pills on you.  Let me tell you, my issue and probably a lot of you have auto immune related things going on.  Don’t ever let someone tell you that auto immune means your body is attacking itself, I can promise you it’s not.  It’s your body trying to heal itself, that’s what our bodies are made to do in crisis.  I will update once I get my tests done.",Trac
8,Allegra,Urticaria,,,"January 10, 2018",57,"It's a great medicine for the hives I get Daily, other medicine were good but non drowsy allegra is the best solution. Now my worry is how can I get rid of the hives permanently coz if I don't take a pill a day then the hives start appearing back immediately. Any solutions?. My life is now dependent on this medicine. Can anyone please tell me the side effects of this medicine coz am taking it on daily basis.",Akash V b
9,Allegra,Urticaria,2.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"August 11, 2017",45,I am 47 years old and I have been suffering from urticaria since 2014. After lots of treatment now I am taking allegra 180mg twice a day...but only when I take allegra my itching reduces (does not completely vanish) but when I didn't take it again erupts.

10,Allegra,Urticaria,,Taken for less than 1 month,"July 1, 2017",18,"From past 1 yr I'm having chronic urticaria. If my diet is clean no hives occurs, it's due to food that  I eat. After months of steroids and h1 & H2 antihistamines I have recovered almost 70% now from past 3 days I didn't took any medicine, as I ate some oily food n chicken outside my hives have increased so now I'm taking Allegra 120 mg (half)tablet after reading all the above comments.Next review will be soon",Muneeb-India
11,Allegra,Urticaria,10.0,,"August 19, 2016",84,"I have suffered from severe urticaria for years, claritin and zyrtec never did anything for me. I tried oatmeal creams and baths , benadryl and any kind of anti-itch cream I could find, nothing works like Allegra and Pepcid, as long as I take it daily I'm hive free. ALLEGRA is the answer to Hive sufferers.",Hive free
12,Allegra,Urticaria,2.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"March 30, 2016",15,I have suffered from cold hives for about 10 years now and till this day I have not found a solution. Allegra does nothing for me. I take about two allegras everytime I step out my house and still get hives all over my face and body. Thats more than the recommended dosage for 180mg. I still have hope that theres a cure somewhere out there,Danniiee
13,Allegra,Urticaria,9.0,,"November 10, 2015",52,"I have chronic idiopathic urticaria and like a lot of other people on this thread I tried Benadryl,creams, oatmeal baths, changing soaps... didn't help. I tried Allegra for the first time last night and had almost instant relief. I still have some hives but the itching is far less intense and the hive are less red. I am glad I came across some of these reviews!!",Alexandriagal
14,Allegra,Urticaria,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"October 13, 2015",51,"I went to a local clinic to treat Urticaria and was given 60mg of prednisone on my cheek. It had no effect on my body and the symptoms even got worse.Then my doctor recommended to take Benadryl (H1 blocker) and Zantac (H2 blocker) altogether. I took both pills and it made me extremely drowsy (Benadryl) and Zantac actually alleviated my symptoms just a little bit.I woke up next morning and found out that Urticaria has come back.Then someone recommended me to take the Allegra (Fexofenadine 180mg) and it really works without any side-effects of drowsiness.I think Fexofenadine is god given allergy medicine. I tried Benadryl, Zyrtec and Claritin before. Their effectiveness on Urticaria is far less than Allegra.",Works incredible w/o side efct
15,Allegra,Urticaria,9.0,,"August 7, 2015",41,I recently had an allergic outbreak of hives ...My doctor prescribed prednisone 6-day pack and steroid cream.I tried benadryl first thinking it would help control the itching.  It did not.I was so miserable from the itching the hives caused I was willing to try anything.I came across this page about Allegra.   I was prescribed Allegra in the past and it worked really well for my seasonal allergies.  I decided to give Allegra a try ...  I'm glad i did!!!  It Stopped on the itching and cleared up 80% of my hives in 1 hour...  Thank God this is Over the Counter.Doctors always tell you to use Benadryl ... it will only make you sleepy and its not very effective at controlling the itch of hives.   Unless you take a very large dose.,Gabe773
16,Allegra,Urticaria,10.0,,"April 20, 2015",42,"I suffered from chronic itch all my life tried almost every other antihistimine to the point I had to start with prednisone every 3 months for a week to get rid of the itch over my whole body eyes running nose I would have such severe itch that I just could not function normaly got 4 hours or less sleep a day. I now use this medicine for 2 days now, after one hour I took the medicine I felt my eyes not itching and my skin feels much better to the point its liveable.  Now I hope this will keep working even after some time because all previous medication would only work a few days a week tops so if this will continue to work I can finaly start my life. I'm 22 years old and I finaly have new hope now thank you fexofenadine!",robin k
17,Allegra,Urticaria,9.0,,"April 1, 2015",48,"Had chronic urticaria 3 years ago, tried everything from Benadryl, Zyrtec, Claritin and nothing worked. Took a Allegra 24 hour and 70% of my hives have disappeared leaving me less itchy. Wish I would've found out about this site earlier to do my research. This is my first day on the medication, hopefully it will go away after this week.",JohnHivefree
18,Allegra,Urticaria,10.0,,"August 19, 2014",56,I have been suffering from hives on my face (very embarrassing) from food allergies for the last few years. Since I gave birth to my first child it became worse. Finally an allergist suggested I take 60mg of Allegra everyday and for the last week I have been almost 100% hives free. My face is so clear and white again! I feel amazing and confident again thanks to Allegra.,MariaNL29
19,Allegra,Urticaria,9.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"February 28, 2014",35,Best relief for hives. Prefer this over Xyzal.,Mr888
20,Allegra,Urticaria,9.0,,"December 11, 2013",77,"I was taking Zyrtec, Benadryl, Benadryl gel and Pepcid for hives. Nothing got them under control until I tried Allegra. I am amazed my doctor did not suggest I try it. I had a week of steroids which worked but the hives came back once I finished them and the doctor would not give me more (not that I want more) I was miserable--now it's tolerable. Still have no idea what caused the hives. I am 53 and have never had a hives outbreak like this.",Bamakama

22,Allegra,Urticaria,10.0,,"March 24, 2013",61,I finally found a medication that controls my hives. Ever since I was a kid I have ben battling hives that come and go every couple of years. Its the type where my face swells and hives all over. I've been through prednisone treatments and several other medicines that make me drowsy. Nothing works like Allegra. Definitely worth the price.,wranrox

24,Allegra,Urticaria,10.0,,"February 27, 2012",76,My husband got a very acute urtricaria on his whole body for 2 weeks. Nothing helped really to get rid of the burning patches. Benadryl caused more drowsiness then any help and additionally my husbands face was sweeling all over when taking Benadryl. Finally we got Allegra 180 mg pills. And just after the first Allegra pill all red patches on his skin and all swollen areas were gone for good as long as he keeps taking it twice a day 180 mg each tablet. This medicine is really great.,fanofallegra
