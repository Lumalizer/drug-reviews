0,Zyrtec,Urticaria,1.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"January 5, 2022",0,I stopped taking Zyrtec 2 days ago and was woken up by the uncontrollable itching last night all over my body. It was terrible. I tried to use a topical cream to control the itch but it got so bad I cut a pill in half and the itching went away within the hour. I wish I knew about this when I started taking a pill every day for the last couple years. I am going to wean off slowly and never buying this again. The fact they do not warn the user of this side effect of rebound itching is extremely concerning - who knows what else this is doing to our body.,Michelle
1,Zyrtec,Urticaria,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"December 27, 2021",0,"Unfortunately I had a severe reaction to generic Zyrtec last night.  I took 10mg before bed.  I woke up with a severe heartburn, nausea, and abnormal heart rhythm.  I took sodium bicarbonate to relieve the acidic heartburn.  I went back to bed only to be awakened with another severe heartburn, but in addition I was extremely dizzy, nauseous, cold sweats, sick feeling.  I went to the bathroom nauseous.  I barely made it back to bed as I was about to faint. Fortunately my bed isn’t far from my bathroom as I almost fell from faintness and dizziness.   My head was soaked in cold sweats.  In the late morning, I found out that there is a percentage of women in my age group 60’s that have fainted with Zyrtec who have taken it less than a month - in which I have - only taken it since my Patch Test allergic reactions since Thursday.  No other symptoms since the drug wore off.",beenfooled
2,Zyrtec,Urticaria,1.0,Taken for 5 to 10 years,"November 24, 2021",1,"I'm absolutely miserable right now... I've been using Zyrtec for almost 10 years because when I was younger I developed a condition called Dermatographia. When I would lightly scratch my skin it puffed up and create hives. The doctor told me to take Zyrtec and sure enough, my skin wouldn't puff up anymore. I continued to blindly take Zyrtec for almost a decade. Periodically, I would miss a day or two and would get very itchy, I thought this was my Dermatographia coming back. What I didn't realize is that the itchiness was a withdrawal symptom of Cetirizine. I probably could have stopped taking Zyrtec YEARS ago. It's been 4 days since I stopped and I have EXTREME itchiness everywhere on my body, even inside my mouth. I'm so sad to read this is a problem for others as well. I want the itchiness to STOP. If anyone is going through the same struggle, write a comment. I'm so upset that there is no warning to this miserable side effect anywhere....",TampaBayNative

I just did an experiment and lasted 5 days without but 4th and 5th were horrible.

I've had allergy testing, blood tests galore, thyroid examines etc. I'm now at the point where I don't know if Zyrtec just works so great or if I'm so addicted to it that I can't get off of it.

So my specialist suggested I take one zyrtec a day, but I was still having symptoms two times a week (remind you I was having hives and swelling every single day from morning to night) so even though I was having symptoms 2 times a week it was a relief but I was looking for a complete relief.

After my workout, I went to sleep at 7 p.m., woke up for an hour and then went to bed at 9 p.m. only to sleep the whole following day. I was unusually fatigued and sleepy. I'm going to try 2.5 mg today to see if that helps.",frustratedgirl

51,Zyrtec,Urticaria,7.0,,"April 22, 2008",13,I love this product. I've been taking the generic version lately and have had to take two with no symptom relief (still sneezing violently and itchy watery eyes).  I recommend Zyrtec as the first option.,SeanSargent
