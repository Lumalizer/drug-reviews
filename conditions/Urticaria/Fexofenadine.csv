3,Fexofenadine,Urticaria,8.0,,"April 10, 2021",6,"Effective for my dermatitis or ezcema and hives. It does take away the sneezy, watery nose and itchy eyes. I have been taking it for two weeks daily. Currently, my allergies are so terribly bad that I itch everywhere, even in my groin; it is embarassing. So I am stuck with this 180mg med. I used to have UV light therapy which  helped greatly. Now I live away from my dermatologist. I don't know what is worse, the anxiety side effects or my constant itching and redness on my skin, which sometimes turns brown when scratched. Pinetarsol soaks in a bath-tub helps temporarily. Any heat and sweatiness brings the urticaria back. Some pred cream prescribed doesn't really solve the problem. I really wonder what is the cause and the immunologist, dermatologist and GP can't tell me. Just saying that its pollens, creams, food and a host of other stuff causing it plus stress. I wonder whether I can take the COVID vaccine with such a problem. It's been 10 years of suffering.",Tannie

5,Fexofenadine,Urticaria,1.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"June 21, 2020",12,"I was prescribed fexofenadine 180mg daily for severe itching due to eczema but I also suffer from hay fever too. Initially worked great for the itching (I was talking it every other day at this point), however when hay fever season started I upped this to one tablet per day and began to experience horrible symptoms.I had heart palpitations, anxiety and had panic attacks for weeks before I realised that it might be caused by these tablets. I also have a heart condition (mitral regurgitation) and thought this was getting worse as the palpitations were horrible so was very concerned.After stopping the medication I felt better within a few days although the anxiety did linger for a week or so. Very scary experience!!!",Deedee

14,Fexofenadine,Urticaria,8.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"February 16, 2019",78,"Allegra (fexofenadine):I started getting daily urticaria in October 2018. At first, I just hoped it would go away, and I refused to take antihistamines, but after a month of itching and rashes, I started taking Allegra. The Allegra worked well; my rashes and itching were significantly reduced. However, Allegra is only effective for me at daily doses of 180 mg or higher. I tried the 60 mg doses; they helped but there was still itching and random rashes. With my doctor's approval, I eventually doubled the dose of Allegra to 360 mg daily. This dose is very effective for me. For me, side effects are non existent with Allegra. I have tried other antihistamines, but Allegra and Loratadine are the only ones that aren't noticeably sedating. Cetirizine is supposed to be non-sedating, but that isn't the case. If anyones has chronic urticaria, I recommend first trying the 180 mg dose of Allegra. If this isn't enough, talk to your doctor to see if it is okay to take the 180 mg dose twice daily.",bash-terminal

16,Fexofenadine,Urticaria,1.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"January 20, 2019",12,Been suffering from chronic idiopathic spontanous uritacaria for 3 months now. Drs prescribed this after I had taken week prednisolone and ranitidine (zantac). I started on 120mg which didn't work then drs increased my dosage to 180mg twice a day that did not work. I've just not bothered taking it unless necessary now and I think benadryl gives me slight comfort. Fexofenadrine is absolutely useless for me. This was the same medication I was given last summer due to hayfever and it did not work at all. Terrible,Hussein
17,Fexofenadine,Urticaria,8.0,,"August 1, 2018",9,Fexofenadine was first prescribed to me for chronic urticaria with angiodema five years ago by a private Dr in the UK. Symptoms disappeared for five years but came back this summer.

19,Fexofenadine,Urticaria,8.0,,"May 5, 2018",198,"Allegra (fexofenadine):Guys, it works great for a temporary relief of the hives for sure.  Don’t ever settle for idiopathic if you get them often though.  I have been going through this for years myself, constant break outs, suppressing symptoms, now I’m done doing that.  I’m getting to the root of the problem, and the answer is going to integrative functional medicine.  This issue seems to be more gut related and it’s gonna cost me a fortune, but they have the proper tests to run to find out what’s going on instead of pushing a million pills on you.  Let me tell you, my issue and probably a lot of you have auto immune related things going on.  Don’t ever let someone tell you that auto immune means your body is attacking itself, I can promise you it’s not.  It’s your body trying to heal itself, that’s what our bodies are made to do in crisis.  I will update once I get my tests done.",Trac
