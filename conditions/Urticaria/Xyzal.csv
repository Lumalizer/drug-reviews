0,Xyzal,Urticaria,1.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"September 28, 2021",0,"This medicine is making me miserable. Have been through nose bleeding, depression, difficulties in concentrating, loss of short-term memory and I was lightheaded all the time. Practically I've been through the majority of the possible side effects that got mentioned. Sadly I didn't manage to relate my  personal health condition to this horrendous medicine earlier otherwise I would have already stopped taking this awful drug . Based on what I've been through, the risk of suffering from this drug certainly outweighs the benefits involved and thereby please walk away from this bloody thing",Jack.
1,Xyzal,Urticaria,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"April 3, 2021",5,"Worst anti-histamine ever.  It clears up sinuses and even some post-nasal drip, but it makes one extremely tired and achy the next day.  Not motivated to do anything.  I took it 3 days, never again.",Jimbo

4,Xyzal,Urticaria,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"October 10, 2019",15,"I felt like I had lock jaw, felt tired & sleepy, my tongue was swollen, I kept pinching the side of my tongue every time chew my food, itchy, yellow urine.",UM
5,Xyzal,Urticaria,9.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"July 13, 2019",19,I decided to try Xyzal when I was unable to calm the itching I have. A full tablet seemed to really dry me out. I was thrilled to see the tablets are scored! The this means that it has the same dose on each side of the score. Much greater experience taking half. Lots of people don't know that is reason it is scored. Half a Xyzal helps so much!  The cost is better when you have twice the dose in a bottle!! I'm really glad it's available.,Janee
6,Xyzal,Urticaria,9.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"July 3, 2019",43,"I have suffered from hives as well as intense itching without rash for 15+ years.  It is getting worse with age (I'm 34).  Touching random objects, anything laying on or against my extremities, heat, etc.  Went to allergist finally as I thought I was having severe food allergies - they diagnosed me with urticaria, turns out I have no allergies, just 'reactions'.  I told them antihistamines have never worked for me, but they said with this condition it may be needed up to 4 times a day.  I started with zyrtec twice a day, which helped but I was too sleepy.    I have been on 1.5 xyzal am, 1 pm for over a month now and am mostly itch free for the first time I can remember.   Can't believe OTC medication was all I needed for this endless nightmare.",Windsicle
7,Xyzal,Urticaria,1.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"July 3, 2018",17,"Xyzal is horrible. I’ve spent the last 4 years of my life suffering due to side effects of antihistamines. These drugs are all the same thing. They make you feel annoyed, depressed, anxious, exhausted, dizzy, and just like absolute garbage! I thought xyzal, being the newer and better drug it was marketed to be, would be the miracle to save my life. However, it wasn’t. This drug is just as bad as the rest, possibly even worse. Also, keep in mind that xyzal is no different than Zyrtec. It’s literally just the left half of Zyrtec, the part of it that  actually works. It’s the same drug. If Zyrtec sucks for you, xyzal will too. Honestly I’m gonna go  back to claritin. It doesn’t stop my hives completely but I am at least not a psychotic depressed maniac on it.",Adim7
8,Xyzal,Urticaria,10.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"May 12, 2018",18,"I developed Hives after gallbladder surgery. Benedryl worked on the surface for about 8 months. Then I went to an allergist and she had me stop all meds for allergies. That night I thought I was going to die. Lips were swollen eyes were and I didn't sleep. The next morning was back at the dr. and was nebulized in the office for 4 hours. She prescribed Zyzal 10 mg at night, and Singulair in the morning as needed. Worked wonderfully. I can played around with dosage taking at night. I can go 1 night without it and I have to take it the next night. 72 hours with out a dosage and I will have a breakout start. Told the Dr. that I will take this the rest of my life, and I don't mind.",VMR

10,Xyzal,Urticaria,10.0,,"June 18, 2017",8,"It has been the only antiallergic that really works for me. I take it every other day. It is just fantastic and so happy that now is over the counter, now I can get the 80 tablets bottle and not deal with insurance and is cheaper than the out of the pocket payment that I used to pay.",Saly71
11,Xyzal,Urticaria,2.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"June 10, 2017",4,I was hoping that it would help with the itching from psoriasis but I got very little to no relief.  I took it at night like the directions instructed but I still could not get a good night sleep and during the day I still had severe itching.,Cajun65
12,Xyzal,Urticaria,9.0,,"June 4, 2017",34,"I suffered from hives caused by friction, sunlight, temperature change, exercise, and showering for over 10 years, getting increasingly worse as I got older. I hardly had a life -- I couldn't exercise or go outside without breaking out in painful, burning hives. Claritin, Zyrtec and Benadryl only helped a little. When I was finally prescribed Xyzal by an allergist my life was changed! As long as I take it every day, I rarely get hives. I still get some if I run or am in the sun without sunscreen, but aside from that, I'm free! I am so thankful for Xyzal, and no longer living in fear every day being ruined by hives. The first few days I was drowsy, so I take it only at night.",alyiov
13,Xyzal,Urticaria,4.0,,"April 7, 2017",8,Have used it only 4 days. The first night I felt quite sedate and went to sleep easily. The following nights were just the opposite  Have great difficulty settling down and getting to sleep. I take it about 9 pm and would like to be asleep by 11:00.,MollieH
14,Xyzal,Urticaria,9.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"March 24, 2017",6,"Following the insertion of two stents to treat a serious occlusion of the arteries, I was prescribed the usual cardiac drugs plus omeprozole, and a year or so later Lasix to counteract the usual old age swelling of the prostate. Since taking these drugs I have developed urticaria. The dermatologist prescribed Xozal and a cream for 30 days which  was 100% successful with the urticaria. I believe that one of the aforementioned drugs that I mentioned was responsible for the urticaria. After a couple of weeks without the Xozal & the cream, the urticaria returned. Using the cream on its own does not stop the urticaria, but the Xozal alone is 95% effective. I now need to check with the urologist about long term use of Xozal.",Sospiri775

16,Xyzal,Urticaria,8.0,,"September 2, 2015",53,"If ever there is an award for the most irritating/embarassing illness, urticaria would (must?) definitely be a contender. Diagnosed with chronic urticaria about a month ago, and suffered immensely (redundancy at play here :). Nothing really worked, until a dermatologist prescribed Xyzal about a week ago. Told to drop all forms of medication - anti-histamines and ALL supplements, among others - and just take Xyzal. Hives acted up on first two days but have been free (almost) of hives for five days. Early days, but keeping fingers crossed that this will be a permanent solution. Will update.",YusY

19,Xyzal,Urticaria,10.0,Taken for 5 to 10 years,"December 9, 2014",50,"This medication is excellent! I have had horrible angioedema (a type of urticaria where the hives form under the skin) since I was ten years old from an autoimmune disease and have gone through several different medications, but this once has worked the most effectively. And I can tell how well it works because when I forget to take it, the hives show up within about 12 hours after the missed dose and once I remember to take the missed dose, within about two hours, it feels as though I never had angioedema at all.",coriiic

21,Xyzal,Urticaria,10.0,,"December 4, 2012",30,Hives and itchy skin and very bad hand itch that cased to to scratch. I used to get them every other day for 2-3 hours I used to lock myself in the room and itch and itch and itch then. I was told about Xyzal from my father-in-law. Life is so good with Xyzal. I only wish this medicine is known to more people who suffer from itch and hives that make life so painful. But when Medicine like Xyzal is created. It's very good medicine that can cure allergies or itchy skin.  I just take one tablet every 2 days and sleep like baby and feel the best next mooring.,Anonymous
22,Xyzal,Urticaria,10.0,,"August 25, 2011",45,"I have had hives my entire life.  I finally saw an allergist and he did tests.  He took me off of all medicines and put me on Xyzal.  I took the Xyzal three times and I have not had a hive since.  Seriously.  I had my first hives at 4 months and had hives everyday for forty six years.  I do not know what Xyzal did but it fixed me.  I stopped taking Claritin and Benadryl and Zyrtec.  Took Xyzal for three days.  It made me VERY sleepy.  I can't even take a normal Benadryl dose without falling asleep, though.  I had to take liquid Benadryl, one teaspoon, if I wanted to stay awake.  I slept twelve hours with my first dose of Xyzal and about 8 hours with the two successive doses.  Then, I never had a hive again.",Anonymous

After a severe outbreak of hives, and a visit to my Doctor, he put me on Xyzal. I can say I'm about 95% hive free.  I still have some hives but they're not as many or as large.  It is very early with this treatment to say that it will continue this way.  But, for the first time, I am hopeful.  I will return to this forum to give updates.",Estelle A.

25,Xyzal,Urticaria,8.0,,"January 22, 2011",21,"I have been suffering with Auto Immune Chronic Urticaria with Angioedema since August 2010. I am so over these HIVES. I was also diagnosed with a mild case of (ITP) Idiopathic Thrombocytopenia (low platelet count) in August as well. Since then I have been on a roller coaster with these hives.  One day I am hive free, the next day I wake up with swollen lips then a few days later my arms, back and legs are covered in hives. Since August I have been on Benadryl, Atarax, Singular, Zantac, Zyrtec, Claratin, methylprednisolone just to name a few.  A few days ago I looked on the internet and saw Xyzal. I immediately called my allergist and asked for it. I couldn%u2019t believe that it was $113.99 for 30 tabs. It was worth a try. Today is day number three on the medication and I do notice a BIG difference. I still have a few hives here and there but overall, it is a LIFE SAVER to me. I have not noticed any major side effects so far. I have been a little drowsy and I am shocked at that because NOTHING makes me sleepy.

27,Xyzal,Urticaria,7.0,,"June 16, 2010",15,"I started developing an outbreak of rashes all over my body about two years ago. Since then my GP has prescribed the usual antihistamine cetirizine and hydroxyzine.  I noticed my rashes didn't subside totally after I took them both, but when I was prescribed Xyzal, I noticed it lowered the inflammation of my skin and the itchiness level was greatly reduced too. Since then I have been taking Xyzal together with Atarax and I find it to be quite effective as a combination. I have been taking Xyzal on a daily basis ever since.  My rashes come back sometimes, but I have no choice since there are no newer antihistamine other then Xyzal.  My doctor has never prescribed me Allegra.",Anonymous

My hives have come back about 4 different times, lasting up to a year.  I have been on Xyzal for about 2 months.  I take Benadryl, then an hour later I will take the  Xyzal.  I take Benadryl at bedtime.  This is the first time in the 30 years that I feel they are under control.  For anyone with chronic hives, its worth a shot.  I have no side effects as of yet.

32,Xyzal,Urticaria,9.0,,"November 30, 2009",17,"Within two days of starting this drug my Delayed Pressure Urticaria, DPU, came under control. It controls it so far to about at the 95% level. I had a couple of major flare-ups the first day I took it, but I suspect the levels had not built up in my blood yet. I have had one headache but unknown if this drug caused it.  My allergies are also under control. The Urticaria still appears a little but much less in size, scope and no itching or raised welts. No feelings of tiredness for me, in fact it kind of speeds me up. I'm amazed that a cousin of Zyrtec can do so much more. Zyrtec didn't touch the hives before, even when taking up to triple the normal daily dose. If you have hives give it a try.",Reborn

I have tried every antihistamine on the market and was almost about to give up ever finding something that could help relieve the hives. Finally my doctor put me on Xyzal and it is the only antihistamine that has ever worked for me. I've tried some other medicines and none of them seem to do anything. Since I have been on the Xyzal I have hardly had any outbreaks and if I do I hardly ever suffer from severe itching and discomfort. I've been taking it everyday now for almost 4 months with no serious side effects. I would recommend that anyone suffering from chronic urticaria try Xyzal.,Anonymous
