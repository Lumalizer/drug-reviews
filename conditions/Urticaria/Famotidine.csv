0,Famotidine,Urticaria,1,Taken for less than 1 month,"January 1, 2022",3,"I took this to stop an overreaction of my immune system to a virus that is causing a pandemic, it worked immediately for the 3 to 4 days but then I got severe muscle pain and weakness and my joints felt decrepit in my hips, legs, knees and feet. I could barely walk and my gait was that if a 90 year old. I am athletic and do my own yard work. I also had severe sadness and hopeless that felt overwhelming. I finally stopped taking it and my mental health is back on track. My legs are slowly normalizing. I hope I get back to normal. I am taking charcoal pill and hydrating to remove the toxins and taking vitamin b complex. This medicine is damaging to me.",Evey
1,Famotidine,Urticaria,10,Taken for 5 to 10 years,"July 22, 2021",3,I have been diagnosed with chronic hives since 2011. I was prescribed a slew of different meds from prednisone to chemo drugs. Prednisone helped but is dangerous to be on long term. My allergist tried a combo of Pepcid (Famotidine) and Xyzal (Levoceterizine) and it has made all the difference. I have been hive free for 8 years  I have no side effects or other issues from being on the famotidine long-term. My insurance covers and I get from walmart $1.97 for a 30 day supply.,KV

3,Famotidine,Urticaria,5,,"February 2, 2017",21,"While I found this awesome and it got rid of my hives, I experienced a rare side effect it seems. I totally lost my ability to control my bladder. It has become so embarrassing, even though no one sees or knows about it.... kinda personal, ya know. I cannot go anywhere with out worrying about my bladder and sometimes I have left the store as my bladder gives me NO warning and then its a matter of how fast I can get to my car before anyone notices that I wet myself. It's horrible. I have stop taking this and will gladly suffer from the hives that have been randomly occurring since I was a teen. I'm in the 40 - 50 age.",Anonymous 12
