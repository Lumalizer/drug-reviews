After 4 months with not one day not covered, our immunologist got her into Xolair (2 x 150).  Thank goodness after the 3rd dose (monthly), it worked and she’s been hive free ever since.She had her 4th dose last week & it’s changed her life (thank goodness).She will continue on this dose for several months and will then look to increase the period between doses (to 5 weeks etc).Thank goodness in Australia it’s covered by the PBS.I highly recommend this product.  I have written my comments because like so many I was constantly reading reviews etc.",Nat

Was dealing with hives for 2 years, and after seeing several doctors(at the ER) and trying about 12 different meds nothing worked. I couldn't be active at home because I was in so much burning and itching pain, and the same goes for me at work. Because of the hives I was tired all the time, and being lazy.Finally I had enough and went to see my family doctor before I decided to do something much worse to myself, and he told me what it was and he directed me to a skin specialist.She gave me a injection of Xolair and in 3 days hives were gone completely, I was no longer tired and lazy.I was supposed to go for my 2nd dose 6 weeks ago but something got messed up with the paper work and all the hives, tiredness, and laziness came back. I contacted the skin specialist and she is going to give me another dose tomorrow. Xolair saved my life.",Stephen

Whatever! I tried everything including 4 Allegra a day, Singulair, Pepcid, Doxepin,  Xyzal and the dreaded Prednisone. One trip to ER because of anaphylaxis. I am miserable. My new allergist started me on Xolair. Just got my 2nd dose and honestly after each dose, I flared up worse than when on my daily regimen of antihistamines. I am still waiting for my miracle. Unfortunately, I am experiencing back pain and knee pain. Although I do suffer with pain already, this pain is much worse and constant. I am not using a cane to get up when I sit down.

8,Xolair,Urticaria,9.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"March 5, 2021",6,"Works very well for chronic hives. As a treatment I rate it a ""9"". With the first two injections I saw immediate improvement.For cost I rate it a ""1"". The monthly co-pay for the prescription with Blue Cross Blue Shield PPO is $2273.54 thru the Walgreens Alliance RX pharmacy the BCBS policy requires us to use. The co-pay does not apply to my annual total out of pocket limit. Physician's service for administering the injections is not included in the co-pay billing for the prescription.$27,282.48 annually as a co-pay for Xolair is out of reach of the majority of Americans, including me.

11,Xolair,Urticaria,10.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"November 22, 2020",11,"Xolair has changed my life for the better and I have been asymptomatic since starting monthly injections.  I had chronic idiopathic urticaria (CIU) and angioedema for the past 20 years.  I had been trying high doses of antihistamines, NSAIDs, acupuncture, basically anything to stop the itching and swelling.  At one point, I was put on prednisone, only to have the CIU come back after tapering off.  Then I worked with the doctor to test Xolair.  It has worked amazingly well. I get injections once a month and for the most part am asymptomatic.  I have no side effects. Sometimes before an injection, I will have itching, but the next injection quickly alleviates symptoms.  Xolair has been transformative at changing my quality of life.  I am so much happier and healthier now.",CK

Eventually got approved for the monthly Xolair & have been going into hospital monthly for 2x150mg injections into the stomach.

I know the discomfort of severe hives so very reluctant to stop injections in fear of it returning but I am now starting to have severe knee pain & struggle to lift myself when I kneel down .

I was hoping to be off all the antihistamines and prescription Singulair by now but still having to take them all with the Xolair .  I don't know how much longer I can stay on the Xolair,  my worry is what will happen to me once it is stopped,  I worry will go back to being covered in hives again .

My first month I was tapering off of prednisone so I wasn’t sure if XOLAIR was working. 2nd month it did nothing, and then finally half way through month 3 my hives went away!!! Only if I continued to take antihistamines. It’s almost like it activated the antihistamines that hadn’t worked before. At the end of the month I would notice maybe 6 - 10 hives show up like it was wearing off, but that was nothing compared to 500+ before. Then I had my 5th shot, and started getting VERY bad hives again. The antihistamines slightly work, but the XOLAIR just STOPPED working like it did in month 3/4?

30,Xolair,Urticaria,4.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"December 7, 2019",9,"I had hives starting July 2018 and zyrtec & zantac did not help but prednisone did. After 2 months insurance approved xolair. I was told up front it would take 3 xolair injections to feel relief and it did. After 8 months of xolair I began having side effects of chills, cold/painful hands and feet. After 11 months had nasal congestion, sore throat, headaches and cough that have lasted 4 months with no relief. They start to get a little better then get worse after injection but provider refuses to admit is xolair causing it. I am considering dropping xolair to see if hives are gone and unfortunately the only guidance  on discontinuing is from John Hopkins in that it wears off in 6 to 12 months and has not cured hives. Hopefully my body has when I stopped. I believe this is a big money maker for my provider who charges me $250 just to give an injection.

34,Xolair,Urticaria,6.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"September 19, 2019",21,"When I read Itchyallover’s review, it was as if I'd written it myself. It took effect 2 weeks before the 5th injection, but 10 days later it stopped. The clinic nurse said it often wears off a few days before the next one is due. It took effect again 3 days after the 5th injection but I've already had two bouts of CIU since then. I can’t rely on Xolair yet, that’s why I gave it a 6. I'm due for my 6th injection in 10 days & I’ll review again if things improve.Only acupuncture plus a Chinese bitter herb drink twice a day has kept me sane. I avoid all dairy products, reduced sugar, & only drink green tea or water. Like Itchyallover, I have run through all my savings for acupuncture 3 times a week & the cost of herbs. I also take Warfarin, so I can’t take Prednisone.Give me the pain of every surgery I’ve ever had (ten), than 1 hour of itching; it reminds me of a biblical plague.

51,Xolair,Urticaria,10.0,,"June 14, 2018",25,"I started getting large, itchy and painful  hives 5 years ago. I have had multiple allergy tests. I was put on Xolair and it worked wonders. I lost my  insurance so now I can not afford xolair without insurance. My condition has worsened. This past month I have gone to ER.  The hives are the least of my concerns now. My tongue, lips, throat swell and I go into full blown anaphylaxis. The only thing that helps is epinephrine, a steroid, an antacid and Benadryl all given intravenously. It’s sad. I will keep searching for help.  A nurse in one ER spoke with me once I had stabilized. He recommended that I read a book called eating  for your blood type as well and histamine intolerance. I now avoid fast foods, and all sorts of pickled and cured foods as well as any foods that sit around because they contain additives and preservatives. I’m afraid to eat now and I’m craving sugar like mad. I believe I am histamine intolerant and may have some mast cell condition situation ",Dlight1411111not

I had two allergist trying me on prednizone, singulair, doxepin, something like that (in short it was a crazy pill regimen) and that didn't even alleviate the hives in the slightest- just made me depressed and jittery. Until one day I went to a new doctor and he let me try xolair. Immediately after the first shot, my hives were 80% better, and by the second shot 4 weeks later, I was 100% no hives. My skin is super sensitive in general so sometimes I still get itchy or if i go past my 4 weeks some hives develop again, but it is soooooo much better than waking up red and blotchy and itchy every freaking day. Xolair has really changed my life. Although, I wish it was more definite when I can get off of it.. I think you kind of just have to wait for your body allergies to change (meanwhile xolair will still suppress the hives). All in all I would still get on it if I had to do it again.",Aly

Xolair destroys our immune system totally whatever we built from our childhood. Some time when you get a cold, people will have fever tablet also for precaution.

We live states apart and I've had some similar allergic reactions to some of you but I had some luck in discovering the foundation for it. It's a ""rare"" but becoming much more common allergy to mammalian meat and all mammal meat bi-products caused by a tick bite called Alpha Gal allergy. Itchy hands and feet and delayed reaction are big indicators for it. There is a simple blood test to find out and then you have to avoid mammal meat and their products like the plague. You can still eat poultry and fish, etc but for some severe cases, you have to be a strict vegan about EVERYTHING. You would not believe the amount of everyday products that use the fat from a cow or the blood of a pig, etc. pretty gross actually.

There were four treatments at four week intervals followed by two 150 mg treatments at four week intervals.

93,Xolair,Urticaria,10.0,,"February 26, 2016",39,"I have had chronic hives every day all over my body since 1982.  I went to many doctors and had all kinds of tests and no one could find out why.  I researched the internet a few times a year to see if there was any new research done that would prove to be helpful.  Last year I read about  Xolair  After a long discussion with my doctor, we decided to try Xolair injections.  On the day of my first injection, I had a swollen hive 4"" by 6"" on my back that was very painful. After the shot, it started to shrink and I haven't had one single hive since then.  I am thrilled.  No side effects.  My health insurance covers almost all of the cost.  I am so thankful to finally be relieved of so many years of suffering!",MarMar23
94,Xolair,Urticaria,7.0,,"February 10, 2016",72,"I have had daily hives from June 2015 until October 2015, Despite prednisone and mega dose of Anti-Histamine, my hives kept coming every single day. I started xolair in October 2015 and took my first 150 ml shot in October 30, 2015, then In November27, 2015 and then in December 23, 2015. Unfortunately after my 3rd shot and on Christmas day, my hives came back with vengeance and I kept having them daily. The in January 13, 2016, I took 2 shots (300 ml) and still nothing. My hives have been getting worse on a daily basis. I am due for 2 shots next week again. I hope it will work out. Did anyone experience that? Xolair works for couple months then stopped working? Do you think it will work again after few more shots?",Hives_Nightmare

My Dr. suggested that I try Xolair. I have had my 2nd injections today and have had no decrease in my hives. I have read that it may take 2 or 3 months before it kicks in but I was sure hoping that I would have some relief in the first month, especially because of the cost of this drug. I will continue for a couple more months to give it a fair chance.",Grandma G.G.

Antihistamines and steroids didn't do the trick and I was miserable.  Within 2 months of being on this I am completely hive free.  I wouldn't be able to function without it.  Love it!,Hive patient
98,Xolair,Urticaria,10.0,,"August 13, 2015",77,"I have been living with chronic debilitating hives with angioedema for over 30 years!  After my first injection of Xolair I have been almost virtually free of hives for 1 yr and 1 month!  I got a few hives once and got another injection and they were gone.  It has changed my life completley!  No weight gain.  Just a bit more tired than I use to be but that is fine with me.  I can bike and do 1000 more things than I could ever do with hives.  The pain was ungodly and I don't know how I lived that way and hope I never have to again,",hihosilver
99,Xolair,Urticaria,10.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"August 5, 2015",55,"I had CIU for a year and half before my first Xolair shot.  For six months, I never went a day without hives, experienced the lip swelling and face swelling once (never want that experience again).  I was told by my allergist that I had exhausted all types of therapy so Xolair was my last and only option.  My first shot was in January, three days later I was hive free.  I took monthly shots for 6 months, no hives so we decided to try 6 weeks between shots, no hives.  It is August now - no hives!  Yes it is expensive but not being covered with hives from my head to my toes makes that worth it.  I would agree that it has made me gain about 10 pounds and I workout just about every day. I look like I am pregnant but not ready to give up yet.",Sandy A

This last month on the 3rd week ( week-10 days before I was due to receive my shots) my hives came in pretty bad. My ankles and feet start to itch then it works its way up my legs to my mid torso. I have to say I'm panicking since receiving my shot yesterday, and taking 2 benadryl even 4-5 hrs and zyrtec I'm covered with itchy hives!! Can it be that our bodies become  immune to the xolar?? Please let me know because I feel like my freedom is taken away from me right as I was so happy and confident being hive free.",Th3610

Then after the 4th shot, they came back and stayed with me for another 3 months.  I just had my ninth shot and I've been hive free for 3 months.  I've put on weight that I can't explain and I'm having more foods give me gas.  These are not good side effects but better than the constant itching.",feelingmuchbetter

104,Xolair,Urticaria,9.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"August 10, 2014",56,"I have had chronic idiopathic uticaria for over 17 years. Since I was 3, all I can remember is the stress, pain, embarrassment, etc that this condition has caused me. Now, at age 20 I'm finally receiving the medicine I've been hoping and praying for. For a while, Doxepin combined with many different types of antihistamines worked to reduce the amount of hives I would get. Now, only prednisone will temporarily help my hives. Prednisone has caused me to gain weight. Nothing has worked to reduce my hives other than the prednisone, until I found Xolair. The shot did hurt, but it's worth the pain. Towards the end of my first shot, I did get a lot of hives. I'm hoping the next few reduce them even more. I am so happy to have Xolair!",E123

I experienced terrible stomach problems (constant gas and bloating) and weight gain of about 10 lbs that I cannot seem to lose. (I'm small so 10 lb is a lot) It's is hugely annoying- I feel pregnant, and I am very active and fit and have always been able to maintain my weight, and now I can eat almost nothing and work out and it's still there. Going off of Xolair, hope this problem resolves itself. Annoying!",MomWithHives

For the past two years, I've had chronic refractory idiopathic urticaria, nonresponsive to antihistamines and with angioedema. Four months ago, I began an omalizumab treatment course of 300 mg every 4 weeks. Within days of the first injection, I immediately noticed a huge decrease in the redness, size, and swelling of the hives, and since then, I've noticed a gradual reduction in the symptoms. I've been hive-free for almost a full month now. The only downside: without insurance, this is extremely expensive. But for me, I consider it absolutely worth it.",JennyTalksDrugs

I've been on bi-weekly shots since the start of this year. All I can say is that is a MIRACLE medication! I'm no longer mutating into a monster with head to toe hives, swollen eyes & lips, gasping for air & praying the Epi-Pens do their job before I die. Having been on corticosteroids for so long, I blew up like a parade float & started to have problems with bone degeneration & cataracts. 2 weeks after getting my initial injection; I said farwell to steroids!!!
