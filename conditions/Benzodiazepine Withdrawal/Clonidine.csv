0,Clonidine,Benzodiazepine Withdrawal,2.0,,"February 15, 2017",20,"I have had a decade long experience with opiates and all the so called remedies for withdrawals . Suboxin, works as long as u wait until u have some withdrawals before dosing if not it puts u into withdrawals, god awful pain in minutes..subutex won't put u in withdrawals bc it doesn't have the 2nd ingredient which is a blocker . I realize things tend to work differently on different people. If taken properly I've never heard of subox not working. I want to be clean of it all ! Recently hit rock bottom and was able to find a free detox center which gave me Clonadine/ Motrin / Tylenol . Several doses of clondine made my vision fuzzy but once my withdrawals kicked in the pain was unbearable. My legs hurt so bad I wanted to cut them off !!",Bee tee

It doesn't seem to help much but I still have bottles of it that I keep for sleep,headache prevention and for opiate w/d",sopranofan
