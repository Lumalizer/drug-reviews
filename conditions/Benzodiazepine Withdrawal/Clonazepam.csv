0,Clonazepam,Benzodiazepine Withdrawal,10.0,Taken for 10 years or more,"March 25, 2022",1,"Started 0.5mg twice a day in college for panic, whilst on an SSRI.  Over years increased to four a day.  25 years later, after weaning off the antidepressants, Doc and I suggested attempting coming off of clonazepam too, carefully.  I agreed and couldn't get lower than 0.2 twice a day -- it serves a purpose in my life that I cannot live without.  When the pandemic struck I saw less of Doc and she cut me off the clonazepam without supervision, I was trapped in my apartment, sparing food and toilet paper... eventually I didn't need anymore toilet paper and after God-knows-how-many months I lost a third of my body mass.  When I passed out washing my briefs in the tub, which I thought was due to lack of food (probably) I called the cops.  After endless pleas to my doctor and family for help, the cops are the ones who saved me.  They somehow found some social workers and people who could prescribe me clonazepam again.  The social and professional damage is irreparable.  I'm 50.",Mr. Guitar
1,Clonazepam,Benzodiazepine Withdrawal,2.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"February 23, 2022",0,"I took Clonazepam for a year and the dose was 0.25 once a day for anxiety and insomnia.  I decided it was time to stop.  I am probably at around week three and I wasn't expecting severe withdrawal symptoms as I felt that my dosage was low.  It has been a rough few days with insomnia, nausea, and some anxiety.  I think doctors should probably look to alternative medicine as most anxiety medications have side effects and are difficult to withdraw from, not to mention that they just aren't good  for you long term.  The lure of the benzos is that relief is instant, with minimal side effects initially.  Looking forward to feeling better, and have learned a very hard lesson.  I am going to pursue natural methods to ease my anxiety and work on coping strategies instead of taking medications that just mask the problem.",Nina
2,Clonazepam,Benzodiazepine Withdrawal,9.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"February 13, 2022",2,"In the fall of 2019, I was placed on 1mg Clonazepam at night for anxiety and panic disorder. After a year, I went down to 0.5mg because 1mg seemed too much. I was very happy and did absolutely great on this dose, for about a year with no side effects but getting the medication re-prescribed was always a mess. Doctors would take too long and I’d run out of pills which would put me in terrible withdrawals. I finally did a gradual taper to get off of the medicine, cutting down 1/8 a pill at a time, every two or three weeks. I’d experience withdrawals each time I adjusted down, and even now, even though I’ve been off of it for a month, I still get what I call waves of withdrawals that sometimes last days: headache, tremors, nausea, panic, shame, fits of rage, confusion, etc. They do at least go away eventually and give you a chance to breathe before the next wave occurs but it’s no picnic.",Anonymous
3,Clonazepam,Benzodiazepine Withdrawal,10.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"January 8, 2022",0,"I was prescribed 4 mg of klonopin a day for panic attacks and anxiety. I took 1 to 4 (1mg) klonopin a day for over 4 years.  I quit cold turkey after 4 years and I had no side effects that I noticed.  It is concerning when it seems that everyone is having devastating side effects coming off klonopin...and some with very small doses.  I rate klonopin a 10 and I think it was incredibly helpful for me.  I now take it when I have major anxiety.  I'll take it for a year straight and sometimes for just 1 or 2 days.  I usually stop taking it when I feel I don't need it and I've never tapered off it.  I will take ¼ gram to ½ gram.  Then I just stop after I feel ok.  The time between taking klonopin regularly is usually 6 months to several years.  Klonopin has been a major help for me. I would highly recommend the drug for anxiety and panic attacks if I hadn't read these posts. I read that klonopin is taken for intoxication as well. I get no ""buzz"".  If I take >1mg I get tired though.",Red
4,Clonazepam,Benzodiazepine Withdrawal,1.0,Taken for 10 years or more,"December 30, 2021",1,"My story is one of finding out how to taper clonazepam. I'm almost 55 now and feel like this drug is  just really bad for me. I've been on it since 2009, so approximately 13 years as well as on 2 other benzo's and 75 mg Seroquel to sleep.My initial starting dose was 7.5 mg!!! I had no idea what kind of drug this was. Years later I found out it's an anti-convulsant and I was also taking 180mg oxycodone a day for 8 years because of having muscle aches which made it impossible to walk 400 meters. A quarter of a mile. In the last few years I've had infarcts in the brainstem (pons, thalamus). In 9 months I quit the oxycodone and considered myself clean. The clonazepam I tried taking 1 tablet of 0.5g a month less.Now I only use 2mg at night along with 5mg nitrazepam and 100mg oxazepam and the Seroquel. Now I visit a USA website and find out how dangerous it can be to rapidly quit the remaining amount of benzo's I still take. But I feel sick all day every day.",Donna
5,Clonazepam,Benzodiazepine Withdrawal,7.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"December 12, 2021",0,"My experience with Xanax as been devastating. I am,  well was 280 lbs and I was taking  way too much a day for years and years. My tolerance is so high to the point where I couldn't just stop or I would have died. I went to rehab to taper but they wouldn't let me when I got there. Some of these rehabs will tell you anything over the phone to get you there and when I asked them about it they told me they do that to save lives... smh. Most will tell you what you want to hear just to get you in the door for your insurance money this has happened to me twice. But long story short I went there 3 diff times to states away from where I live in NY. So it's not like I could leave or whatever so I just stayed and I've been clean from heroin for over 8 years and just got mixed up in a unit that deals with opiates not benzos. So I was the only one in my unit that was there for benzos everyone else was alcohol opiates and Crack cocaine So I'm now struggling with the withdrawal I can't just cold quit",Jeremy

I went cold turkey October 2021 and it has been one of  the worst experiences of my life.  The withdrawal symptoms have been severe anxiety and panic attacks, paranoia, crying, depression, loss of appetite, lack of patience, and can't focus.Prior to taking clonazepam I was taking Buspar for anxiety but when it stopped working  I was put on clonazepam.  I'd avoided benzos for anxiety for over a decade due to its addictive probability.  When the Buspar stopped working I crashed into a severe panic anxiety filled meltdown and I just wanted to feel better so I agreed to the clonazepam one of the worst mistakes of my life.Don't take this drug it's horrible and should be taken off the market.",Renee Smith
7,Clonazepam,Benzodiazepine Withdrawal,1.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"November 19, 2021",2,"I was prescribed 5mg at bed time for a year because of severe PTSD. At first it helped with acute anxiety. Nobody explained or warned me of how this drug works, so I just blindly took it, thinking that such a small amount is harmless. Had I known better, I wouldn't have taken it every day. Six months in I became agoraphobic and couldn't feel anything: happiness, love, excitement, etc. It made me tired, lose my hair, coated my tongue, caused pain, and the worst sense of impending doom and anxiety. This drug is so dangerous and downright evil. It's only meant for short term use. I will NEVER touch the stuff again! If I could give it a zero I would.",Neveragain!

10,Clonazepam,Benzodiazepine Withdrawal,10.0,,"October 18, 2021",1,"I have used Clonazepam on and off for the last 4 years, each time not using them for any longer than two & half months and tapering at the end of each session, approximately two or three times a year.  It addresses my anxiety and anger issues, however after 2 months or so I feel emotionally numb which isn't healthy.  I finally sort out a psychiatrist and after lengthy discussions had a diagnosis of PTSD, OCD, anxiety and insomnia.  I explained how I had been treating myself and he advised Remeron/Mirtazapine.  This kicked in after two weeks and my PTSD episodes, OCD were and remain controlled.  For the anxiety, they do work quite well, however, I have had to resort to Klonopin, when I have had 'break through anxiety attacks'. I am now facing tapering the Klonopin, I am not apprehensive, especially as the Remeron will assist during the reduction process. I have had 15mg a day, so the process (for me) is 7.5 for 4 days and 3.25 for 4 days. After which I will be good.",PTSD/aniexty/OC
11,Clonazepam,Benzodiazepine Withdrawal,1.0,Taken for 10 years or more,"October 9, 2021",2,"Now I'm worried about a few people here - especially Chrissy.  Read Dr. Peter Breggin's book on psychiatric medication withdrawal.  He is a renowned psychiatrist often referred to as ""the conscience of psychiatry."" You can do it yourself but remember that the time it takes to withdraw without too many symptoms is dependent on how long you have been taking it and the dosage level you've been on.  It took me two years to w/d from .5 mg after 20 years.  I also took melatonin to ease withdrawal - very helpful!  When you reduce and you experience the type of symptoms described here just know that they are temporary and there WILL come a day when it will be OVER.   You are not alone!  My love to all that come here.  Stay Strong!",Hayden

If you use them like I did (my pain doctor prescribed it for me for CRPS) you will find yourself a year later addicted to a drug that only makes you feel worse even when it's not causing withdrawal. It only worked for a few weeks anyway. I was on opiates for 24 years and have been on benzos for 16. I went through opiate withdrawal successfully. It was a nightmare but I've tried many times with benzos and it is so very much worse. I've given up on quitting and just take the lowest maintenance dose I can.

I started taking Clonopin at my doctors advice seven years ago when I went through a terrible experience two years later while still on the Clonopin I had an awful car accident which ended my career and a lot of my life activities. I startedib   2 mg to begin with   I’m very slowly I have come to 1mg this last wean from 1.25 to 1 has been horrible but how come no one here mentions the Ashford protocol it’s the best manual in the world. It has strict instructions about how to wean off any amount of any benzo. The  success rate is phenomenal because as you taper more clonapazem they add a diazapem at night. Why?  Diazapem is much easier to remove when you are tapered.  Make the taper last as long as u want (stay on dose longer if still feeling bad) but have a plan!!!

On 0.5mg twice a day for five years, I wasn't told by my doctor that it is addictive and not for long term use.  I told the doctor l wanted to stop taking it and he advised me to wean myself off it.  After 3 months of reducing it l stopped completely and during the weaning process never experienced any withdrawal symptoms.   Within a week they started, dizzy, ringing in my ears, tremors, terrible headaches, nausea, lack of appetite and weight loss.  Every time l feel a little better all of the symptoms come back.  I am told that this  can go on for months.  My advice, don't start on this drug.",tabby

To be honest I'm not sure how I never went to the hospital. Unfortunately I have a high tolerance for pills and managed to run a business and maintain a somewhat normal life. On top of everything I'm bipolar with a major addiction problem. Finally decided that I need and want a life without drugs.

Worked great but as a side effect. Not it's intentional use. I decided to taper off to .75 mg,  and now currently on 0.5mg. The withdrawals I'm experiencing are palpitations, insomnia and a warm sensation that travels throughout my extremities. I feel so out of it. I feel depressed. Please don't take this drug. Taper off slowly.  Good luck to all of us trying to get off any benzo. Wish I would've done some research but I was desperate and trusted a professional.",Eddy
74,Clonazepam,Benzodiazepine Withdrawal,1.0,,"July 13, 2019",70,"UPDATE (2019-07-13): I am 3 weeks in to my tapering plan (reducing 1/4 mg every 7-10 days) and on track.  I'm down from 2mg to 1.25mg and it's been manageable but not comfortable.  It's taking a full week to accept the lower amount without symptoms of headache, tight jaw, diarrhea, & general discomfort.  I have continued to work & live normally.  Original post:My doctor informed me that this drug, which I have been taking for years for general anxiety, is now on a list of ""reported drugs"" every time it gets refilled.  She suggested I wean off of it and use Lexipro instead which is not physically addicting.  I knew I was addicted to Clonazepam because even a 1 day delay in refilling cased major withdrawal systems such as my hands shaking and headache.  I was taking 2mg a day and I am tapering (1/4 of a 1mg tablet) each week.  If all goes well I should be to 1mg in 4 weeks.  Then I will re-evaluate how to get off the 1mg.  So far just tapering from 2 tablets to 1 3/4.  Will update.",JJ
75,Clonazepam,Benzodiazepine Withdrawal,8.0,,"June 22, 2019",26,"I took clonazepam to help me sleep with my epilepsy. The first night was awesome; I slept until 10:00 am.  I never go into deep sleep by the way.  A few weeks ago my neurologist told me I had to quit because of all the regulations concerning this drug. I would have to see her every three months and possibly see a psychologist.  That being said, I was told to quit taking it.  So far my sleep is crummy as always and I'm sure it will get worse.  So far, I've noticed some tingling sensations that I didn't have before.  I'm a runner so I stay in shape fairly well.  Coinciding with that I've noticed that my heart seems like it's faster at times.  All I can say is it worked for me but it sounds like a lot of people have had problems.  I could have quit stone cold but I knew the dangers of it.  My doctor had told me specifically not to.  Based on the ramifications of seeing a psychologist alone, I would stay away from it.",Biff

I went back to my doctor just and he took me off Valium and put me back on my Klonopin today is the first day I've taken of Klonopin. They work great for anxiety but stopping them cold turkey to be put on something else will put you through major withdrawals between the side effects from the Valium and there withdrawal symptoms from the Klonopin.

Not knowing any better I tapered for 3 weeks (like I would have for an anti-depressant) and ended up in severe withdrawal.  I should've taken 1-2 years to taper in that it changes your brain function; it's like taking a poison.I took the last portion of the 2mg dose I was prescribed in August, 2014.

They have a new IV drug you can use. It will detox you in a week. And you are supposed to be fine plus its a benzo blocker also.

Writing this review in April 2017, I've been on it for a month shy of ten years.  I started at 0.5 mg twice a day and that's the dose I'm still on.  You have to resist the urge to increase the dose and instead work on yourself.  There will be bad times...you just have to accept that and work to minimize them.And don't drink on clonazepam.  It multiplies the effect of alcohol to an astounding degree and I find it to be extremely unpleasant.  Giving up drinking even socially wasn't hard, though when I refuse drinks people assume I'm a recovering alcoholic.

To those people suffering panic attacks, you have to conquer it naturally and with SSRI meds, I wouldn't take the time to come here and write this if I didnt want to help anyone, benzos are like any other illicit drug, they blind you and make you think you just took 5 steps forward, when you come off it you are 100 steps back.GL",anonyy
