0,Tranexamic acid,Menorrhagia,10.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"January 13, 2022",3,"What a game changer! Day 2 and 3 used to have me changing a super plus tampon every hour, sometimes less  It was a nightmare because I am a teacher and you can't just leave the class to scoot to the bathroom. I experienced dizziness and weakness from loss of blood, and my iron level was at 9. After starting tranexamic acid (normal schedule of 2 pills, 3x per day) I can go 2 to 4 hours between changing a super plus tampon on my heaviest days. I feel so much better (shakiness and dizziness is gone) and I am much more comfortable leaving the house without fear of being away from a bathroom. No side effects for me.",Rachel
1,Tranexamic acid,Menorrhagia,3.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"September 27, 2021",1,"I'm 26 years old & I'm currently on Jadelle due to a c section I had almost 3 years ago. I had my usual period for 7 days which was medium-heavy bleeding no pain. However, less than 2 weeks later I started bleeding again. This time it started light-medium and down graded to spotting with lots of clots. I've been experiencing a lot of pain in my back, butt, legs, pelvis and stomach. I'm wasn't bleeding a lot but I've been experiencing so much pain that I can't leave my bed some days. This has never happened to me b4. I am on day 27 (bleeding). I finally went to my GP but due to lockdown I didn't really get to talk with him about specifics. I got a blood test done (waiting on results) and have been on this medication for a week now. I am in less pain (aside from the first two days I experienced intense painful leg cramps) but the bleeding hasn't stopped and is becoming heavier. It also makes me really sleepy",Lisa
2,Tranexamic acid,Menorrhagia,9.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"August 26, 2021",1,I was prescribed tranexamic acid for very heavy periods. I'm mid 40’s and started getting extremely heavy periods a few years ago. I would not be able to leave the house from Day 1 to Day 3 unless I had access to a bathroom every 2 hours. I have a few small fibroids and my gyno recommended trying this or have an ablation. I chose this. It does lessen my period if I use full dose daily but I get pretty bad headaches and horrible low back aches. I think I will try Motrin with it to see if that helps those two issues. This is my 4th month using it. I would definitely recommend this to women who have excessive bleeding. It works.,Alibaba
3,Tranexamic acid,Menorrhagia,5.0,,"June 14, 2021",1,"I have been taking Tranexamic Acid since March 2021. I take these tablets 3 times a day, for 3 days each month. I am in the Month 4 and I am experiencing weight gain, stomach cramps (I have been getting cramps in my stomach they feel like period cramps) and bad face spots/acne. I am not on any other medication or any hormonal/contraception pill. I feel like the only explanation are these tablets.. even though they do not affect hormones. The tablets do work, they have decreased my blood flow, made my periods shorter and along with feminax which controls the pain it does work. I just do not know if it's worth it for these side effects.",Hkiox
4,Tranexamic acid,Menorrhagia,8.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"May 13, 2021",16,Hi everyone. I had a myomectomy last year in August 2020 as I had a huge fibroid which was 15cm. Just before this surgery for one month I suffered from heavy periods and one day I had to get admitted in emergency as the flow was uncontrollable and I was changing my pads within 5 minutes with large blood clots. To stop this bleeding doctor gave me injection of tranexamic acid and then before surgery I had it for 2 days. It’s an effective medicine no doubt and after surgery I am still taking it coz of heavy bleeding on 2nd day but what I noticed is that it is making my each cycle more heavier than previous. Initially I started taking only 1 pill on 2nd day. But on 4th month I had to take 10 tablets for 4 days . I don’t know what is this but tranexamic acid makes blood clots and after taking this I started passing more clots with less bleeding. Can anybody experienced the same please tell,Doll
5,Tranexamic acid,Menorrhagia,9.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"May 8, 2021",10,"Lysteda (tranexamic acid):So grateful for this drug.   I don't think I realized how much my heavy periods decreased my quality of life.  I would have to say no to outings-especially hikes or water activities that fell on the wrong day. I would miss multiple nights of good sleep because I was anxious about bleeding through or busy getting up to go to the bathroom multiple times.   The missed sleep and anxiety about bleeding through at night and during the day would affect me for the rest of the week.  For more than a decade I battled anemia.  I was in a fog because of this.    For the first time, with only taking intermittent iron, my iron and hemoglobin levels were normal recently.    I do occasionally get a mild headache with this drug but worth it as it is very mild.",KSLP

7,Tranexamic acid,Menorrhagia,10.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"April 4, 2021",0,"I was bleeding heavily for more than a year 12-18 days every month. I have two fibroids which caused the heavy bleeding. My DR. advised to go for surgery but I refused after reading the effects of  missing uterus. I could change the pad almost every 30 minutes. A few months back she prescribed Tranexamic acid. I was hesitant to take it because she had previously prescribed some medication for shrinking my fibroids and and the manufacturer called it back.  The first trial, my periods lasted for only 4 days and were light, the next month it was 7 days and still not heavy.  I was always in pads and non- stop infections. The side effects I got, were some back and joint pain, but bearable. I feel I got my life back.",Jackie
8,Tranexamic acid,Menorrhagia,5.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"January 26, 2021",1,"I am 42 years with a large fibroid, my Doctor suggested I try Tranexamic Acid first so I don’t rush into a decision to undergo surgery.  The first 3 months were fantastic, my bleeding reduced by 70%, I would take 2 tablets three times daily.  The fourth month just passed and following my period 3 days I did not bleed and then I started bleeding again ever since and at present has lasted 8 days so far, the bleeding is more spotting, once or twice a day which is brought on by stomach cramps.  I cannot say for sure it is due to the medication.  I have never experienced prolonged bleeding and decided to google Tranexamic Acid side effects and came across this review post, which has been a comfort knowing I am not alone.   My Doctor has said if Tranexamic Acid does not work to then try taking a low dose combined contraceptive pill, which I will now try.",Linda
9,Tranexamic acid,Menorrhagia,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"January 18, 2021",3,Lysteda (tranexamic acid):I’ve suffered from heavy bleeding for years now. I do have uterine fibroids. My Doctor has tried every medication under the sun for me and this was my last option. Unfortunately it did not work for me. I started Lysteda the first day of my cycle x 3 for 5 days and my cycle was actually worst. The clots were unbelievable and cramps like I was in labor. Very disappointed I thought this would be my miracle medication. Glad it works for some. Never taking it again.,Dream
10,Tranexamic acid,Menorrhagia,4.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"October 4, 2020",5,I started taking tranexamic acid six months ago due to horrible bleeding from fibroids. I am 44 and my doctor recommended this over birth control. For the first few months it worked reducing my extremely heavy periods allowing me to get closer to 3 to 4 hours per tampon. After about 5 to 6 months on tranexamic acid it isn't working anymore. My period has decided not to stop at all. I ended up having to wear at least a regular tampon every day for the entire month and then my period restarted heavier than ever even while taking the medication. I guess I will have to get these fibroids out. I will try birth control first of my doctor allows it although she felt it was risky. My side effects of the medicine were cramping headaches and possibly some heart palpitations.,Done with this
11,Tranexamic acid,Menorrhagia,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"October 3, 2020",5,Heavy periods since having a child 7 years ago and have endometriosis. Birth control pills make me depressed. Battle to keep iron levels normal. I find tranexamic acid cuts back my blood loss by half. I can go hiking without flooding. Function better at work. Just started them and have been told to take them for first 3 days of period. Usually day 3 is my heaviest. So far very happy.,Kj
12,Tranexamic acid,Menorrhagia,10.0,,"September 23, 2020",6,"This ranexamic drug changed my life with hideous periods.

13,Tranexamic acid,Menorrhagia,7.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"September 20, 2020",2,"Tranexamic made me a tad nauseous but it was worth it. Before this drug I had so much anxiety around my period because it was so heavy. It meant I couldn’t function and lived in constant fear of embarrassment. I even couldn’t attend school sometimes because it was just a nightmare to deal with. My period is still heavy on this medication but not as bad as before, at least I could get through class without too much stress about leakage. It got me through school.  I only reason I stopped taking this medication because I got diagnosed with endometriosis so I’m exploring other more effective treatment options.",M.
14,Tranexamic acid,Menorrhagia,9.0,,"August 22, 2020",86,"About a year ago my periods become unbearable. I would always leak at night, even with a super+ tampon and night pad. Doctor prescribed tranexamic acid 500mgs tablets to be taken two at a time, three times a day during my period. For me this seemed a lot, so I tried taking just one tablet twice a day to see how I got on. It worked wonders, I didn’t leak at all and went through half of the tampons/pads that I usually would. However...1-2 weeks after that period, I have been spotting a lot. In 15 years of periods I have never experienced spotting, so this seems be a side effect of the tablets for me (even though it is not listed as a side effect anywhere). The uterine lining still has to be shed every period, so perhaps this is continuing to happen after the tablets are out of my system if it wasn’t able to during that period due to the tablets. I haven’t been able to find any info on spotting while taking tranexamic acid anywhere, so I’m wondering if anyone has experienced the same thing.",Cathy

This medication was very effective for me - very noticeably reduced bleeding, to a bit under half the normal volume. I took it for 3 days but the flow noticeably increased again when I stopped (fairly abruptly) so then took it for a further day which did the trick. I didn't experience any side effects with this drug, it was nothing but good news for me. There were more little clots in the blood which didn't bother me.",Amamama
16,Tranexamic acid,Menorrhagia,10.0,,"June 15, 2020",31,"I was prescribed tranexamic two three times a day in January and it changed my life. I was having to change my clothes up to 7x a day bleeding through supermax tampon and night time super plus pad every hour. I also began to feel lightheaded, shakey and weak and like I was dying in. The first day I took transexemic acid I saw major results and it has been working to give me what I assume periods should be like sometimes I wouldn't have to take all three doses after day 3. It changed my life. So I have been on them since January this is my 6th cycle, thing is I am not taking them so far this time as I am barely spotting only noticing when wiping a colour change to a dark brown which means old blood. I am not sure why this has happened not complaining it is impossible that I am pregnant so it must be a result of taking this for 5 cycles. Looking to see if it builds up in the body or something. Prefer this way round but tbh part of me feels uneasy like where's the lining of uterus if not coming out.",Nikki

The 3 doctors I saw could not figure it out. I had a friend tell me that her friends periods were very heavy due to big fibroids in her uterus. I started taking Tranexamic Acid and in 2 weeks I was 50% better!! After 5 weeks I was completely normal again. I love having a healthy body!! The Tranexamic Acid completely cured my heavy bleeeding that was causing the anemia! If a normal woman's periods were 100% mine used to be 120%.

I am 39 and have 3 children.  I had been bleeding for 60 days with large blood clots. I tried a progestin only because as an estrogen and progesterone birth control and neither worked. I was delirious too on the birth control due to its hormones. I was moody, depressed, delusional. My doctor put me on Lysteda (transexamic acid) I took it for the 5 days 6 pills a day and at first there was absolutely no change until day 5 the bleeding was lighter. I called my gyn and told her it reduced to spotting. She said that’s a good sign I was thinking no I want it gone not reduced. Low and behold day 8 after finishing the treatment day 5 my period was off gone. No spotting or bleeding when I urinated. Nothing up in there at all I was so shocked. It worked.",Nikki
19,Tranexamic acid,Menorrhagia,10.0,,"May 11, 2020",36,"On round/month 3 of the lysteda for extremely heavy bleeding. It was a life changer for me. Before,I was bleeding heavy and fast and going through a super plus every hour, sometimes even sooner. Up all night running to the bathroom, bleeding through several sets of clothes and sheets and had to buy hospital like pads for the bed because I would even bleed through towels. I couldn't drive farther than 30 minutes (which I often need to) because I couldn't trust what my body was going to do.This med gave me my life back during that time of the month. I wish I had gone to the dr sooner.To note, I have always had quite heavy periods, but about 3-4 mos ago, they got really bad.-Enough where going to the dr was important. It turns out I have a fibroid embedded in the muscle in the top part of my uterus likely causing the extra heavy bleeding.I hope anyone reading this makes sure to get regular checkups if you can and ask a lot of questions to your Dr.",kitten
20,Tranexamic acid,Menorrhagia,10.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"May 8, 2020",10,"I have had very heavy, painful periods since having children. Tried the pill to reduce bleeding and skip periods but the various types didn't agree with me anymore. Then tried the nuvaring but it made me feel anxious and didn't really help the bleeding. Gynecologist diagnosed that I had weak uterine muscles that weren't effective at shedding lining or clotting so prescribed tranexamic acid to take 2 tablets 3-4 times per day, starting on the first day of my period until period ends. I took 2 tablets 4 times per day the first time and had 40% reduced bleeding but still somewhat painful and felt a little unwell the first day. The next period I have taken 2 tablets 3 times per day. Still some cramping, easily handled with anti inflammatory drugs and have not felt unwell. Bleeding has reduced by at least 60%.

My first period was 75% lighter within an hour.  I only took it the first 3 heavy days.  Period ended like normal.  This month my period is barely there and I haven’t even taken it.  I’m on my second day and it started to pick up a little so I took the medication.  With in a half hour it’s more like spotting than a period.  I love this medicine and wish I would have found it sooner.  The only side effects I have experienced are the tiredness the first time I took it and the cough I seem to have gotten after this second time I took it.

I went in to have an ablation as an in office procedure but the dr could not get into my cervix so I could not have it done. The dr told me about this medication as an option to try.  I was afraid and did not  take at first after getting the RX.  About 3 months later I was at my wits end so decided to take and am so happy I did.  My bleeding is down by 50 to 60 percent.  I really only need two pills twice a day on my heaviest days to control things and to feel normal again.  I have been able to do so many more activities and have not had to miss work due to the heavy bleeding.  I am very busy at work and in and out of meetings all day and this has helped me so much! This also helps my cramps I think because my uterus is not contracting as much due to less blood.  It’s an amazing drug and has really changed my life,Jeannie
34,Tranexamic acid,Menorrhagia,8.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"July 11, 2019",16,Started with very heavy periods about 4 years ago at 39. Always had reasonably heavy periods & was on contraceptive pill for years but periods just escalated. Was then diagnosed with fibroids & given tranexamic acid. What a relief! I went from using super plus tampons & super pads & leaking within less than 2 hours to changing every 4.  My gyn then tried me on medication to shrink the fibroid - biggest mistake ever!!! It stopped my periods for the 3 months I was on it but I didn't realise the womb lining continues to build up. The day after I stopped taking it I got 3 really heavy periods in 1 go & basically lived on the toilet for 4 days. So went back on the tranexamic acid & could breathe again. I do have major cramps for first few days but always did so a hot water bottle & paracetamol & ibruprofen together take the edge off so its manageable. I still sleep on a towel and have an alarm to wake up to change early am but I can live with that for 1 week a month.,P

37,Tranexamic acid,Menorrhagia,10.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"March 14, 2019",1,"I'd always had heavy periods since I started, but when I was around 14 they rose in intensity & were joined by sharp pains about where I believe the ovaries are. Not to be gross but my periods would fill heavy pads, were slightly thick in consistency & ruby in colour. I got weak, pale & confused so a locum dr prescribed me 3x500mg tranexamic aicd (TXA) 3-4 times a day for 4 days starting on day 1 of cycle plus 1x5mg Stemetil as antiemetic (sickness/nausea). I took the TXA 1x500mg on the first day of my period with another a day or 2 later if I needed it because I was scared if I got injured I'd bleed out. My periods were still  dark but less volume, cramps remained but were manageable. It stayed that way until I was 17  years old (being on Microgynon twice and then Depo-Provera has upset my uterus, it would seem!) I actually stopped taking it within a year of starting.

At this point, I've opted to contend with 2 days of heavy bleeding and with a cycle that last 4-5 days, as opposed to taking the medication with extended periods, headaches and diarrhea; that could last 8-9 days. The plus/pro of the medication is that my periods are lighter when I am taking the medication, however it stays on much longer.",Sabrina0826
85,Tranexamic acid,Menorrhagia,7.0,,"October 14, 2015",22,I took the medicine for two cycles. The first time only for two days and the second only 3 doses.. Not a fan of medication so I was trying to take as little as possible.. It took away the extreme heavy bleeding so I was happy with it .    I was hospitalized last week due to a bad pain in my side what I thought was appendicitis and after a cat scan and a few days in the hospital I was diagnosed with ischemic colitis which they believe was caused from this drug..so I of course would never take it again. Wondering if anyone else has had a similar experience.,Danamustard

I started Lysteda two cycles ago and although its helped lower the bleeding tremendously, they have also discovered I'm no longer ovulating. Although the medicine has worked wonders, I have gone ahead and opted for the hysterectomy as the dr says its the only thing that will fix it.

Do not delay taking the pills on time after you begin taking them each cycle or you may gush!
