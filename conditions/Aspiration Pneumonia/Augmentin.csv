0,Augmentin,Aspiration Pneumonia,1,Taken for less than 1 month,"March 31, 2018",12,Augmentin caused severe neurological issues with my mother where she exhibited stroke systems without having one and was very lethargic and lacked motor function.   My father became very nauseous with severe headaches.   I don't know why this drug is pushed on elderly people and want to tell everyone to beware of it!,Anonymous
