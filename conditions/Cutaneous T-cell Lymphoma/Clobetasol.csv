0,Clobetasol,Cutaneous T-cell Lymphoma,9,,"August 29, 2019",5,"I've used Clobex on my rash areas for years now. Although it doesn't totally clear up my entire body, it keeps the disease at bay. If I really have a bad outbreak, I go in for light treatments to clear my skin. After that, I use the Clobex to keep the small areas as clear as I can. The medicine is expensive and medical insurance, nor Medicare will pay for it. Look for coupon deals to reduce the cost.",Nikki
