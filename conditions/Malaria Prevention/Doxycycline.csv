0,Doxycycline,Malaria Prevention,1,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"December 8, 2019",5,"Worst medicine ever. I had to take this for malaria prophylaxis. You start it 2 days before your trip to the area that has malaria, while there and then 4 weeks after you leave the area. The 2nd day after starting, I had absolutely no appetite and mild nausea. During the trip, I had pretty bad nausea. And after the trip, the nausea had worsened into sporadic vomiting. Always easy to blame the doxy, since the symptoms were always concurrent with it. With or without food, at any time of day, and whether or not I drank it with lots of water. It's been more than a week since I stopped it, and now I get intermittent episodes of nausea with rare vomiting. I'd rather have malaria. 13/10, wouldn't recommend.",Dox
1,Doxycycline,Malaria Prevention,1,Taken for less than 1 month,"August 23, 2019",5,"Came to Tanzania to teach for the month of May this year and was given doxy as Malaria prevention.Was sick as a dog  for a my full month there, couldn't eat much, sinus headaches, vomiting, diarrhea, fever, chills, spent most of my time not teaching lying in my room feeling sorry for myself...Just came to Tanzania again and forgot to start my doxy before arriving, the first morning I took it the cramps started again, the diarrhea and fever chills. I'm glad I made the connection and looked the side effects up! Stopping this medication immediately.",Changa
2,Doxycycline,Malaria Prevention,9,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"August 28, 2018",2,"So I read the reviews here before starting my prescription of doxycycline (100mg once a day, for 6 weeks), and I was terrified. I’ve never taken antibiotics before. I usually took it after breakfast with a lot of water throughout the day. I experienced no side effects whatsoever, except for occasionally feeling fuzzy headed/ unable to concentrate. I was in Ghana at the time so it also could have been other factors such as diet. Overall, I didn’t notice any side effects of taking this medication. I would recommend. Some others in my group refused medication and in fact ended up getting malaria.",Lex

4,Doxycycline,Malaria Prevention,5,,"June 26, 2011",6,"I used Doxycycline for several months while in Afghanistan. It seemed effective in preventing malaria, however it caused a skin rash on my face that looked like an acne outbreak. Most others I knew taking Doxycycline did not get this side effect.",Anonymous
5,Doxycycline,Malaria Prevention,9,,"January 14, 2011",8,"All my family have used Doxycycline for malaria prevention. My son was ill on the second day, but this could have been totally unrelated. He was fine with continued usage.",pippo.au
