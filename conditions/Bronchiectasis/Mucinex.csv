0,Mucinex,Bronchiectasis,,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"October 4, 2020",6,Mucinex is great. I was taking all kinds of medications for a pulmonary problem. Went to Mayo Clinic  for the problem. I have bronchiectasis and was told never take an antihistamine but use mucinex a decongestant. I never looked back. When a doc tells me to take an antihistamine I say no. One time I took an antihistamine and had a problems for 3 months. Never again,Anonymous
1,Mucinex,Bronchiectasis,1.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"January 30, 2020",6,I have tried all the versions and dosages of this product.  They describe it as loosening mucus.  It does ABSOLUTELY NOTHING!  I have now read the tests and found out it doesn't even work better than a placebo.  Just wasted a couple hundred dollars.  Such is life.,Starsplat
2,Mucinex,Bronchiectasis,8.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"October 7, 2019",13,Works great for thinning mucus in the lungs. People with bronchiectasis may need to double up the dosage. People with a flair-up may not notice a big change at first as itâ€™s gentle acting.  Check with your doctor of course but this is a fairly safe medicine. I use it daily to keep passages clear.,Crjn
