1,Ventolin HFA,Bronchiectasis,9,Taken for less than 1 month,"November 22, 2014",9,"for never being on an inhaler before this works very very well. I've had a pretty bad cough for almost 2 years that was diagnosed as rhinitis and we tried nasal sprays and allergy medications this is like a breath of fresh air in my lungs. I'd recommend it, just watch for dry mouth!",Jillian51894
