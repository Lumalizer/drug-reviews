1,ProAir HFA,Bronchiectasis,10.0,,"January 31, 2019",5,"I was diagnosed with bronchitis after one nurse said oh you just have a head cold. This went on for a week and I got worse and finally went to urgent care and the PA told me you have a bad case of bronchitis. He put me on a Zpack, prednisone, the proair inhaler and a non-narcotic cough medicine. I have finished the Zpack and prednisone but still take the cough syrup at night and use the inhaler during coughing attacks which are less frequent. I was so bad the first 3 days of Bronchitis I coughed constantly and took Robitussin around the clock every 6 hours and it did not help. I could not sleep as my coughing woke me up constantly thru the night . I work in cubicles, 4 per cubicle. One lady coughed constantly for a week and a half. 2 weeks later I was sick. The following week our 3rd cubicle mate was out for a week. We found out 2 people had pneumonia. I live in Utah where we have an inversion every winter (pollution hanging over the valley making people sick).",MamaCoughs
