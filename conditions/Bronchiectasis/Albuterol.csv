3,Albuterol,Bronchiectasis,3.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"February 19, 2020",3,ProAir RespiClick (albuterol):This is a new drug for me. I was surprised I had to inhale the medication. Thank goodness I don’t have asthma. I would be frightened to death trying to inhale this medication during an attack. I’m being treated for complications after pneumonia. I did feel/ taste the powder on the back of my tongue so I think it worked. Can’t say l feel differently having taken it about 30 min ago. Keep in mind the vast majority of medications are made over seas. Do you think the FDA has teams living there to surprise inspect?,Brent

5,Albuterol,Bronchiectasis,10.0,,"January 31, 2019",5,"ProAir HFA (albuterol):I was diagnosed with bronchitis after one nurse said oh you just have a head cold. This went on for a week and I got worse and finally went to urgent care and the PA told me you have a bad case of bronchitis. He put me on a Zpack, prednisone, the proair inhaler and a non-narcotic cough medicine. I have finished the Zpack and prednisone but still take the cough syrup at night and use the inhaler during coughing attacks which are less frequent. I was so bad the first 3 days of Bronchitis I coughed constantly and took Robitussin around the clock every 6 hours and it did not help. I could not sleep as my coughing woke me up constantly thru the night . I work in cubicles, 4 per cubicle. One lady coughed constantly for a week and a half. 2 weeks later I was sick. The following week our 3rd cubicle mate was out for a week. We found out 2 people had pneumonia. I live in Utah where we have an inversion every winter (pollution hanging over the valley making people sick).",MamaCoughs

7,Albuterol,Bronchiectasis,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"March 8, 2018",1,ProAir RespiClick (albuterol):This product (as stated in all the other comments) is simply garbage. I had to google the product to figure out how it worked and it just doesn’t. All the medicine did was make my heart race. This product gave me no relief in any way.,Dylan
8,Albuterol,Bronchiectasis,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"May 3, 2017",0,I was given a proair respiclick the other day after being diagnosed with acute bronchitis and an upper respiratory infection. I've used proair inhalers in the past and they have always worked. I cannot suck in enough air to get the medicine out and it has not helped me at all.,proairrespiclick

10,Albuterol,Bronchiectasis,7.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"January 7, 2017",0,Taking for bronchitis. Using ProAir HFR inhaler.  Used 2 puffs x every 5 hours seemed to be helping very nicely till I tried to go to bed.  I did get a steroid shot this morning so that is working against me also but I am absolutely not sleepy and it is now 1am.    I usually am in bed by 930/10pm religiously. I am now coughing again and needing another dosing.   I took my 5 cc of codeine cough syrup at 9pm  thinking that would help be drop off to sleep but noooo.    I am going to take 1 puff of the inhaler and one 5mg Ambien.   I was sent home from work to REST and I can't.   I have to start the Medrol dose pack tomorrow and that has always affected my sleeping without throwing anything else in on top of the mixture.,nurse nadine

15,Albuterol,Bronchiectasis,9.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"November 22, 2014",9,"Ventolin HFA (albuterol):for never being on an inhaler before this works very very well. I've had a pretty bad cough for almost 2 years that was diagnosed as rhinitis and we tried nasal sprays and allergy medications this is like a breath of fresh air in my lungs. I'd recommend it, just watch for dry mouth!",Jillian51894
