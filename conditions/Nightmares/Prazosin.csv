It worked really gradually, after about a month I realized I hadn’t had a nightmare for a few weeks. They were a 4-5 day a week occurrence on good weeks since I was about 6 years old. I ran out due to an insurance issue last week and after 2 days my nightmares were back and swinging big. Last night I got back on it and I hope that tonight the nightmares are gone again.

3,Prazosin,Nightmares,10.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"January 2, 2022",1,"Prazosin has changed my life. I suffered from extremely disturbing nightmares related to trauma for most of my life. Since starting Prazosin, my nightmares have completely stopped only to be replaced by intensely real dreams. I am no longer afraid to go to sleep at night and I’m not waking through the night terrified of the nightmares I was experiencing. My dreams are so crisp and clear and sometimes weird, but not scary anymore. I’m so thankful for this medication.",Marie
4,Prazosin,Nightmares,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"November 9, 2021",2,"I would have intense nightmares/night terrors of my trauma with a little bit of my spiritual beliefs infused with them. So I would literally dream of my Sergeant as a black-eyed demon and my base as hell. I don’t know why I dream like this but I’m literally afraid of the dark. Well, anyways, At first, I was placed on prazosin in late 2019 with 1mg. (I didn’t think it could go any higher at the time) it worked at first until I had my first nightmare of the devil… when it didn’t stop that. I grew hopeless and ultimately thought the medication didn’t work. Now, late 2021, I’m back on it at 1mg. I think it’s important to note that I’ve been in therapy and doing really well— and it works! I sleep so good at night. Best sleep I ever had. I thank everybody involved. I thank my Angels for fighting these demons. I think my strength to keep going on and giving it another chance.",Jus

After taking psychiatric medications for the other issues for years, but still having regular full-blown night terrors, I happened to tell a new psychiatrist about the nightmares (my insurance changed so I had to get a new doctor). He put me on prazosin. I take 2mg every night along with my other nighttime meds. I have only had two PTSD-related night terrors since. I have been on this medication for over four years. It has literally changed my life. I have not noticed any adverse side effects. Incidentally, I have always had low blood pressure and my doctor had some concerns about that because this med is sometimes prescribed for high blood pressure. At this dosage I have had no problems with my blood pressure falling even lower. If you want to try this med for nightmares please make sure your doctor is aware of any blood pressure issues.",PTSD

I've been taking prazosin for about four years.    The way this medication affects me is this:  my usual nightmares still occur,  but instead of waking up multiple times at night with hallucinations,  I experience the entire dream/nightmare,  but in a more mellow version.    However,  during my waking hours during the next day I am constantly looking around for the characters in the bad parts of my nightmares as though they're trying to catch me in real time.    So,  I sleep all night,  but pay the price for the full night sleep the next day.    I give prazosin a three on the one-to-ten scale.",B.J.

My nightmares and night terrors were such that I felt it was better to just stay awake all the time, and this was relatively easy anyway since I also suffer from Bipolar I Disorder, the type where two hours of sleep is sufficient. Needless to say, sleep deprivation was destroying me slowly. A psychiatrist prescribed Prazosin. At first, I was skeptical - how can a pill make my nightmares stop? It sure it! I have to take it, 4mg, every night, though, otherwise I'd be guaranteed to have nightmares.

This makes me super happy since my dreams are usually very vivid and long and they stick with me for the entire day.

No dreams noticed (good or bad) since upping to 3 mg, I now sleep through the night and most importantly no more waking up screaming and fighting.

I do feel better throughout the day but have fainted twice from the drug lowering my blood pressure.  I’m also taking ten mg of Lisiniprol each evening.  The fainting experiences were frightening as I hit my head and awoke with blood coming from my right eye area. Left a scar.  I could not move but lay shaking sweating sick to my stomach.  Second episode I fainted but I knew I was going to so I tried to sit down on my couch.  I did faint but what woke me was I was vomiting profusely.  That scared me as I could have died from my own vomit had I been flat on the floor.  I’m weaning myself off of it as this drug is too much for me.  It is very powerful.  Granted we are individuals who have different reactions.  It’s great that it works for some but I’ll take the nightmares over the drug as I am very frightened of it.  Just not for everyone.,Laci

I've had terrible nightmares every night since I was a teenager, and have been taking antidepressants for them for a decade, to little effect. Prazosin has given me the ability to wake up without shakiness, terrible memories of my dreams, and nausea for the first time in decades. I am endlessly grateful.",Addy88

I wasn’t having nightmares per se, but my dreams constantly woke me, and I was exhausted the next day. It really seems to help.

When I first started taking Prazosin It helped me a lot, but like another poster stated it did bring things out that had been pushed Deep into my mind that I had been suppressing for years and didn't know it.I'm glad I take it and will continue taking it. I started 1 - 2 caps bedtime.Then I was just upped to 3/ 1mg.

But the first night I don't remember anything... Not even sleeping so awoke felling tired and confused... But like any drug addict trying to change I am willing to do anything.. Now the therapy is making me relive so many things I kept hidden by drugs.. And as I relive more I worry and think about things more and more it isn't good and I am trying  so that I can live again.,mydaysruntogether

63,Prazosin,Nightmares,10.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"August 28, 2016",30,"It's been 6 mos now and still works miracles for my PTSD night terrors!  The combination I've found that works for me: read the Bible or listen to it from an app as you fall asleep, take 2 mgs of Prazosin, and a combination of anti-depressant (Prozac/fluoxetine) works best for me, along with an anti-anxiety med treatment for the day.My next step will be therapy when I'm ready to talk.  Until then, this combination helps tremendously.  Even with the other meds I would wake up soaking wet and fighting for my life in my night terrors. Prazosin somehow helps tremendously and was my missing link.",SouthernSummer

66,Prazosin,Nightmares,10.0,,"May 24, 2016",45,I started this as a suggestion from my pharmacist since my psych NP was not finding ANYTHING to work for my childhood nightmares. Thank God for that angel pharmacist and Thank God for this medication. Not one nightmare to feel weird about the whole next day and ruin my day! I have taken now for about a month. Yesterday I tested it out and skipped a dose to see what would happen and sure enough a nightmare. I hope they never stop making this medication. I have had zero side effects!  I am so thrilled with this medicine and not sure why I had never heard of it before or why out of all of the doctors I have seen they have not suggested it? I am only on  1 mg which is what the lowest dose? It WORKS! Save yourself the trauma and try it :),Tatsi

Nightmares stopped the first day I took it but, I experienced severe headaches, dizziness, drowsiness, nausea and a lack of energy. As I got used to it, the symptoms gradually improved but did not go away completely. If I've been drinking, the symptoms will worsen but it is bearable. Overall, my nightmares have become rare and I can sleep through the night; the side effects are worth it.",Mila K

Dr let me know it sounded like PTSD and suggested I try prozosin in addition to my normal medications. I started off on the lowest end of the dosage and after a couple weeks it was working well. Every few weeks I found the nightmare would come back and I did have to up the dose. That would stop it for another few weeks or more and when it happened again I'd up it again and now I take the max dose (I think it's 10). It's improved my sleep since I'm not waking up from this panic dream every hour. Cannot recommend enough for traumatic nightmares. Do have one side-effect- if I smoke a cigarette in the morning it almost always makes me puke. Why?",sleeplesinseattle
