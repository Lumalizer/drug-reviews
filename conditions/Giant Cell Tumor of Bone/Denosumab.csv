1,Denosumab,Giant Cell Tumor of Bone,5,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"June 9, 2019",2,Hi. I was on denosumab for 18 months due to a benign spinal tumour. The doctors stopped the drug and operated on my spine as the drug caused a thigh fracture and pain in my legs. 5 years on and 2 operations to have metal rods inserted into my femurs I am still in constant pain with my legs. Everyone's side effects are different but mine are life changing.Â ,Sunshine99
