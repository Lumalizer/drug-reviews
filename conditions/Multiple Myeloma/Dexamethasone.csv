0,Dexamethasone,Multiple Myeloma,5,,"January 24, 2022",0,"Initially was taking ten 4mg once a week. Also on Revlimid & a chemo shot once a wk. Could hardly stand & walk. Finally told Dr l was ready to quit it all & just let it take its course at which point he told me to stop the Dexamethasone. Felt better within 24 hours. Six weeks later he put me back on 3, 4mg, once a week. Day 4 each week l start feeling almost good again, but the weakness & fatigue resumes the day l take it. Also overall feeling of just feeling bad. Don't know how much longer l'm willing to do this. Medically, it's working, but wonder each time if it's really worth it.",Helen
1,Dexamethasone,Multiple Myeloma,4,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"May 2, 2020",7,"I started to take this med in April as part of my Chemo treatment. I was told that it would give me a lot of energy. I have been very active before taking this med. Now I am always tired, my voice goes and comes and have insomnia. I need to rest constantly while I do my house chores. My husband says I am not the same. I will speak to my oncologist on my next visit. Just be careful and consult with your doctor. This med has many uses. I am taking it to kill cancer cells together with Revlimid, a cancer med.",Maira
