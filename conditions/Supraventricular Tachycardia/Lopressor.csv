0,Lopressor,Supraventricular Tachycardia,10,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"February 14, 2022",2,"I recently began taking metoprolol about 2 months ago for an elevated resting heart rate (90-110 avg) and Iâ€™m VERY pleased & relieved with the results. Worked almost immediately with the lowest dose available. Now my resting hr is between 60-75. Now, my dr did have me try it singularly to treat my elevated hr & high bp, but it was ineffective on my bp. So, he put me on low dose of lisinopril as well and my bp went from 150-110 on avg, to 115/65 avg. I highly recommend Metoprolol for treatment of tachycardia (high heart rate).",Dustin
