0,Amiodarone,Supraventricular Tachycardia,1,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"February 23, 2022",0,"I started having heart palpitations at age 64. My cardiologist immediately prescribed Amiodarone. He told me not to Goggle it & look at the side effects. That certainly triggered my curiosity. The medication did help with the SVT, but after taking it for only 8 months, I have an elevated thyroid. My primary doctor is monitoring me. When I turned 65 the cardiologist immediately put me on Xarelto due to stroke risk with age and SVT. I have been in the hospital 3 times with severe nosebleeds and now very anemic. I went to a new cardiologist. He said he would never use that medication for SVT for a 65 year old, maybe a 95 year old but not my age. He said it has too many side effects. On top of this medication making my thyroid high, I now have pulmonary toxicity. 3 chest x-rays show damage to lower lungs, but it isn’t a huge area.I could kick myself for continuing to use both meds after all the side effects and damage that’s been done.Run & get another opinion!",Charlotte
1,Amiodarone,Supraventricular Tachycardia,10,,"December 16, 2021",1,"I am 81 yrs old with multiple other problems who tried in last 2 years all beta blocker and calcium channel blocker for episodes of supraventricular tachycardia with some PVC, duration between 10 min. till 2-3 hr. I refused atrial ablation because of many contraindication. Arrhythmia doctor reluctantly accepted to start with Amiodarone 200mg, 11 months ago, but more for his purse, than my interest. After 2 weeks , I had been improved and I reduced at 100mg. ( I was retired MD). Since 7 months, no arrhythmia, but I have problems with who has to prescribe and monitor for side effects! Cardiologist told only arrhythmia doctor can do, but at 2 appointments , he was busy, probably working in EKG lab on patients who accepted the surgical procedure during electrophysiology study.. it is a problem with doctor ruling, not medication if used in low dose, as I saw used in UK and Australia for elderly. I have to go and pay to PCP, cardiologist, arrhythmia specialist just to order blood tests, CXR!",Happygrandma
2,Amiodarone,Supraventricular Tachycardia,9,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"August 23, 2021",1,"I am taking Amiodarone 100 mg since 5 months. After 2 weeks,  my supraventricular tachycardia  previously  2-3 times/ week did disappear. No lung or liver complication, except photosensitivity and vision problem. I replaced iodized salt with Himalaya and pray God to keep me out of  salt. Though, tiredness is excessive, so probably I will discontinue .",Megan
3,Amiodarone,Supraventricular Tachycardia,8,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"March 14, 2021",3,"Started with Amiodarone 200 mg without food ,in the middle of the day, (in AM I take my HTN meds Irbesartan, Hydrochlorothiazide, plus  Metformin for frequent supraventricular tachycardia 5- 4 times/ week, regular with few PVT,  with episodes  5 minutes to 3 hours almost daily, apparently calmed down by repeated Valsalva manoever. Being 81 years old with multiple other conditions, I refused atrial ablation. I tried Diltiazem, Metoprolol, Bisoprolol alone, having also HTN. Nothing worked, got progressively tired (plus other side effects) and slowly SVT duration and frequency increased under any of above treatment until Dr at one episode under 1. Added at Bisoprolol 5 mg, Amiodarone 200 mg. After 2 weeks, I saw  HR 46-47, so I reduced to half, and my situation is improved ( 1 SVT under 15 min. /week  stopped after Valsalva.",Grandma
4,Amiodarone,Supraventricular Tachycardia,1,,"September 28, 2020",24,This drug is dangerous. My father took it after having a pacemaker/defibrillator put in   It had a toxic effect on him crystallised his lungs and  he died less than a month after taking amiodarone. Since his death I have talked to other people who had the same experience with their parents. BEWARE and look for side effects so you can stop it quickly!!!,Sad
5,Amiodarone,Supraventricular Tachycardia,8,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"December 8, 2019",31,"I have been on this drug amiodarone  for 3 years for V-tach resulting from bad wiring.  For the lung problems, I take an expectorant periodically to relief congestion.  I go to the gym three times a week and work out with weights and treadmill to combat muscle weakness and shortness of breath.  Very important to keep weight down as this will add to shortness of breath.  I use L-Arginine to help with male performance do not use Viagra...too dangerous.  The ICD has shocked me around 8 times since 2014...this drug did not help with that.  Ejection Fraction at 25%.  Recently had an endo-ablation.  Next is a epi-ablation as the doctors seek to eliminate this drug from my medication regiment.  The shocks originally occurred prior to the prescribing of this drug.  Once on 400mg/day shocks stopped.  Last year dosage was reduced to 200mg/day and shocks returned four months later.  Move to 600mg/day until ablation, now on 200mg/day since PVC's stopped.  I am 69 years old.",Ron
6,Amiodarone,Supraventricular Tachycardia,8,,"May 23, 2019",30,"I use  amiodarone as current medical treatment for WPW Syndrome. It is very convenient as a medication as I have to take only 1 or 2 amiodarone pill per day as compared to other meds like beta blockers or flecanide which needs a round the clock dose. However, the downside is all the side effects that this medication have. From elevated liver enzymes for someone who does not consume alcoholic drinks to photophobia (light sensitivity) this med may not be for everyone. I wear tinted prescription lenses of 85% density day and night as I became sensitive to lights after 2 months of the treatment.  But, I accept to live like a visually impaired person rather than constantly having tachycardia episodes that lasts for hours and having WPW attacks at night even when I sleep. Take it at your own risk bearing in mind that sometimes the therapeutic benefit it gives outweighs the side effects.",Ced9888
