0,Bisoprolol,Supraventricular Tachycardia,5.0,,"March 29, 2022",0,Been taking it for two months and it doesn’t let my heart rate get above 120 which is amazing as it used to hit 190 just standing up. However I am so extremely dizzy and faint on this medication. I get head rushes constantly and have been bedridden due to it. I’m now switching to metoprolol and hoping that will make a difference. Tried to taper off of bisoprolol and had the worst chest pains.,Anonymous
1,Bisoprolol,Supraventricular Tachycardia,7.0,Taken for 5 to 10 years,"November 29, 2021",1,After what I believe may have been a heart attack. Five major chest blows. Two months of bed rest. I went to internal medicine doctor was put on Bisoprolol 5mg and started losing fluid. I lost the 60 pounds of fluid I gained. I was finally able to urinate a decent amount  . I'm now seven years on it and I believe its losing its effect. Water weight is back but also believe getting the flu contributed to the set back. I don't know where to go from here.,Anonymous
2,Bisoprolol,Supraventricular Tachycardia,9.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"November 20, 2021",2,I have been taking  Bisoprolol 2.5mg tablets and Apixaban 2.5mg for several years with no real side effects. It has kept the sudden heartbeat levels that occurred previously under control very well.The only thing that I keep an eye on is the fact that I have a natural low pulse of around 50....so do not want the rate to drop lower. I Have been very pleased  with the treatment.,Barry812
3,Bisoprolol,Supraventricular Tachycardia,3.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"November 8, 2021",3,"I have just been diagnosed with Paroxysmal Atrial Fibrillation, after having violent palpitations. The hospital prescribed Bisoprolol 2.5. A week ago as my blood pressure was very high. I feel awful, depressed from the diagnoses,  exhausted, breathless, dry mouth, nausea and my heart is heavy in my chest. Last night my heartbeats woke me up. They also prescribed apixaban blood thinners which I have not started after reading the dangerous side effects. My GP asked me to wait a few more days to see if my body adjusts. I hope it does as feeling like this is miserable",Gaby
4,Bisoprolol,Supraventricular Tachycardia,2.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"April 11, 2021",31,"I got put on bisprolol 1.25mg after spending a night in hospital with a heart rate of 167 refusing to go down for 6-8 hours and then suffering nightly palpitations for days after which were waking me up. Placed on them whilst under investigation with tests.Whilst bisoprolol helped stopped the episodes for 4 months I didn't realise how ill they were making me. I've now been off them for 4 days with advice from my DR. I was planning to switch but do not need to ATM.Here's some of the side effects I was experiencing on the medication which have mostly gone away after stopping them, more symptoms appeared over time.Started with blurred vision, eyes became sore and swollen especially in mornings, eye twitching started in one eye, then second. Muscle twitches in hands and feet. Veins enlarging in hands. Waking up every morning feeling breathless and tightness on my chest. Brain fog. Could feel and hear my heartbeat even whilst low. Heart rate dropping below 60. Weight gain.",Dani
5,Bisoprolol,Supraventricular Tachycardia,5.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"January 6, 2021",9,"I was put on 2.5mg of bisoprolol for episodes of SVT. It mostly calmed that down, but a gradually increasing side effect was allergic rhinitis.  This started with a runny nose whilst exercising, and got steadily worse over a couple of months until I was sneezing constantly, the lining of my nose was red raw and swollen, and I had rivers of snot. It was incapacitating. I experimented with taking a double dose of the antihistamine cetirizine, which helped with the symptoms, but didn't know about the safety of taking the two combined, so rang the pharmacist, who advised me to ring the GP. After consultation, the GP has changed me onto atenolol. I haven't started it yet, but apparently bisoprolol is the only beta blocker that causes rhinitis, so am hoping it will be better than the bisoprolol.",Laura W Taylor

8,Bisoprolol,Supraventricular Tachycardia,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"April 27, 2020",35,"Previously was on amiodarone for a decade. Last month I underwent a 3D Mapping ablation and was switched on to bisoprolol 2.5mg. After a couple of days I started having issues. Higher production of mucus which led to a severe lung congestion, fatigue was also high, itching of skin which led to rashes and nausea. Never had this kind of side effects with amiodarone, metroprolol, sotalol or any other medicines.",V J

10,Bisoprolol,Supraventricular Tachycardia,,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"November 6, 2019",65,I have been taking Bisoprolol 10 mg ( one per day) for 3 years now. I was suffering Tachycardia and was fainting regularly. At 70 years of age I go jogging and go to the gym once per week. I feel super fit and my personal trainer says I am fitter than many of his customers who are 30 years younger than me.No doubt I will just drop down dead one day ( Brexit will probably still be rumbling on ! ) but in the meantime > hallelujah !,Rochma
11,Bisoprolol,Supraventricular Tachycardia,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"November 2, 2019",84,I was originally prescribed Metoprolol and was experiencing serious side effects. My doctor took me off of it and didn’t prescribe anything to replace it. For a year I continued to suffer with the heart issues and became unable to function. I went into a clinic in active Atrial fibrillation and the clinic doctor prescribed Bisoprolol 5mg once a day and now I feel on top of the world! I am wondering if anyone else has used this medication for the same condition?,Des

14,Bisoprolol,Supraventricular Tachycardia,9.0,Taken for 10 years or more,"May 23, 2019",14,"I’m 72 and have been taking Ziac for over 20 years to control blood pressure and fluid retention. Last year I had a bout of SVT and was switched to Metoprolol. I quickly developed swollen calves & ankles and felt poorly. Went back on Ziac and am back to normal. So I’m all for Bisoprolol HCTZ generic Ziac. 2,5/6.5 each morning works just fine.",Napoleon
15,Bisoprolol,Supraventricular Tachycardia,10.0,,"September 30, 2018",40,"Bisprolol 5mg has been amazing, changed my life, taking about 2-3 weeks to build up in your system. Beta blockers definitely reduce stress and how adrenaline impacts you. For example I can confidently talk in front of groups without anxiety, I also don’t have to spend as much time recovering from anxiety. I am generally more calmer overall and it’s helped me think much clearer.Beta2 blockers work by stopping adrenaline from working on the heart, which helps you feel calmer (reducing rate and contractility)So if your skeptical, like I was give it a try, I have no side effects although I do notice I don’t recover from exercise as fast. Which makes perfect sense, a small downside for various upsides.",Speed
16,Bisoprolol,Supraventricular Tachycardia,1.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"September 20, 2017",44,"After hospitalized and diagnosed that I have SVT, I've been 30 days on Bisoprolol. During those 30 days I feel tired, feeling like want to take a deep breath and release it and at night when I am about go to sleep - once I lay my body on bed - I feel a strange in my chest. It's not SVT (heartbeat race). I can not describe it, but I know the feeling is never happen before I have Bisoprolol.",odading
17,Bisoprolol,Supraventricular Tachycardia,10.0,,"January 16, 2016",25,My doctor prescribed me 5mg concor. When I started my 208-213 bpm heart rate drops to 70-100 bpm. And also said that if this wouldn't help to drop we can make  catheter ablation operation. I also test to give up the pills for 2 days then it again start to beat at 180-200 bpm.

18,Bisoprolol,Supraventricular Tachycardia,1.0,,"June 7, 2014",43,I was prescribed bisprolol fumarate 2.5mg and first 8 days no reaction then I got stomach pains then lips swelled up then felt throat restriction. I went to my doctor and asked if I could use lesser dose he said no I was allergic to it and it took that long for it to show. Now three weeks later I am just feeling it is going out of my system I have had lots of heart booms and feeling really off very frightening I would never take them again my heart was feeling really strange. I have phoned the consultant who prescribed them but to date no reply although I left message. I have never had these feelings before the tablets and the heart going every now and again like a deep beat was quite alarming seems to be quietening down now.,j shepherd
