0,Metoprolol,Supraventricular Tachycardia,10.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"February 22, 2022",0,I have high blood pressure - I started experiencing tachycardia- went to emergency room. I was prescribed metoprolol about one year ago. I take one 25 MG per day at bedtime. Best thing ever. Very restful sleep also. No noticeable side-effects.,B. Fletcher
1,Metoprolol,Supraventricular Tachycardia,10.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"February 14, 2022",2,"Metoprolol Succinate ER (metoprolol):I have always had an elevated resting heart rate my entire life, but over the years, it has slowly risen from around 80 bpm, to 100 bpm on avg. So, my dr prescribed metoprolol ER succinate 50mg tabs/once daily about 2 months ago. I almost immediately (within a day or two) started to see positive results in my resting hr (went from averaging 100 bpm to 65 bpm). That uneasy and twitchy feeling I got when my heart rate would rise was gone. I feel much more relaxed and calm now and I actually look forward to going to bed, which was something I dreaded every night because I would lay for hours extremely restless with nothing but the sound/feel of my heart beating out of my chest. Although, the metoprolol was ineffective for me in treating my high bp (was put on lisinopril-works great). As for treating my tachycardia, I highly recommend those who suffer from a high resting hr to consult your dr about metoprolol! Game changer for me!",Dustin
2,Metoprolol,Supraventricular Tachycardia,10.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"February 14, 2022",2,"Lopressor (metoprolol):I recently began taking metoprolol about 2 months ago for an elevated resting heart rate (90-110 avg) and I’m VERY pleased & relieved with the results. Worked almost immediately with the lowest dose available. Now my resting hr is between 60-75. Now, my dr did have me try it singularly to treat my elevated hr & high bp, but it was ineffective on my bp. So, he put me on low dose of lisinopril as well and my bp went from 150-110 on avg, to 115/65 avg. I highly recommend Metoprolol for treatment of tachycardia (high heart rate).",Dustin

The brain fog is HORRIBLE, I can’t think straight, and thankfully I work from home or I’d be screwed. I can’t process things, it feels like my brain is just gone. But hey, at least my heart rate is down? This also gives me terrible dizziness about an hour after taking it, I feel like I’m spinning and losing balance. I had a very weird episode of palpitations last night as well, like rolling electric shocks in my chest.

Started out with 25mg daily.  I developed palpitations a couple years ago, heart monitor showed SVTs and PACs.  Because the palpitations continued Dr. upped the dosage to 50 mg per day which did wonders, no more palpitations.  Then back in Sept. 2021 I took Sudafed for sinus congestion that wouldn't clear up.  That started a cascade of events with palpitations happening every 10-15 minutes all day long.  Super scary!  Doctor increased the dose to 100 mg daily which knocked down the palpitations to 1-2 per day some days and none on other days.  This drug has been great for me. No side effects other than a slower HR as seen on the EKG.  Still waiting on results from the latest cardiac wearable monitor from when the palpitations were virtually non-stop.",Lori

A couple years ago I had a 24 hr stay to evaluate HR of 165. All testing normal. No treatment. A year later back in ER with pulse of 250. I was given Adenosine to convert me and then given Metoprolol Succinate 25mg daily. I've been on it a year. I noticed some tiredness but nothing major. Over the next year my tiredness became debilitating and I suffered severe depression, insomnia, and panic attacks. I didn't make the connection and blamed it on the pandemic and all the isolation and restrictions everywhere. I thought I was just having a hard time coming. Then the drenching night and day sweats started.  Still I blamed it on perimenopause. But then came the heat and activity intolerance. Minimal activity caused me to become SOB , shake, and drenched in sweat. Sleep was non existent. I began having numbness in legs and feet.",Bshawmom

I was taking 25mg twice daily of the extended release kind. I am 6’0 145lbs. My doctor is letting me try getting off the medicine. So far I have felt like a new person and finally feel happy and not as out of it and mentally absent.  I took 1/2 the pill instead for each dose and then switched to 1/2 at bedtime. Soon I will try not taking it at all. So far so good. This medicine made me almost suicidal and extremely uncomfortable in my own mind, body, and life. I hope things will go continue to go well being off the medicine.

Started taking 25mg metoprolol twice daily, but no relief from muscle fatigue and shortness of breath.  I've just started on 50mg 2X, which I'm apprehensive about because the drug does tend to cause sleepiness and lethargy in some people. Interestingly, Valsalva maneuvers have little effect on my SVT.  When I had atrial flutter, carotid message stopped it straightaway.  The only thing that seems to help with SVT is splashing cold water on my face or doing yoga breathing (inhale, hold, and slowly exhale while counting to 10).

20,Metoprolol,Supraventricular Tachycardia,9.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"January 28, 2021",5,metoprolol worked well for me I guess my problem was adrenaline causing my SVT it would happen when I was sleep deprived and having a panic attacks usually verapamil didn’t help as much but I think this drug cured the issue for me only side effects I have noticed is feeling more lazy but you can live with it. For reference I have had 4 bad SVT attacks and I get panic attacks almost everyday but been taking it for a few weeks and if it was gonna happen there is a few times it would have happened before. I recommend this treatment also other negatives says your not supposed to take Benadryl while on this medicine cause it may lower your blood pressure and I rely on that to sleep but every solution breeds a new problem,A

I am now 44.  I have been on metoprolol 25 mg, once a day in the morning, for the past 18 months and I love it. I was originally put on it twice a day, but I already had bradycardia and low blood pressure at night so within a couple of days the nighttime dose was making me wake up gasping for air with an extremely low heart rate and blood pressure so low it wouldn't register on my home monitor.  I called the doctor and he said to not take the bedtime dose. I haven't had any side effects that I recall. On the contrary, I can now play sports with my kids without flipping into an irregular rhythm.",Anonymous

I was still experiencing a higher than normal heart rate (lower after ablation, but on the high side) and a high diastolic blood pressure. Metoprolol seemed to lower both numbers initially.  I was extremely fatigued and I started noticing weight gain.  That weight gain has been is now 18 pounds in the 5 months following the ablation. Now, none of my clothes fit. I have told my doctor about the weight gain, but he did not seem concerned. I am concerned. Has anyone else had this and were you able to do something about it?  Now, the heart rate is starting to increase again. ",Jteem

101,Metoprolol,Supraventricular Tachycardia,3.0,,"November 5, 2009",14,I was put on metoprolol 50mg after my heart started to race every time I would move or do anything. The 50mg helped some but didn't keep it all the way down so then they tried me on 100mg which did the trick while I was moving but then when I wasn't it was dropping between 30-40beats so then they tried just 25mg 4 times a day and I was still having problems. It made me tired. I don't know if part of the problem is the doctors I have been seeing don't know what exactly is wrong with my heart and why it does this. Just yesterday I went to the ER after being in the hospital for a week and the doctor gave me propranolol 10mg 3 times a day which is helping. ,bearss27

Halving the dose has not changed this; I am hoping to be off it, or at least on an even lower dose, after my next cardiology appointment in June.  I think it is making me forgetful. That has definitely been a problem since taking it, although I was a bit of an absent-minded professor before. It may also have helped lower my blood pressure, although I have made some diet and lifestyle changes that would affect that, also.",brother martin

Hard to lose weight, and depression creeps up often. Brain fog has slowed my ability to focus and react swiftly, which is frustrating.
