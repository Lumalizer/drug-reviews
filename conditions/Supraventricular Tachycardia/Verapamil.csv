5,Verapamil,Supraventricular Tachycardia,9.0,,"January 28, 2018",6,"I had a problem with SVTs for a number of years and when it was necessary to have medical intervention in the ER, Verapamil was the drug of choice at that time. It always worked just fine for me with no side effects. I see now the drug of choice is Adenosine which Is very scary to watch when it is being administered to a patient. I eventually had an ablation done, but I would NOT want to have adenosine given to me if I ever was in a situation where I needed that intervention.",Poopyfart

8,Verapamil,Supraventricular Tachycardia,10.0,,"December 18, 2010",27,Calan SR (verapamil):I have been taking CALAN SR 120 for over 10 years now.  My episodes of SVT occur at most a couple of times a year and then for short duration.  My pharmacy issued me a generic once because CALAN was not available and I had SVTs almost daily.  I was very glad when CALAN became available again.  I would not like to be without it.,Anonymous
9,Verapamil,Supraventricular Tachycardia,7.0,,"February 26, 2009",36,"Calan SR (verapamil):I used Verapamil for 5 years to treat supraventricular tachycardia (SVT). With each visit to the doctor, they increased my dosage. I started out taking 30mg once a day, and ended with 180mg once a day.  For the most part, my symptoms were never controlled. The drug caused extreme fatigue and tiredness. I often had severe headaches and was constipated.  I have been switched to Atenolol 50mg once a day now. Hopefully I won't have as many unwanted side effects.",Anonymous
