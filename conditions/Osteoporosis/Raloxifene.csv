0,Raloxifene,Osteoporosis,1,Taken for less than 1 month,"March 18, 2022",0,"My doctor nagged me into taking this for osteoporosis. After two weeks on this, I had a constant runny nose/sneezing/coughing, and constant GERD.  Medications would not relieve either of these conditions. I didn't realize they were related to the medication, and was getting ready to make an appointment with a gastro doc, and thought to check and see if the heartburn might be caused by the osteoporosis drug. Sure enough, it is one of the side effects, so is sinusitis and coughing. I can't go through my life like this, blowing my nose constantly and feeling like my insides are burning up. I stopped the drug, and the symptoms disappeared within 48 hours. I messaged the doctor and let her know about it. All she had to say was ""sorry that happened, I'm glad you're feeling better.""  I'll be relying on Vitamin D, Calcium and boron to keep my bones strong from here on out.",Bets

I am not looking forward to shots so will have to try different medication and not looking forward to possible side effects, but no longer at 72 yrs old can I take evista according to my doctor due to the effect it could now have to my female organs from what the Dr said",linda

3,Raloxifene,Osteoporosis,1,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"March 9, 2021",16,"Evista (raloxifene):Took Evista for slightly more than 1 year. Tolerated it well with no side effects. Developed a vaginal polyp while on this med. Was taking this medication for osteoporosis, however... there was NO improvement in my bone density at all. Nothing.For those of you at cancer risk taking this drug, beware! Look it up on the internet and you'll find an article stating: ""A US judge has ruled that Eli Lilly has been unlawfully promoting its osteoporosis treatment Evista (raloxifene) by claiming that it has been demonstrated to reduce the risk of breast cancer, and has ordered the company to stop making any further promotional claims of that nature.

This is FALSE information. Search the internet for: Evista False Claims. You'll find that the manufacturer of Evista  was ordered to stop these false claims. A US judge has ruled that Eli Lilly has been unlawfully promoting its osteoporosis treatment Evista (raloxifene)... Lilly's sales representatives had falsely told doctors that Evista could prevent breast cancer."" Sad but true!",Pinkie
5,Raloxifene,Osteoporosis,1,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"February 9, 2021",7,"Patient beware. The promises that this drug will improve osteoporosis and prevent fractures are false. Raloxifene did nothing for my osteoporosis. Others say the same. Read the reviews. Many have had no improvement at all, and many have had bone loss while on this drug.

After 12 months on the drug I took a new bone density that showed a mild improvement of 1.8 percent. However, when my doctor took another density test farther up my spine away from lumbar region the results were not good. He believes the bone density reading to be false. He wants me to change to Prolia .. but because of the toxicity and hair loss.. I’m too afraid with my compromised immune system and CFID’s disease.",Dee
