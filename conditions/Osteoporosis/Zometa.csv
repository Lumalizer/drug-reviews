0,Zometa,Osteoporosis,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"January 29, 2022",1,"I am 65 and consider myself strong and overall healthy.  I will never have this infusion again.  My side effects included vomiting, diarrhea, fever, severe neck pain, joint pain including thumbs and knees and my nose hurt.   On my oncologist's suggestion, I had a covid test and it came back negative for covid or the flu.   Now after 17 days, I am still experiencing flu like symptoms, late day fatigue and just an overall blah feeling.  I had a breast cancer lumpectomy in August and 4 weeks of radiation. I do not see any benefit of this drug and will try something else to get the calcium in my bones as the side effects are absolutely horrible.",dchamb74

They gave it me for 1 year. Meanwhile my bones were becoming weaker and weaker every day.  My jaw become painful and was almost impossible to talk, to eat and chew.My bones started to have fractures without any particular accident. Doctors gave me Zometa for 6 years. After 1year, the Zometa caused me bone cancer.If Zometa is good for bones, then why after 1year of infusions I've had bone cancer ?",Maestramaria

5,Zometa,Osteoporosis,2.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"June 6, 2019",59,"For four weeks I had little to no appetite, and periods of tiredness. For the first 3 weeks I also was in a stupor, tired and weak every day, with nausea daily.

W would never, never take Zometa again and I do NOT recommend it. ",jake
6,Zometa,Osteoporosis,4.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"April 19, 2019",18,"I have been given this drug during and after chemo.  I can not find anywhere in literature of how long it stays in the jaw bones after you stop take this drug.  7 yrs later I still find that tho I am cancer free, it ruined my teeth.  Some Doctors say it lasts the rest of your life.  There has got to be a half life, but no one answers the question. (half life = 146 hours, time for clearance = over 30 days)",t
7,Zometa,Osteoporosis,8.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"September 28, 2017",16,"I received Zometa IV on 9/26/17, after being informed of all the possible side effects. Although I was somewhat concerned, I was pleasantly surprised when 2 days later I have experienced nothing worse that a little more joint pain than usual when line dancing last evening.  Hopefully, this medication will improve my bone density, or at least keep it stable.",Elena's gram
8,Zometa,Osteoporosis,3.0,,"September 3, 2017",26,"Had 1 t-7 fracture due to the Osteoporosis. Recently had the reclast infusion and it is awful. Flu like symptoms no way, much much worse. I literally was incapacitated. The pain everywhere in my bones, joints, hips even my fingers. I feel my doctors were not honest with me on how I would or could really feel. On the positive though I hope in one year my bone density and bone mass will have improved. I don't want another fracture.",Debbiemit1962
