0,Boniva,Osteoporosis,8.0,,"March 18, 2022",0,"I started Boniva 3 months ago when diagnosed with osteoporosis. Before taking it, although quite active, I had a constant dull, nagging pain in both hips. That pain has stopped. I feel great but am really watching for side effects.  My only symptom has been that my sight has become a little blurry. If I get some of the symptoms others complain about I will stop.  I am considering taking the pill every other month instead of every month.  I have begun walking more and also am now eating plant based estrogen in ground flax seeds (I put it in my cereal) and true yams (not those orange sweet potato type) to help my body heal itself.  Some say the loss of estrogen is what contributes to bone loss, so after studying this, figured I'd give it a try!   I wish good health to you all.",Healthy in FL

2,Boniva,Osteoporosis,10.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"February 22, 2022",0,"I was diagnosed with lower spinal and left hip Osteoporosis and was prescribed Boniva which I've been taking for over a year now. I've always done as prescription directions say, I don't drink anything for an hour after taking, I don't lay back down after taking and I've had no side affects. I also take liquid Ultra-D 5000 supplement (emulsified Vitamin D w/cod liver oil) twice a day, as well as Calcium and Magnesium 225mg/75mg (2 twice a day) from Vital Nutrients. I just had my second DEXA scan and the doctor was happy to tell me that my bone density has greatly improved. It may be the vitamins, but I'll continue to take Boniva with the vitamins and look forward to continued improvement.",Janet
3,Boniva,Osteoporosis,1.0,,"January 9, 2022",0,"After diagnosis of osteoporosis at 2.9 in my lower spine, I took ONE 150mg Boniva pill on August 1 2021.  The next day I started having lower back pain while sitting at my desk. The pain continued to get worse, and left me unable to get up from my desk or bend over without severe pain. Pain relievers did not help much, patches at night helped some, heating pad at my desk helped some but I had a bad month of pain. I also experienced numbness in my feet and toes and teeth sensitivity for the first time. After 5 months of being off of Boniva, the lower back pain and teeth sensitivity is almost all gone. There is still some numbness in my feet but I am taking alpha lapoic and that is much better also. I am not currently taking anything for the osteoporosis or for pain, and trying to control with improved diet, exercise, and calcium, D3, and K2 supplements. Doctors said my back pain was not from Boniva. I say doctors should only prescribe for severe osteo, due to the potential bad side effects.",Boniva One Pill
4,Boniva,Osteoporosis,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"October 1, 2021",1,"My osteopenia worsened to osteoporosis after taking Tamoxifen for my Breast CA { HX of Breast CA since 2008} I was prescribed by my MD to take Boniva due to my B/L hip osteoporosis since last year. It's only this month that I had the courage to take it. I took it last Sunday  at 6AM and after dinner on same day, I felt terribly sick: flu=like symptoms with low-grade fever that started at 8 pm. I thought I got the COVID. Monday came and the chills are gone but I still had 100.6 fever and body aches plus GI upset. My abdominal pain was terrible like sharp pain(terrible spasms that come and go every 10 minutes) either when I  was at rest or moving. Today is the 4th day but no improvement with my GI symptoms. Additional SE today is bloated stomach now.  I reached out for the help of my GI doctor and he prescribed me an anti=spasmodic tablet which has helped a little  bit. True enough after reading all these comments that BONIVA is awful to the body. One dose is enough for me.",Leah
5,Boniva,Osteoporosis,1.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"September 23, 2021",1,I took this last Friday and had no side effects!

6,Boniva,Osteoporosis,1.0,,"September 12, 2021",0,"I’m a 70 year old woman in pretty good health. GP put me on Boniva due to Osteoporosis. I’ve taken it once a month for the last five months.  I have been to both my GP and to urgent care in the last month because I have ear aches, swollen glands, a stiff neck and a terrible sore throat. Both GP an urgent care doctor could find nothing wrong with my throat. I honestly felt like an antibiotic would snap me out of this but they prescribed nothing. Today I was rummaging around in the bathroom closet and came upon the six page data sheet that came with my Boniva. I happened to glance at it and I realized that the first dangerous symptom was esophageal pain and throat- neck issues. HELLO!  I do have an appointment next week with an ENT just to make sure nothing is cooking in there (because my daughter did have thyroid cancer when she was 30.)  It made me worried but I realized today it may be the Boniva giving me the side effects. Don’t plan to take any more until I see ENT.",PattyJ

The first month I just had a tummy ache for the first hour or so and a headache. then the next month, I got a headache and feelings of unease. third time it affected my eyes like a cloud was coming over me and made my eyes blurry, increased my anxiety. Also my heart rate increased and so did my blood pressure. The fourth and final month everything just got worse. Severe anxiety, shaky, heart rate, BP, headache, blurry eyes... it is taking a very long time to get it out of my body. I have lost weight. I'm praying I will be healed.

9,Boniva,Osteoporosis,1.0,,"May 25, 2021",15,"I have taken Ibandronate (Boniva) for 4 months. The first month I did pretty well. The second month started showing some side effects, upset stomach, loss of appetite.  The 3 rd month I got a terrible headache within 45 minutes of taking it. Then it seems like a cloud was coming over. I looked outside but there was no clouds. The headache and vision problems lasted over two weeks. Also I was dizzy. The fourth month (and FINAL) I feel so horrible. Along with all the other side effects  now my heart rate has increased, my blood pressure is elevated, nervousy feeling inside like I'm shaking, I feel like I've been poisoned. I went to my eye Dr just to have him check my eyes because I have glaucoma. He said my eyes look fine but I still have the headache and vision issues.

14,Boniva,Osteoporosis,2.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"March 7, 2020",62,"Started Boniva 150mg monthly after having a DEXA with t-score of -3.5The first month I had some slight side effects sleepiness, aches and diarrhea on the second and third day, after that I felt okay, except maybe some shortness of breath but nothing too alarming. I did notice one positive though, my back pain that I would get while lying flat, had gone away. So, I decided to keep taking it. When I took the second dose, I had side effects starting again about the second day. I had slight chest pain on and off. About the second week we went out shopping and I wanted to go home, because of a terrible cramping in my right ankle. What made me call the doctor and tell her I’m not going to continue boniva was the constant light headache and lightheaded feeling I had everyday. Constantly.I started feeling like myself again a few days before the 3rd dose was supposed to be. I really wish there wasn’t all these side effects and worries with it. Im going to try something else on my own.",ChihuahuaMom
15,Boniva,Osteoporosis,4.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"February 25, 2020",36,"Took first month's dose on Boniva without any issues but this morning took 2nd dose. Set the timer and waited the hour before drinking another 30 minutes before eating. About 3-4 hours later, left work for vomiting and dizziness.  Barely made it home and became very sick.  Had taken a multi vitamin after breakfast and well after the alotted wait time for Boniva. Reading about side effects says ""vomiting"" is due to an overdose.  Haven't heard back from physician (probably won't) but will be reconsidering taking the 3rd dose.  Prior to Boniva, I took Prolia injection without any major side effects but was extremely expensive even with insurance so changed to Boniva.  But now Boniva scares me and certainly has some serious side effects.",Margie
16,Boniva,Osteoporosis,3.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"February 15, 2020",36,"I started Boniva once a month dosage five months ago for osteopenia and early osteoporosis. Every month it seems I feel a little worse. I'm experiencing daily heartburn, reflux, nausea, leg cramps, and headaches (which I rarely have).  I usually have a lot of energy and I'm not a napper.  But over the last few months I find my self falling asleep watching TV and feeling tired after a full night's sleep.  I was beginning to think there might be something serious going on, but since reading the other posts, I'm inclined to think it may be the Boniva causing the problem. I asked my pharmacist and he said whatever side effects I'm experiencing should wear off 2-3 days after my monthly dosage...no so. I'm not loosing weight and have an appetite. Do I just put up with the side effects and hope for the best?",Yoga Lover
17,Boniva,Osteoporosis,1.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"January 27, 2020",22,"This is the worse pill I ever took. I followed directions and after taking the pill for awhile, I would wake up in the middle of the night and start vomiting. At first I thought I was getting a cold. Got up in the morning and felt fine until I started to eat. I thought I was having a heart attack. I went to see my doctor and it turns out it was Boniva that was causing it and the reason my food wasn’t going down was cause thickening of the throat. I had to get my throat stretched 5 times and now have acid reflux. I have to take 3 anti acid pills a day now. Shame they produce such dangerous meds",Blondie

24,Boniva,Osteoporosis,2.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"November 19, 2019",24,"My side effects from Boniva caused me pain, money,  and aggravation.  Two days into the first month, I had severe face, ear, and neck pain. This lasted for 5 days! The second month, I experienced the same face, ear, and neck pain, accompanied  by toothache on both sides of by upper and lower back teeth.  I awoke two nights grinding my teeth to the point that one tooth broke off.  I did not take Boniva for the 3rd  month; however, several days into the month, I noticed that one of my back teeth that I had experienced pain during the two months of Boniva treatment, had loosened and raised from the gum. When I finally got a dentist  appointment,  I had to have one tooth extracted  and am due for a 2nds extraction. I will never take Boniva again.

25,Boniva,Osteoporosis,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"November 4, 2019",42,"I took this medication Boniva as prescribed, beginning the dosage 5 days ago. As of the 2nd day, I felt as if my entire body had been poisoned. I was incredibly weak, dizzy, and hurt almost everywhere in my system. Apparently this is a combination of some of the side effects of the medication, but it was on a far larger scale than I could have expected. 5 days out, I am still mostly bearing all the same affects. My understanding is that this will take 13 days to level out, and perhaps the symptoms will be reduced. I will never take another one of this medication. My bones hurt throughout my entire body.

Honestly I was very nervous considering what I went through the first time, but I had no problems.

I only had to take Motrin twice all month and my back fractures haven't bothered me nearly as  much.

43,Boniva,Osteoporosis,3.0,,"February 2, 2018",32,"I started my first pill last Friday morning. All day Friday I felt good. Saturday morning I woke up with severe sternum pain and pain around my lower ribs. I hurt so bad I called the clinic. They said it was one of the side effects and just alternate between tylenol and motrin for the rest of the day. My hips hurt, my knee hurt, and from 9 am to 1 pm (4 hours) I had horrible chills and my hands felt ice cold. By nighttime my arm bones hurt. Sunday my lower back started to hurt.  Motrin again. Monday arms ached all day. Tuesday felt better. I never had the diarrhea. I'm surprised how many women said the same thing about the horrible sternum pain.

See you get good bone around the dead brittle bone......yes you guessed it when you have your scan the density includes this.  Thats why on the leaflet it still warns of brittle bones.I have stopped taking it.I also got pains and all my joints started clicking.....is that normal?","Deb, 56 have osteoporosis."

Have had a few side affects with the drug but nothing that has been troublesome to the extent that I wanted to discontinue the therapy. My rheumatologist now wants me to discontinue Boniva and try a different drug. Needless to say, I was disappointed in having spent five years taking a drug that was not beneficial.

47,Boniva,Osteoporosis,10.0,Taken for 10 years or more,"August 17, 2016",100,I have osteopena and I have taken fosamax and then boniva for  about 28 years and have had no side effects at all and my osteopena as shown in bone scans has not gotten worse. I am very active and have no pains and very good health. I am now 90 years old and recently fell and broke my wrist and fractured my pelvis because I stumbled over a curb.Both fractures healed within several months and I am back to being completely normal not having to use any devices for walking and I continue to travel all over the world. I give a lot of credit to both fosamax and boniva and would like for others to know about my experience as I believe these drugs  are responsible for my good health.,Cruising Princess
48,Boniva,Osteoporosis,1.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"December 4, 2015",87,I had been on Boniva for 18 months and woke one night with severe chest pain and pain in my throat and jaw.  For the next three months I ran high fevers and suffered chills and incredible pain.    My internist denied that it could be this drug and didn't even tell me to stop taking it.  I have spent thousands of dollars on tests and nothing has indicated that it could be anything else but the drug.  The only way I have been able to function has been by taking Prednisone and tons of Advil.  Be very careful if you take this drug and if you get any of these symptoms STOP TAKING IT regardless of what your doctor says.,bsdfrmd

51,Boniva,Osteoporosis,8.0,,"May 30, 2015",102,"This is the second round of taking Boniva tablets.  I had significant improvement, such that I could quit taking it after 8 months.  Two years later, my bone density results indicated that I was again starting to lose bone density so am on boniva again.  I responded well and quickly, but I think I quit taking it too soon.  I am taking the once monthly tablet and the first three months, each time, I had really bad muscle pain in my back for two days after taking the pill, but since I knew that was one of the possible side effects, I weighed the benefits against the muscle pain and chose to continue taking it.  I have been on Boniva this round for nine months now, and I no longer have the muscle pain or any other side effects.",chelabailey
