0,Fosamax,Osteoporosis,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"March 15, 2022",0,"I was asymptomatic but deemed high risk for fracture since diagnosed with osteoporosis.I respect some who’ve  actually benefited from Fosamax. However, this has been a drug nightmare with symptoms similar to others here on this site. First week taking weekly Fosamax 70 followed next day by non stop diarrhea for remainder of week. Second week dose 2 had ongoing diarrhea,  chills, nausea, fatigue and debilitating cramps as if punched repeatedly in stomach. To my FP’s irritation, strongly refused further treatment after 2 weeks stopping prior to 3rd dose. Also declined Prolia injectable as alternative as it must be followed by oral bio phosphates after injections discontinued. I’m still dealing with diarrhea and fatigue impacting quality of life.Please do extensive reading on side effects before pursuing Fosamax or other bone health drugs. I’m now pursuing a more natural option through exercise, nutrition, vitamins D3, calcium, K2 and fish oil.",Boodles67
1,Fosamax,Osteoporosis,1.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"February 18, 2022",0,"I reluctantly started taking Alendronate on November 6, 2021.  In addition, I had a knee injury and had begun physical therapy a few days earlier. My knee hurt when I kneeled or squatted, but I could walk without pain. I did not notice any issues for the first 3 weeks, but had started limping.  I attributed the limp to the physical therapy and focusing on the injury, rather than the Alendronate. The pain got worse, and I spent a lot of time elevating the knee and wrapping it in ice.  Meanwhile I finally had an MRI that verified tears in the Meniscus. By week 7 I purchased a cane to help me walk.  It hurt to roll over in bed.  My hips hurt, my leg hurt, everything hurt.  I took the 8th dose on Christmas Day.  I had suspected the pain might have more to do with the medication than the injury. I went on line and read how others had similar reactions.  I decided to stop.  Within 2 weeks the pain in my hips was gone, and by the end of January I was no longer limping.",Anonymous

After several weeks of taking the drug I started having achy joints and difficulty stepping up, headaches and weakness in my legs. Motrin didn't help at all. I didn't correlate the symptoms and the drug. I went to my doctor and requested PT because of returning problems with my sciatica. During this time I stopped the Fosamax for stupid reasons. Sometime later I started taking the drug again.  This time it hit me like a brick wall. I was pet sitting for my son and literally had to pull myself up the stairs. Not realizing the drug was causing all these problems I asked for PT for my shoulder and hip. After 5 PT appointments my shoulder was worse and no improvement overall. Had a MRI of my shoulder and now have a torn rotator cuff. Yippee. Been through that before. I believe the Fosamax caused the tear and no clue about the hip.",Kitkat

It was so advanced that my doctor told me to participate in no activity, such a skiing, that could be me at risk for a fracture.  She more than strongly recommended that I start Fosamax.  Reluctantly, I started it, knowing the potential of all the terrible side effects.  I also committed that I would do a 30 minute resistance band work out 3 times a week.  I experienced no side effects, that I am aware of.  So one year later, I had another DEXA scan.  I am thrilled to say that I am no longer in osteoporosis but rather am in the osteopenia range or normal.  My density improvement ranged up to a 23% improvement.  I am going to continue taking it for at least another year because I would love to see if I could improve my density further.
