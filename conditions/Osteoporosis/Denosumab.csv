0,Denosumab,Osteoporosis,10.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"March 31, 2022",0,"Prolia (denosumab):I'm 67, almost 68. I just found this site and was surprised at all the negative comments and low scores regarding Prolia injections. I have been getting them for 3 years now. My bone density improved to -1.9 which is below the Osteoporosis condition moving me to Osteopenia status. I have not had any side effects that I could relate to the Prolia injection. I walk a lot and recently started hiking. I've done five 5-mile hikes and getting ready to start bike riding. I have arthritis but being active has really helped keep it at bay. I eat pretty healthy and take vitamins including fish oil and Collagen powder. Other than the hassle of timing this with my dental work and holding off on the next injection the required 4-5 weeks after I had my tooth pulled to allow the bone to heal, I can say I haven't had any issues. The benefit is not having a humped back or brittle bones.",Ginny

Although there was improvement in my bone density, three years ago two dental implants began failing and an oral surgeon had to remove them because the jawbone beneath them was showing signs of deterioration. I stopped taking Prolia immediately and reported the to problem to the physician that had prescribed the drugs but she seemed unconcerned about the problems. My oral surgeon told me he had seen an increasing number of patients with pretty severe jaw bone problems and did not recommend the current osteoporosis drugs because of the high number of jawbone issues he is seeing in his practice.  I have to agree— is it worth the risk to take these drugs?",Lyndy

4,Denosumab,Osteoporosis,,Taken for 5 to 10 years,"March 4, 2022",0,"Prolia (denosumab):I've been taking Prolia for 7 years now.  Of course, boards like this ALWAYS contain horror stories & never anything positive.  Like many people, I tried other drugs first like Boniva & Fosamax, but they did nothing.  I also spent the better part of 35 years taking calcium and vitamin D supplements, eating well, exercising, etc.. And yet, I developed advanced osteoporosis by age 56.  My mother also developed it around the same age; she was a heavy smoker & drinker for 3 decades of her life.  I was not.  I never smoked & am at best, nearly a teetotaler. So, I guess this can surely be a genetic condition & often no matter what we do for ourselves health wise, we can't undo genetics. Prolia has helped me to a certain extent.  I do notice that I have some hair loss (I am nearly 70) but my mother also had hair loss at the same age.  She never took Prolia. Like any drug, this one is probably not perfect, although if it caused all the things claimed here, I doubt it would still be available.",ThewayIseeit

6,Denosumab,Osteoporosis,,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"January 27, 2022",1,"Prolia (denosumab):I had my first Prolia injection in January 2021 and a month later I had severe pain surrounding a an implant in my lower jaw.  My dentist initially said it couldn't be caused by Prolia after just one dose, but if the implant needed to come out, I'd have to wait 6 months until the Prolia was out of my system.  This was enough for me to decide not to continue with the drug.The pain subsided with antibiotics because the area was infected, and my Xrays were normal  n March 2021.   Six months later, a repeat Xray showed a 50 percent bone loss surrounding the implant.  My dentist said that the  Prolia was the only explanation. And two oral surgeons told me their practices are filled with women who've either lost teeth or needed implants removed after taking Prolia. I just had my implant removed at great cost (insurance won't cover it) and the surgeon can't guarantee that bone-grafting will work so that I can get a replacement.  DON'T USE PROLIA!",CatMom

I have taken Fosamax years ago, but was tired of the staying upright for 1 hour and then I began thyroid meds.  Fosamax did help, but the femur fxs were happening with prolonged use.  My scan showed better in lumbar spine, worse in hips.  So in Nov. 2021 I took the Prolia shot.  The nurse said people have said they can experience lower back pain.

I started using Prolia 3.5 yrs ago as I could not tolerate Forteo. My Dexa t-score -3.6. My Dexa score did improve with Prolia. However, 'ONJ' is NOT rare! Prolia can cause jaw bone loss! I was told the issue 'ONJ' was rare, & since I'd only been taking Prolia for 3.5 yrs I could go ahead with a dental bone graft & dental implants. But, the dental surgery failed due to the effect Prolia had on my jaw bone, & now I have 'MRONJ'. Which means the medicine Prolia caused a hole in my jaw that is exposing jaw bone & refusing to heal. Although I am taking pain meds every 4 hours, the pain from exposed bone is excruciating even after a months time. There is no real prognosis as to how long this 'MRONJ' problem will take to heal, or if it will ever completely heal?I do NOT recommend taking Prolia!",Painful

27,Denosumab,Osteoporosis,8.0,Taken for 10 years or more,"September 2, 2021",3,"Prolia (denosumab):I am really astonished about the many negative comments on denosumab. May I explain why: I am a doctor specialized in rheumatology and osteoporosis and use this drug since in came on the market about 10 years ago, maybe in 200 patients in all those years. I rarely saw any side effects: few mild skin reactions for 1-2 days, mild reduced calcium in patients who didn´t take their recommended calcium/vit. D. Also colleagues I meet more or less regularly in bone meetings do not report serious problems.  NEVER saw severe joint or muscle pain with Prolia.The only thing which is confusing: if you decide to STOP the medication after using it more than 1-2 years, on sees a rebound phenomenon of the bone turnover causing strong loss of bone density within short time. And this effect can only partially be blocked by bisphosphonates - but if you stay with Prolia, everything stays stable, no loss of effect over time or so.",an bone doctor

39,Denosumab,Osteoporosis,1.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"July 1, 2021",1,"I quit Prolia BUT my doctor did not tell me you can't ""just quit"". Prolia suppresses your metabolic bone turnover so when you STOP or even DELAY an injection, your body goes into ""rebound"" & the bone disposal cells (osteoclasts) go into hyperdrive. The result? Plummeting bone density AND SPONTANEOUS SPINAL FRACTURES. I lost bone density to BELOW baseline but worse 10 months later, my spine spontaneously fractured in 5 places. The manufacturer DOES warn about ""rebound"" but we patients never hear about it. To prevent ""rebound"" you need to go on a ""relay protocol"" of an alternative antiresorptive & have bone turnover monitored. But many people can't take the antiresorptive & bone marker tests aren't available everywhere! This is a SCANDAL! If you want to quit Prolia, I beg you - insist you be monitored through a relay protocol. Those spinal fractures are crippling and far more common than people think.

My family physician chalks all of this up to my irritable bowel but I know my body and something else is going on.
