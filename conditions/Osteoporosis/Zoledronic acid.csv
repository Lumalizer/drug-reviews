But my lumbar number got to -4.4 and after trying other things to improve my numbers. I decided I needed something more. I had my infusion Monday morning with no prep. Felt fine until that evening. Then the diarrhea and cramping hit big time! Some nausea but no vomiting. My gut hurt, my teeth ached, my neck was stiff, and I couldn’t sleep for several nights. By the third day I was feeling better.  I don’t know if the prep would have helped but I have several friends who had no issues with Reclast.

I even road my stationary bike the same night. But oh boy!! at 1:30 am I woke up with chills, and body aches like I had just did a marathon. I could not lift my left arm up, it was sopainful. Every part of my body hurt especially joints and areas that I have arthritis (osteoarthritis) . I am at day 5 and the body, muscle and joint pain are gone but I have no energy, am so tired and I have this headache for 4 days that is bothersome. I called the infusion center and the nurse stated headaches this far from infusion date is not the norm to call my primary care doctor. Made an appt. I would not tell anyone not to take this medication. Each person reaction can be different. I believe that if this medication works as is stated. I can deal with the temporary discomfort. But time will tell. All I know is I would rather have these symptoms that are not great than to have the pain of a fracture or worst be debilitated.",Willow
2,Zoledronic acid,Osteoporosis,,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"March 8, 2022",1,"Reclast (zoledronic acid):My experience with Reclast was one of the worst things I have ever been through (including 6 back surgeries). I had my infusion on 12/6/20. By the next day, I couldn't move to get out of bed, without crying. It felt like every bone, & I mean every one, was breaking. I had to tell Siri to call my daughter, who came straight over (40 min away).  She had to help me out of bed, but everywhere she touched me, again felt like the bone was going to break, & all I could do was cry. I'm 66 yrs old, and have dealt with a lot of pain. This had it all beat!  My PCP called in a medication for arthritis, & my daughter covered my whole body with it. I had to use a walker to get up & that was still excruciating! It tanked my blood of all the vitamins needed. I was anemic & had to see a blood specialist. I went through this for 2 months, until my PCP put me on steroids. It helped but didn't completely remove the pain.  Finally, this month, the pain is gone. 14 months of that poison in my body!  BEWARE!",Not a chance!

By midnight I was shivering and shaking and ached all over, then intense pain set in, in my sternum and left breast and arm. I could hardly breathe and seated coughing. Temperature rose to 40 and severe sweats. More Panadol which did nothing. Pain worsened and could hardly walk. In the morning phoned lady who administered Alclasta who said was all normal and could subside in a day or two. Phoned my Dr who sent me straight to hospital where I spent the next 12 hours on pain relief, a drip and tests for suspected blood clots, thankfully none. I was kept until my temperature dropped and my blood pressure (190/98) to its usual 130/75.  Day 3 sternum pain has lessened to bearable, right arm still very painful as is my back.

Tylenol does nothing for me. I took advil and arnica the day before, during and after.  It has helped me with other procedures. I also asked for a 60 minute infusion not the15 min. one that is suggested. I read in a medical school publication that 60 drip has way fewer side effects...They don't tell you this...so you have to as for 60.min...I even gave the doc a copy of the article. A good friend trains nurses on infusions and she also confirmed that slow infusions are always better than quick ones - less pain, almost no side effects. Try to get the longer session. I  asked. They said yes ...no problem. Bring a book, phone  or tablet to keep yourself entertained. And something to drink while you're in session and something to eat after.

My dexa score showed severe osteoporosis-3.6 in lower spine. I agreed to try Reclast despite my concerns over side effects. Although I initially experienced very mild side effects from the infusion, 3 months later I developed severe lower back pain, and left hip and leg pain which I can’t tolerate walking up stairs. I now must take meloxicam daily and  I’m sure that this back hip and leg issue is a side effect from Reclast. Reclast attempts to build bone density at the expense of cellular changes in which the body normally fights off inflammations and arthritic conditions. Do the research! There are a FEW blogs which detail women who take Reclast, and then several months later experience severe arthritic exacerbation.  This is MY STORY. My back is better due to 5 consecutive days of acupuncture BUT my left hip and leg are in pain. I won’t be doing Reclast again. The cure is worse than the disease!",Piano Teacher

It turns out that Reclast has the about same efficacy as Actenol (if taken as directed.)  Per the manufacturer, 2 glasses of liquid should be consumed before an infusion of Reclast in order to avoid kidney damage, and Tylenol at the time of the infusion can minimize the side effects.  I'm a few days post infusion with no side effects (yet), although  I skipped the post-infusion water.

As a radiologist, I have seen many a spine with osteoporosis and multiple compression fractures that significantly reduce quality of life so I took the risk.   I hydrated prior to infusion but did not immediately take NSAIDs.  What a mistake. 8 hours after infusion (3 AM) I started to have severe, uncontrollable rigors (shaking chills) and diffuse bone and muscle pain that I have never experienced before.  As a reference point, I fractured my right pelvis years before in the Navy and I know what pain is.  Fever and chills improved with NSAID (first tried Tylenol and may switch to Naprosyn.  The pain is still severe.  The other testimonials are scary but I also know that there is no free lunch in medicine.  Everything we do is a balance between what helps and what does not.",rshelin

After a few days, I called my MD and got muscle relaxants, ibuprofen, and topical NSAID's (diclofenac), but they’re not really helping. I just started a new job and am trying very hard to work through this, but I’m really getting worried. I need some serious dental work, too, but I’m not really inclined to take the assurances that it will all be fine in a couple of months at face value right now.
