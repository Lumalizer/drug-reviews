0,Alendronate,Osteoporosis,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"March 15, 2022",0,"Fosamax (alendronate):I was asymptomatic but deemed high risk for fracture since diagnosed with osteoporosis.I respect some who’ve  actually benefited from Fosamax. However, this has been a drug nightmare with symptoms similar to others here on this site. First week taking weekly Fosamax 70 followed next day by non stop diarrhea for remainder of week. Second week dose 2 had ongoing diarrhea,  chills, nausea, fatigue and debilitating cramps as if punched repeatedly in stomach. To my FP’s irritation, strongly refused further treatment after 2 weeks stopping prior to 3rd dose. Also declined Prolia injectable as alternative as it must be followed by oral bio phosphates after injections discontinued. I’m still dealing with diarrhea and fatigue impacting quality of life.Please do extensive reading on side effects before pursuing Fosamax or other bone health drugs. I’m now pursuing a more natural option through exercise, nutrition, vitamins D3, calcium, K2 and fish oil.",Boodles67

2,Alendronate,Osteoporosis,9.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"March 4, 2022",0,"I have finished nearly a year of taking liquid Fosamax (alendrolate) for osteoporosis. Previous to this I took ProLia.  I stopped ProLia due to the inconvenience of going to hospital for the injection.  I had my dexa scan this week and I am thrilled!  I have gone from osteoporosis to mild osteopenia, a big improvement as I am in my 80's and my osteoporosis is longstanding. I did find that the liquid is much easier to take and I'm convinced it absorbs 100%. I'm beyond thrilled with my results. Another year on the liquid and l will have normal bones again! My suggestion to sufferers of osteoporosis who don't like the tablets to try the liquid. For me it works. My medical team is happy because it is a new product for them, and the numbers don't lie. It's  a good outcome",Georgia senior
3,Alendronate,Osteoporosis,1.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"February 18, 2022",0,"Fosamax (alendronate):I reluctantly started taking Alendronate on November 6, 2021.  In addition, I had a knee injury and had begun physical therapy a few days earlier. My knee hurt when I kneeled or squatted, but I could walk without pain. I did not notice any issues for the first 3 weeks, but had started limping.  I attributed the limp to the physical therapy and focusing on the injury, rather than the Alendronate. The pain got worse, and I spent a lot of time elevating the knee and wrapping it in ice.  Meanwhile I finally had an MRI that verified tears in the Meniscus. By week 7 I purchased a cane to help me walk.  It hurt to roll over in bed.  My hips hurt, my leg hurt, everything hurt.  I took the 8th dose on Christmas Day.  I had suspected the pain might have more to do with the medication than the injury. I went on line and read how others had similar reactions.  I decided to stop.  Within 2 weeks the pain in my hips was gone, and by the end of January I was no longer limping.",Anonymous

After taking the first pill, the next day I had severe heartburn.  So bad I thought I was having a heart attack.  Was given OTC Nexium which did nothing.  After a month the heartburn continued.

About the 3rd week I noticed that I was having different pain in my foot/ankle and knee. My right foot pain is shocking sometimes (goose bump). Right foot heel/ankle hurts when walking. Went for a nice walk at the beach last week-end and felt slight pain in my hip area. Just not sure if this is due to the medication? This is the response I got from my MD Hi.  I haven't heard of this medication causing this kind of pain; I think this is likely a coincidence.  If the pain continue for another month, then it may be worthwhile to go off of the medicine for a month and see if it makes a difference.I stopped taking the medication and the pain started to go away a few weeks later. The pain has now come  back. I have intense pain in both feet and ankle's.  It hurts to walk, and when I try to stretch my foot the pain goes thru the top of my foot to my ankle.",Anonymous
