0,Premarin,Osteoporosis,10,,"August 19, 2017",30,"My Dr. retired & his replacement stopped 5 of my drugs (all now prescribed by specialists). However, Premarin was stopped for 1one anda half months. Two weeks later, 40 hot flashes a day began. I felt like I was going to die. Finally, an endocrinologist re-prescribed Premarin but only 1/2 the dose I had taken for 32 years (since 40). Hot flashes are still outrageous. All my sisters have osteoporosis, but not me (I took HRT).  In the time it was stopped, I lost weight, lost 1"" in height, about 20% of my hair, and I'm so tempted to order it online without a prescription so I can take the other half of my regular dose. Desperate people do desperate things.",For Petes Sake
1,Premarin,Osteoporosis,10,Taken for 10 years or more,"October 9, 2016",39,I started taking Premarin 1.25mg when I lost my ovaries at the age of 28 to endometriosis. That was 33 years ago. My symptoms were lack of focus and energy. Within a week or two I was back to my normal self with the exception of the mood swings I'd had ever since puberty. Several years ago my GYN said there was an alert about Premarin and I would have to wean myself off of them. I went down to 1/4 of what I was taking within 7 months. I was taking large doses of ibuphrofen for over 25 years for inflammation in my back. When the Premarin was decreased and the ibuphrofen was taken down I developed extreme arthritic swelling in some of my joints. I was put back in the Premarin immediately and told to never get off.,Gator1228
