1,Risedronate,Osteoporosis,1.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"January 14, 2022",1,"I took two monthly doses of this awful poison, Risedronate.  I immediately felt nausea, burning in the stomach, horrible heartburn (never had heartburn before), severe bloating, gagging, and extreme fatigue.  This lasted 25 days then I felt good for five days and took the second dose.  Again an awful experience. It has been 8 months and I still have extreme fatigue and my stomach is nauseous all the time. Some days, I lay on the couch all day.  I didn't have any medical problems before taking this, no  other health conditions, I was a healthy, active 60 year old!  This drug is awful and I can't believe the FDA gets away with this! I am now under the care of a naturopath who is trying to repair my gut.  By the way, I got bloodworm before I took this drug and again after the two months and my ferritin level went from 49 to 29 and I became anemic.  The FDA knows it's a bad drug but they make money off of it at our expense.  No thank you.  It should be taken off the market.",Anonymous

Well I couldn't figure out what was wrong with me about 2 Monday afternoons per month. Until this week when I had another terrible episode, tremors, joint pain, terrible leg cramps, muscle aches, dizziness, fever and chills. Each time I had to go to bed the side effects were so bad. I called my pharmacist and he said :PLEASE go off the Actonel right away"" . Now what does that tell you? Yes I have Osteoporosis but I will just take my over the counter Calcium pills. Oh and the RASH.is horrible..I am going to see a dermatologist. I will never take Actonel again.",Actenol

By that afternoon I was very tired, heavy in my body, next day loss of appetite, diarrhoea and after 5 days severe inflammation and extreme pain all over my body. Then 3 months of fatigue, muscle weakness, pins and needles in face and arms, blurry vision, loss of voice volume. After 12 months my strength is slowly returning but I still fatigue easily and regularly experience pins and needles in my face, and medications I used to be able to take now trigger headaches, fatigue and pins and needles in face, hands and arms. I would like to know how long before these symptoms pass but nobody knows. This drug should be taken off the market.",Jane

Spent all day at emergency. They didn't think it was from risedronate...what else could it be? The only different thing I had done. Next day....pain is also bad.

6,Risedronate,Osteoporosis,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"November 3, 2021",1,"I started risedronate 1x a week.  The first week, I thought my arthritis was getting bad in my hands and feet.  After the second dosage, I snapped a tendon in my wrist by simply straightening a tablecloth, a few days later, a 3 year old fracture in a finger erupted and is re-fractured for no reason, I felt like my achillies tendon was going to rupture, any previous fractures were suddenly hurting. I could not use my wrists to use door knobs, couldn't turn keys and felt I had become quite disabled.  The doctor ""never heard of this reaction.""

8,Risedronate,Osteoporosis,1.0,Taken for 5 to 10 years,"May 4, 2021",26,Actonel (risedronate):I am a 66 year old man who after 5 years showed NO improvement in the hip area with Oral Bisphosphanates (I took them religiously the way you are supposed to and did not have any digestive issues).  With the Oral Bisphosphanate my hip BMD degraded.  The spine only showed minimal improvement.  Two years ago (2018) I had a fragility fracture walking down the sidewalk & broke my hip!    After that I was on Forteo which gave a 21% increase in BMD of hip!  I am disappointed in what Actonel did not do for me.  Maybe the FOSMAX name brand is better because of better manufacturing standards.  That is something I do not know.,honest316

I has now been 3 months since I discontinued this drug and I am still not back to where I was before.  Fatigue, bone and muscle pain continue.  Walking is difficult some days, painful most days.

The side effects left me unable to be any distance away from a toilet due to sudden attacks of diarrhea. This lasted for the first 2 days after taking the drug. Also the pain increased and I felt like an old man despite being only 40. Over all it interfered with my fairly active life that I enjoyed so I stopped taking it.,Kayman

I thought necrosis of the jaw meant the bottom jaw and ignored a problem with my upper jaw.  I have been getting dull aches in my hips and sometimes searing pain down my legs.

I did not relate the problem I was having to the drug until after I stopped taking Actonel. I developed dry eyes.  They were so bad, they would wake me up every night five or six times and I would have to put eye drops in so I could go back to sleep.  During the day, I would have to excuse myself from meetings, etc. to leave the room to put eye drops in my eyes.  I went to several eye doctors and all they could do was say I had dry eye syndrome and wanted me to start Restasis.  I had read that you have to use this forever and I was reluctant to start it.  I put up with the dry eye problem for years. My doctor took me off Actonel after the five years and after a few months, my dry eye problem completely went away!!  I was so surprised and appreciative! Even while I was on Actonel, I read the side effects and nothing was ever mentioned about dry eyes.
