0,Meloxicam,Tendonitis,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"March 2, 2022",0,"The first day, unnoticed and stiffness in my back, but I had driven a lot that day, so I didn’t think anything of it. I began having more pain each day, like repetitive muscle use strain in my right mid-back (kidney area and up) and spreading around to my right side. On day 5, I stood up to walk, and my whole left side seized up and started spasming, from my rib cage and obliques all the way around my side to my back all the way up. I couldn’t catch my breath. Every time I moved, it would seize. The pain was unbearable. Tylenol helped, but It went on for hours. Luckily my gut was the medicine, so I stopped. It started to slowly improve, but two days after, it was like someone had beaten me up. My muscles ache so bad + loose stools, burning in my abdomen. The nurse told me it might take me up to a week to get it out of my system. Thank goodness I stopped taking it. I don’t know what the outcome might have been.",C - l - g

3,Meloxicam,Tendonitis,10.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"June 10, 2021",1,I had moderate pain at the top of my left foot up to mid-ankle area. Felt almost like a sprain.  Doc put me on one 1.5mg per day and the pain stopped within 24 hours. Probably one of the most effective meds I have ever taken. I have been taking them for about 3 months now and I am gonna stop to see if the pain has gone for good. I am very pleased with the results.,KEVCO
4,Meloxicam,Tendonitis,3.0,,"September 9, 2020",9,"Diagnosed with tendonitis. Given by my dr. meloxicam 15mg. I been taking it for a month with a glass of milk to prevent stomach damage every morning and haven’t seen much progress! No side effects so far, but can risk it if it’s not even helping much! I’ll stop it.",Cinammon
5,Meloxicam,Tendonitis,1.0,,"January 21, 2020",8,"My injury was strain of pelvic joint where it attaches to backbone Took Meloxicam 15mg as prescribed for two weeks. Did very little to relieve pain. After two weeks almost no improvement. It did not stop pain, maybe muted it for about 17 hours then nothing at all. It was suppose to last 24 hours. Had to supplement it with Tylenol. Now switching to Diclofenac so we will see.",Libby
6,Meloxicam,Tendonitis,3.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"July 28, 2019",16,"My dr. prescribed this for a month to see if it helped with shoulder pain. Not sure what the pain is. My physical therapist (for another issue) thinks it's frozen shoulder. It did help for a few days, but not in a lasting way. And I've gained weight in the one month period - not sure how much be enough to really notice. Although I filled the prescription again, I'm not planning to take it. Doesn't make enough different to put on any more weight!",RoscoesMom
7,Meloxicam,Tendonitis,9.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"March 23, 2019",29,"After only three days on meloxicam my tendonitis is starting to feel much better, and that’s after a month and a half of suffering from chronic Tendonitis. I had never heard of this drug before my physician’s assistant prescribed it. Wish I had known before.",Sudferer
8,Meloxicam,Tendonitis,,,"March 7, 2019",19,"I have De Quervain's tenosynovitis and I was doing ok but this week super tight shoulder leading to hand pain and a severely decreased ability to grip things. So I took one meloxicam (prescribed for dqt just in case, but hadn't been taking them been) yesterday around 6am. I'm also insulin dependent diabetic. By 10:30am I felt sick and blood sugar was grossly high. It didn't matter how many times I took more insulin, my sugar would not stabilize all day. It was as if this NSAID was a steroid. Didn’t seem to alleviate my suffering either, just gave me more problems. Blood sugar did not begin to level out until midnight. Not at all normal.",Tar
9,Meloxicam,Tendonitis,4.0,,"December 2, 2018",14,"I’ve had tendinitis deep in my groin, since January, 2018. I’ve had 18 sessions of acupuncture, which provided temporary relief. My Doctor prescribed meloxicam, in September.  It doesn’t really seem to work. I also had ten weeks of physical therapy, with daily stretching.  I live in a two story home and the stairs sure don't help matters.  Thinking passing on the drug. One day, My face got extremely red and swollen. I blamed it on the Santa Ana winds in Southern cal. Could be the  Drug",Les
10,Meloxicam,Tendonitis,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"August 17, 2018",38,"As a distance runner for over 50 years, every now and then, I get injured.  The latest knee injury was after several hard long runs, both knees really hurt and couldn't run for four weeks.  Went to my Dr. and he prescribed Meloxicam.  Within 24 hours, the pain was gone.  I will update this site with the next three days and any possible side effects.",Eddie
11,Meloxicam,Tendonitis,,Taken for less than 1 month,"April 14, 2018",13,"I went to the emergency room yesterday after having severe shoulder pain for 4 days. Xray confirmed calcific tendonitis. After an intramuscular muscle relaxant shot I was discharged with a sling and a 10-day prescription of Meloxicam 15mg once daily. It's now been 2 hrs after taking my first tablet. I feel woozy, but pain is much less, yay! I was also instructed to take sling off several times a day and do gentle pendulum moves to avoid the shoulder joint stiffening. Think the combination of gentle movements and Meloxicam will help me.And I see from some of your posts though that this med can cause serious issues and my hope for you (and me if develops) is for relief, maybe an alternative therapy. Thank you for posting your experiences. Much love and healing to all of you.",Doe7

13,Meloxicam,Tendonitis,10.0,,"November 3, 2017",12,"About 2 years, I was lifting weights and hurt myself. I was told that I have costochrondistis. I had a very hard time breathing and made few addtional trips to the ER. At my age, the DR thought maybe it was my heart and sent me to a cardiologist who performed many tests, but all the tests were negative including MRI/CT Scans. I got better then the issues flared up. It got better again, but 2 weeks ago I couldn't breath  I decided to go to another DR who asked me many questions and finally gave Meloxicam 15 mg. I have been this med for about 2 days and god do I feel the different. My abs are no longer tender and there is no tightness in my chest. I no longer suffer and am able to breath freely. Thank God",Joe Krupski

15,Meloxicam,Tendonitis,9.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"August 25, 2017",19,"After about 4 other anti-inflammatory drugs did nothing for severe tendonitis in my knee (sports injury) the meloxicam was the magic bullet.  5 days was all it took to get the swelling down and the healing to begin.  I had 3 months of nearly intolerable pain up until that time.  Of course, your milage may vary since one data point is not a trend.",MxG
16,Meloxicam,Tendonitis,6.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"August 1, 2017",14,"While my pain subsided, the side effects were awful. My tongue swelled up, I gained 4 pounds in a week, and am seriously retaining water. I got the okay from my doctor to discontinue yesterday and am looking forward to feeling normal again. Not worth the side effects, in my opinion. I'd rather take ibuprofen.",Plantar fascia tear
17,Meloxicam,Tendonitis,8.0,,"April 6, 2017",14,"It took away my pain, but made me drowsy and depressed. Also, it made me retain serious water. I recommend only taking this as a serious last resort!",ArizonaDude

19,Meloxicam,Tendonitis,2.0,,"February 21, 2017",14,"In my experience with Meloxicam for an unspecified tendonitis in my outer wrist (my doc isn't real detail oriented), the drug doesn't do squat.  I should mention that I have both a high tolerance for pain as well as an unusual resistance to the average painkillers. No external reason like built-up tolerance to anything, I only regularly take asthma medication and tegritol.For me, Meloxicam might as well be a placebo; add that to the troubling list of possible side-effects and I've contacted my doctor to disregard any refills and offer an alternate, more effective painkiller.  It might work wonder for others, but to me, Meloxicam just didn't do it.",DrkAnjl7
20,Meloxicam,Tendonitis,10.0,,"January 12, 2017",28,"I have been on Meloxicam for four years now.  I worry about long term problems or might cause,but nothing else has helped my wrist pain.  If I skip a day or two, my wrist is weak and in tons of pain.  As long as I remember to take the meds, I'm pain free.  I recommend meloxicam.  It's been good for me.",MMicheleF
21,Meloxicam,Tendonitis,1.0,,"April 20, 2016",20,Had pain in my hands from driving to much.  After 8 months or so I found my self in the ER then the ICU of my local hospital.  After a couple scary days and many test it was determined that I had a bleeding ulcer in my esopogas.  Lots allot of blood.  Doctor told me that this medicine most likely was the clulprit.  I would never recommend this to anyone.  DO NOT TAKE,JonPJNY
22,Meloxicam,Tendonitis,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"April 7, 2016",13,"I have severe calcific tendonitis in my right shoulder. ER prescribed this yesterday and started it last night. Just left the er once again for severe allergic reaction. Woke up with red puffy face a rash all over my body and it did not do anything.

24,Meloxicam,Tendonitis,9.0,,"September 30, 2014",63,"I am fighting plantar faciitis and have been in horrible pain which shoots up my leg. I know it is from walking the dog on the beach for miles at a time, though I wear good shoes. Meloxicam absolutely has taken away the pain. I am trying to figure out, however, how to soothe and heal my foot without having to depend on a medicine for more than 6 or 8 weeks. I believe Meloxicam is an excellent bridge in an acute situation. Yoga stretches also are really helping, especially the sun salutation, which stretches my calves and tendons in my feet. I believe that way I can get through the worst while protecting my stomach.",beach walker

Starting taking it yesterday and for the first time in days I was able to sleep without waking up in pain. Can now move shoulders and pain has been greatly reduced.",dumparse
27,Meloxicam,Tendonitis,6.0,,"October 2, 2013",63,"Benefits did not outweigh side effects experienced. I am a runner with tendonitis in my left foot.  My doctor prescribed meloxicam, 15 mg to reduce inflammation and manage pain. I took it for a month and I experienced side effects like dizziness, stomach problems, and inexplicable weight gain (despite the fact that I was swimming, biking, and slowly starting to run again).  The small reduction in pain was not worth the side effects, so I am back to about 800 mg of ibuprofen a day.",Runner32

I found another Dr. & he prescribed Mobic. I have almost NO wrist pain. It is amazing what a difference it makes.
