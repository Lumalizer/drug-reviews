2,Naproxen,Tendonitis,6.0,,"July 19, 2020",7,"My doctor prescribed me 500mg naproxen taken twice a day.  I've been taking it for about 2 months and it has helped me tremendously along with my low dose muscle relaxer. (I only take the muscle relaxer when I'm home for the rest of the day or right before bed. Makes me very tired.) I take my naproxen at 9:30am every day and my second dose around 3pm.  Most days are close to pain free but this past week has been different. This is the second day in a week I've had horrible pain. (My doctor says it's tendonitis but I'm going to a different dr because my doctor basically stopped trying to figure out what's really wrong with me.) Today even after my 2 doses and muscle relaxer I'm still in agony.  I can feel my muscles in my shoulders spazzing and the pain is almost burning through my arms, shoulders, neck and head. Before this week I would have rated this med a 9/10. But now I feel like my body is becoming too used to it. Has anyone else had a similar experience?",Nicole
3,Naproxen,Tendonitis,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"April 5, 2020",15,THIS DRUG HAS RUINED MY LIFE. In fact I might be dying from The adverse effect it had on me  I took it for tendonitis in my wrist. It reduced the pain but gave me a VERY SEVERE ADVERSE EFFECT. For the past 7 months my head is constant pain. I have numbness / tingling in my head. Also both of my hands developed numbness and pins and needles sensation as well. I have been to 3 neurologists and I'm trying to figure out how to undo these crippling effects that Naproxen has had on me. I can't exercise or basically do anything because it hurts my head. It feels like my head is constantly being squeezed. I also experience dizziness and vertigo if I try to be active. Be very careful if you take this drug. It has destroyed my life. Try any other anti inflammatory  medication before this one. If you are on a benzo be very careful taking this medication. NAPROXEN HAS DESTROYED MY LIFE.,chip

I was prescribed over the counter Aleve which is basically Naproxen twice daily for 2 weeks, then once daily for two weeks. I experienced immediate pain relief. I'm now on my third week at once a day and feels great with no side effects. Definitely on the mend. Not much into taking any kind of meds or drugs but sometimes we need them to help us recover.

I was told by the doctor to stick to over the counter pain killers but none of them worked over a 4 week period. When I returned to the UK my doctor prescribed 500 Naproxen and 15 mg Lansoprazole Gastro-Resistant capsules. After 2 doses the month long pain subsided and I had no side effects.

Often times all I'd have to do is take Aleve and rest for a day or two and the pain would go away.  This time I'm having to lay off the heavy weights (for good) and wear the brace, but use Aleve as well.  The combination of the two is really working!
