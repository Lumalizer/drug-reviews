0,Indomethacin,Tendonitis,,,"April 4, 2012",9,"AMAZING! I took my first dose at 3pm and a second at 9:30pm and as of right now (1am) I have zero pain in my finger. I've been unable to do the easiest of tasks like make a bed, open a cap on a drink etc. I can make a closed fist with no pain at all. I'm so happy! I have a few more weeks on Indomethacin I hope it lasts. I'll write another review then! SO excited I can have my life back!",cellargray
1,Indomethacin,Tendonitis,9.0,,"July 7, 2010",26,"Indocin SR (indomethacin):I have a lot of inflammation relief with Indocin. The problem is that I can only take it every other day. I am 37 and very active, train Brazillian Jiu Jitsu 2 days a week. Get tendinitis in my shoulders easy. I would recommend this medicine.",Brilow
