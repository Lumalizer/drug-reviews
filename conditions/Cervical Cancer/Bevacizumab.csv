0,Bevacizumab,Cervical Cancer,10.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"July 2, 2019",21,"Avastin (bevacizumab):My mother was diagnosed Stage IV cervical cancer a year ago. Doctors gave her 12 to 18 months of life. She went through 6 rounds of chemo and tumors are not visible in scans. Doctor said she is one of few people with this kind of response. Now she is on Avastin (third application) and doing great. Scans still clean and manageable side effects (mouth sores, dry skin and fatigue)  Doctor said he has seen cases of 30 rounds of Avastin and still responding. I hope this is the case for my mother too. Good to all of you and keep your hope!",Nene
