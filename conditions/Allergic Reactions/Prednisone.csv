0,Prednisone,Allergic Reactions,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"December 23, 2021",0,I was prescribed Prednisone for a skin rash. After taking it I started noticing improvements in the rash after 2 days and then the rash eventually went away after my prescription dosage ended. I still have no idea what caused the rash but I'm so glad the Prednisone made it go away!,jennerwalker
1,Prednisone,Allergic Reactions,10.0,Taken for 10 years or more,"November 21, 2021",0,"I am allergic to all forms of sulfite.  It is often a food preservative and is in all wine.  Even small amounts cause my throat and tongue to swell and itch.  I take a 10 mg pill of prednisone immediately after I notice this beginning.  It usually begins to work in an hour or so and takes away the symptoms within a few hours, sometimes leaving a slight soreness.  Being careful, this has never happened within 6 months of each other, usually much longer between incidents.",Nora
2,Prednisone,Allergic Reactions,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"September 7, 2021",1,"I was prescribed 50 mg prednisone, 1 per day for 4 days, after an emergency room visit after getting stung 4x by yellow jackets. I am allergic to bee stings. In the ER, a steroid was injected into my IV and the doctor told me to start the prednisone table that same day. I took 1 pill that evening. After a couple of hours, my sugars were through the roof. Over 400...overnight and the entire next day, I more than doubled my usual insulin dose without being able to get my sugars below 300, all without eating a thing. I am normally in great control of my diabetes but not with the steroid. I will not take any more of this. I will just deal with the swelling and itching. On the other hand, I was not itching and had no swelling. But just felt terrible with my sugar levels being so high.",Type 1 Diabetic

4,Prednisone,Allergic Reactions,7.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"August 3, 2021",1,"I was only prescribed this for four days, and it worked great to clear up my allergic reaction (had bad rash and swelling from sulfa drugs) but nobody warned me the side effects would be that terrible. the thigh and leg pain was so bad and I would get full body chills often. I started to get random light back pain too and I realized it was because the prednisone had lowered my potassium drastically. Eating yogurt and bananas helped for during the day but I would wake up in the morning with full body pains. My anxiety was also noticeably bad. I do have diagnosed GAD but my anxiety was twice as bad  on this drug, my mind would not stop racing all day. I no clue if it's just because I'm a small 100 pound woman (I often assume my weight factors in) but apparently these side effects are rare so. Otherwise it worked great, and probably will for a majority of people.",hele

6,Prednisone,Allergic Reactions,10.0,Taken for 10 years or more,"July 13, 2021",8,"Over the years I have broken out in hives on several occasions due to the binder in some medications, scraping my legs on a briny ladder in the ocean and most recently after a wasp sting on my hand. The only thing that works for me is a Prednisone taper: 10 mg tablets—4 for 3 days, 3 for 3 days, then 2 and 1. Always wipes out the hives and I get the added benefit that my osteoarthritis stops hurting. They do make me feel weird and interfere somewhat with sleep but I can manage that and am grateful that I can get reliable relief from the hives.",Dmwolman
7,Prednisone,Allergic Reactions,1.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"April 3, 2021",3,"I was prescribed prednisone drops 4 X daily for 2 weeks then 2 X daily for 2 weeks for cataract surgery.  As soon as I stopped entirely I started getting a rash on shin, feet, hips, abdomen, lower back, arms/shoulders, scalp.  It's spreading and becoming more severe daily.  Since there have been no other changes in habit, diet or environment I am attributing the rash to possible prednisone rebound.  I had a similar rash 2 years ago after a course of penicillin.  (side note: while on the drops the puffiness and drooping nature of my eyelid disappeared so that my two eyes looked very different.  Too bad the drug has so many side effects--it could be used instead of eyelid surgery.)",Islander

While its calming the flare a bit, this is the first time I've had seriously weird side effects.  Ovary pains, severe headaches, and leg aches with my third dose @30mgs.  I wonder if the ingredients are changed or if my body is just rejecting it?  Asked my doc, she is still telling me to stay on, but I don't agree as the pain is not bearable.  I guess a new rheumy might be in order.  Fwiw.",NY_nightowl

I was given a 12 day prescription of 10mg pills(6x2, 5x2, 4x2, 3x2, 2x2, 1x2) My initial reaction at 60mg doses was hyper alertness which tapered each day but nonetheless endless energy and focus.

16,Prednisone,Allergic Reactions,3.0,,"April 24, 2020",10,An ear infection and nerve compression resulted in bell’s palsy when my doctor prescribed prednisone tablet omnacortil 20mg full tablet morning and evening for five days and then reduced the dose slowly for next five days then only half tablet in a day next 5 days. As this drug can cause severe side effects such as confusion and allergies.  This tablet worked for me for the infection BUTTT as soon as I stopped using it my face neck started itching badly with severe acne all over them and then I went to a skin specialist and acne went off in a week but left the black spots all over....it’s better to take any other substitute of this drug cause I have been read a lot of reviews on this drug causing side effects and now my own worst experience,Safa
17,Prednisone,Allergic Reactions,10.0,,"April 20, 2020",20,"I took prednisone for about three days out of the five, because my symptoms began to lessen. The first day I felt so emotional and wanted to cry but was confused why I was so sad/angry. Medically speaking, the swelling subsided and I could breathe. Day 2 I wake up feeling INCREDIBLE I have so much energy and can’t stop smiling plus my eyes are white as could be and no swelling. I stay up almost all night because I can’t stop working. Day 3 I feel even better today and easily run 4 miles, complete a five hour case, work through the night, and my eyes are perfectly normal. On day 4 I decide to stop taking prednisone because my eyes are no longer swollen or red. On this day I felt weak, tired, and depressed. Day 5 my eyes become a little bloodshot again but no puffiness. Overall, I think the drug was a miracle for me but it definitely has an effect on your mind. For me, this was a bonus because I became much more productive and only had one day of negative emotions while taking.",a 22 year old female

19,Prednisone,Allergic Reactions,3.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"April 5, 2020",23,"I wish I would have read all these informative reviews before starting Prednisone. I will start by saying it was effective in addressing/suppressing my allergic reaction. However, I believe something else could have helped just as well. I just realized through all the reviews that I was experiencing side effects to the medication. I couldn’t figure out for the life of me why my blood pressure was increasing daily, the random chills, sweaty feet, random body temp changes, increase, loss of appetite, lack of mental clarity, anxiety flare ups. I now am wrestling with trying to get my mental state back. I am constantly second guessing everything I do like breathing, walking and talking. I find it extremely hard to concentrate without thinking I’m losing it. I just want my mind back. I wish my doctor would have done more research before prescribing me something so potent.

Thought I would try the prednisone..I have to say I was blown away by this drug! After 3 days rash was 90% gone and then all gone. Had rash for over a month using cortical steroid Rx w/ Benadryl to no avail. What also happened is I got a lot of energy, and felt really good and it probably had a lot to do with my arthritis symptoms in other parts of my body virtually disappearing. I also have plantar fasciitis and that caused a lot of pain whenever I walked ...but for five days I was going for hour and 70 minute walks walking very briskly without pain at all! All Arthritic pain was gone too and plantar fasciitis pain! Relief!!",Cat

23,Prednisone,Allergic Reactions,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"December 15, 2019",15,I think my hives were from a new laundry detergent or viral infection. Not sure which one but my doctor doesn’t know either... I was prescribed prednisone and it hasn’t seemed to help. It makes me feel so uncomfortable and jittery I am in tears. The worst part is it messes up my sleep and isn’t working!!! I’ve taken Benadryl and hydroxyzine and that doesn’t help much either. I guess my point of this review is to say prednisone hasn’t helped me and makes me feel like a crack head. Zero stars for this med.,A

I was on Benadryl for a few days for severe hives due to a food allergy. After Benadryl wore off, the hives would return. It became incredibly frustrating and scary since my throat would also swell, so I visited a minute clinic. They prescribed me with prednisone and it helped completely eliminate the hives. I would definitely recommend this for what I experienced. The side effects were not bad for me. I did not gain weight or experience irritability.",Rachel S

I tried 3 types of antihistamines for about 4 days and it was only getting worse. Then my doctor prescribed prednisone 50 mg once a day for 5 days. I was so concerned about the side effects that I read in the reviews, but I was desperate and decided to start the treatment. Within 20 minutes after taking the first pill my skin wasn't as itchy, and it stopped spreading in my arms. On the 2 day my face improved a lot, and by the 3rd day the rashes were gone!

35,Prednisone,Allergic Reactions,2.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"August 27, 2017",22,I was prescribed prednisone for an allergic reaction from taking antibiotics. It did an amazing job at taking away the rash I had and I would give it a 10.... but the extreme anxiety it gave me was the worst thing I've ever had in my life. The first day taking it I was prescribed 50 mg and my heart felt like it was pounding out of my chest for 2 hours straight.. I decided to cut the dose in half and only take 25 mg and it stopped the pounding heart but I still had terrible anxiety. I wouldn't recommend taking this if you have any type of anxiety or panic disorder because this will just make it worse. Oh and the nausea was terrible as well.,Cat249

Prednisone saved me, literally. I was going crazy from the intense burning feeling, severe itching and no sleep.

I had red itchy spots all over me and I was MISERABLE. I was prescribed a predisone pack of 21 pills 10mg to take over a span of 5 or 6 days and by the third day the itching and scratching had subsided tremendously. I'm not sure if it was an allergic reaction to something I came in contact with as I have never had a problem like this before.

Within 24 hours all the inflammation has subsided. I would take it more often if it weren't so harmful for my body.",Christine8585
55,Prednisone,Allergic Reactions,10.0,,"October 7, 2013",48,I had severe allergic reaction to shellfish twice and I took prednisone 10 mg for 5 days.

59,Prednisone,Allergic Reactions,9.0,,"March 8, 2011",47,"Deltasone (prednisone):We generally use the prednisone (Deltasone is the brand name) for our chronic lung disease patients. It seems to be effective for opening the air ways, but it is not for immediate rescue. We generally use it to keep the airway open after we give something like albuterol initially. Some things to keep in mind, your blood sugar may be checked because cortisones (which is what this is) can cause hyperglycemia. Also, cortisones can cause water retention and weight gain. Generally, over a long period of time, I have seen it also affect skin tissue, but it is better to be able to breath.",Therealnursesarah
