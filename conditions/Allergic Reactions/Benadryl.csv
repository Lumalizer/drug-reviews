0,Benadryl,Allergic Reactions,6.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"November 24, 2021",2,"So I've been taking this going on 2 years now, and I regret taking it so long, I even ended up in the ER because my heart wouldn't stop racing it was over 170.  I believe it was due to the Benadryl, I ignored the side effect before I noticed sometimes when I took it my heart would beat funny and it would be hard to catch my breathe but I kept taking it as it stopped my itchy throat, eyes, and mouth. Doctors at the ER found arrhythmia but said everything else looked fine. I stopped taking it, haven't take it in a week and I'm still having racing heart and palpations. Don't take this stuff long term. I'm in my early 20s and healthy if any one reading this was curious.",RosieGoodness

4,Benadryl,Allergic Reactions,1.0,,"August 10, 2021",5,Took benadryl for eight months on advice of PCP and Pulmonary specialist. I quit taking it because I began having short term memory problems. Checked it out on internet and found it should not be given to senior citizens. A neurologist at University Of North Carolina Memory Disorders unit said it should probably not be given to anyone as there are safer alternatives. I had  nervous breakdown and spent several days in a mental hospital. Had two MRIs of my brain. Second showed small area that was due to the Diaphenhydramine use. Alienated my family because of things I said . Without the Benadryl I wouldn't be the most heart-broken 74 yr. old lady around.,Anonymous
5,Benadryl,Allergic Reactions,,,"July 3, 2021",1,"I took over the counter Benadryl for some minor reason and hours later I started itching all over my body.  The itch was deeply intense from my scalp to my feet - a full body reaction.  I started getting visible large hives and my throat and face was swelling.  I went to the ER and they said it was impossible that I was allergic to Benadryl. The ER doctor was certain I was having a reaction to the pink dye in the pill.  He injected me with clear liquid Benadryl to prove this to me.  I immediately had a second reaction. They had to treat me with alternative medications; an injection in my bottom, prednisone to help with breathing and another green pill of some sort to take home with me.  I am allergic to Benadryl.",Talv
6,Benadryl,Allergic Reactions,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"June 24, 2021",0,"I had been to the doctor for hives for insect bite and they told me to use Benadryl cream and medicine, but it didn't help. I used calamine lotion, and  everything else I could think of even cortisone 10 extra strength it didn't help. I went to the doctor for the 2nd time they told me to use the same thing, no help at all. I was itching so bad the hives were spreading even the itching and burning sensations to my arm, ankles,  burning feeling in my fingers and hives spreading to my chest. I couldn't help but scratch them sometimes that probably caused to help spread, but I couldn't help it. I went to see another doctor for the 3rd time and he prescribed Prednisone and Hydroxyzine and this is my 2nd day taking them and I see a great difference. My arms and everything clearing up and I finally could rest.. I recommend Prednisone. I give it a 10.",Bitsybaby42

8,Benadryl,Allergic Reactions,10.0,,"September 4, 2020",1,"Benadryl is the Gold Standard for allergies, anxiolysis, and sleeping aid. It works like a charm! It is not particularly fast acting, though. I usually take a half a tablet(12.5 mg) at a time and it can take up to an hour to really kick in.",The Big A
9,Benadryl,Allergic Reactions,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"May 9, 2020",16,"This is an old thread but thought I would share. I was in the hospital in labor. I developed a reaction to the epidural that caused severe itchiness. They gave me something that didn't help and after several hours of itching, a nurse gave me iv benedryl. I immediately couldn't breathe and felt like someone kicked me in the chest. I was warm all over, nauseous and on the edge of passing out. An ekg also showed I had a heart arrhythmia from it. I've taken oral benadryl in the past with no problems. Now it's on my list of allergies and I tell every doc I see. Most terrifying experience.",Just me
10,Benadryl,Allergic Reactions,10.0,Taken for 10 years or more,"June 14, 2018",10,I've used this and given it to my children for over 20 years.  My teenage son would take 1 before going to bed so he could sleep without allergic reactions.  I've used it for unknown allergies like bee stings and sunless tanner.  Works great and so does the topical cream.  No adverse affects with us.,marlene1020

13,Benadryl,Allergic Reactions,6.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"October 15, 2016",18,"My adult size teenage son was given Benadryl IV, 50mg, *along with Compazine IV as a ""headache cocktail"" in an emergency room in September of 2016. While there is no way to know for certain if Compazine or Benadryl caused the severe reaction he experienced, he has tolerated oral Benadryl just fine in the past. However,  it seems important to share our experience based on the severity of his reaction that day and that multiple reports of similar exist. I do not recommend the ""headache cocktail"" of Benadryl and Compazine together and hope the number of similar reports are looked into.","Son, age 16"
14,Benadryl,Allergic Reactions,9.0,Taken for 10 years or more,"April 28, 2016",31,"I take one before bed which keeps me breathing easily during the night despite my allergies.  It also helps me get to sleep and stay asleep.  The active ingredient, dyphenhydramine HCL, you will find is the main ingredient in quite a few over the counter sleep medications so that should tell us something.  And Benadryl or a generic drugstore brand are cheaper and just as effective.  Have been taking this for over 20 years and have no side effects",Amensus

19,Benadryl,Allergic Reactions,8.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"May 12, 2012",20,I use this medicine for weather allergies and allergies to medications when I need it. It does help greatly but does not last long and my burning sensation comes back into my body and the hives start to show. However a lot of people say that this medicine makes them feel sedated. I have the complete opposite I take 1 before bed and I will not sleep.,Jen234
20,Benadryl,Allergic Reactions,7.0,,"March 14, 2012",14,"Works well and is one of my to go-to antihistamines. However it is very sedating and is also not long-lasting.

23,Benadryl,Allergic Reactions,1.0,,"October 20, 2009",35,A little known and rare side effect of this drug is a condition that would probably be called idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP). This describes a serious depletion of platelets in the blood. The blood will not clot properly and an injury can be life threatening due to uncontrolled bleeding. It's rare but if it happens and the cause is not figured out by your physician(s) this is a big problem.,Anonymous
