I believe it was due to the Benadryl, I ignored the side effect before I noticed sometimes when I took it my heart would beat funny and it would be hard to catch my breathe but I kept taking it as it stopped my itchy throat, eyes, and mouth. Doctors at the ER found arrhythmia but said everything else looked fine. I stopped taking it, haven't take it in a week and I'm still having racing heart and palpations. Don't take this stuff long term. I'm in my early 20s and healthy if any one reading this was curious.",RosieGoodness

I quit taking it because I began having short term memory problems. Checked it out on internet and found it should not be given to senior citizens. A neurologist at University Of North Carolina Memory Disorders unit said it should probably not be given to anyone as there are safer alternatives.

I went to the ER and they said it was impossible that I was allergic to Benadryl. The ER doctor was certain I was having a reaction to the pink dye in the pill.  He injected me with clear liquid Benadryl to prove this to me.  I immediately had a second reaction. They had to treat me with alternative medications; an injection in my bottom, prednisone to help with breathing and another green pill of some sort to take home with me.
