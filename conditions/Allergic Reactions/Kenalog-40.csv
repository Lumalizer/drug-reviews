0,Kenalog-40,Allergic Reactions,1,Taken for less than 1 month,"February 23, 2021",5,"The night I had my first and only injection, I had horrible night sweats. For the next week, my face has felt hot and I've been hotter than normal when sleeping. My menstrual cycle is also completely screwed up. I'm 37, not pregnant and am now dealing with what I would imagine hot flashes and night sweats to be and the erratic periods I had as a teenager. If I would have known the sides effects, I wouldn't have allowed my doctor to inject me with this drug. I can only hope this gets out of my system ASAP.",Bella5416
1,Kenalog-40,Allergic Reactions,1,,"October 31, 2019",8,"Worst drug EVER! I got the shot yesterday to help with a severe sinus infection I fought for 2 weeks. I expected jitters, BUT was never warned about dizziness; the muscles in each of my arms ache, I can't even put one arm above my shoulder; my throat is tight (I could still breathe, but swallowing was difficult). I woke up at 3 am with my chest having full convulsions--like upper body was on a paint shaker. Lasted 30 seconds. I almost went to the ER, BUT I knew they wouldn't be able to do anything. I called Dr this morning...and she said take some benadryl today & let them know tomorrow if it helped. I'm not sure what the course of action will be if it doesn't. I'm tempted to take some activated charcoal, but that will lessen the effects of my antibiotic; so i just don't know what to do. They said it's a slow release one so it'll be in my system for WEEKS! Weeks on benadryl is no way to live. I can't take the throat & chest tightness for weeks. So fingers crossed benadryl does the job.",poseidon_92
