0,Promethazine,Allergic Reactions,5,Taken for less than 1 month,"October 27, 2021",1,"Was prescribed Promethazine for nausea as two of my medications cause me to have severe nausea to the point that looking at food making me want to vomit. After waking up with severe nausea I took one low dose. Within a couple of hours I was extremely drowsy and my whole body began to ache several hours later it was so bad I had to finally lie down. I took my temperature and it was over 100 degrees and I felt like I had been hit by a semi truck. 24 hours or so later, all of the side effects have gone away. It helped with the nausea but the side effects were not worth it to me as it still made me feel miserable. Probably won't take it again unless I am desperate.",TyN

My face broke out in red, itchy hives, which spread down my neck and soon covered my entire body, head to toe. My throat began to swell up and my heart rate spiked.

6,Promethazine,Allergic Reactions,10,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"September 30, 2018",4,Promthazine is amazing. I have eczema and very bad itchy skin and it gets worse at night time. I take 25mg at around 8pm to stop itching and it starts to work in about 2 hours. It also helps me to fall a sleep which is good.I have been using it for just over a year now and I haven't had any problems. The only side effects that I have got from promethazine is tinnitus and its not pleasant but I can live with it.,alfred

8,Promethazine,Allergic Reactions,1,Taken for less than 1 month,"March 10, 2016",15,"Phenergan (promethazine):My son was given a one-time dose of 25mg of this drug intravenously for nausea in hospital, while on iv drips which included nitroglycerin, blood pressure medications, and pain opiates.He had a *severe* reaction, which included extremely high bp spikes (over 200 systolic), seizures, disorientation and hallucinations. The blood pressure spikes and seizures were extremely dangerous, as he had just suffered aortic dissection. It was fortunate that this drug reaction was not fatal.This drug should have a huge warning against usage with blood pressure meds, as that is a potentially fatal combination. The pharmacy should reject any request to use this drug in such a combination.",DontUseWithBPMeds

10,Promethazine,Allergic Reactions,10,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"March 30, 2015",19,"Phenergan (promethazine):I got given it at first by emergency department when a rash was breaking out over my face.It works. But I also have anxiety and have found it to be way better than Valium etc.  I feel relaxed and too not sleep I'll just take half a tablet but at night the 25 mg tablet helps my allergies and is a god send to relax the mind.  I love it.  I've noticed some people take it for nausea. I have always used stemitel and that works almost instantly. And I have no adverse reactions to either. I don't know why they don't use this for anxiety and such",Tempylyra
11,Promethazine,Allergic Reactions,10,,"March 8, 2011",29,"Phenergan (promethazine):Phenergan (promethazine) is very effective for nausea and vomiting. It is generally not used for urticaria or respiratory allergies. It is very strong and will make you drowsy. I recommend taking it when you are going to lay low for a while. We don't give it IV any more because we had some serious tissue damage reported when it infiltrated under the skin. I am not sure that we still give it IV. Lately, it is either given as a suppository or as a pill.",Therealnursesarah
