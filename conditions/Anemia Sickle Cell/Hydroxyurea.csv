0,Hydroxyurea,Anemia Sickle Cell,10,,"September 29, 2020",7,"My son started hydroxyurea at about 6 months of life due to having complications from sickle cell basically from birth. His hemoglobin was dropping, spleen was very large, distended abdomen, jaundice since birth, and first hospitalization occurred at 5 months old due to high fevers after having swollen hands for several weeks. Given his history, we decided hydroxyurea was the best option. 2 years later, his development is normal and no visible side effects from the drug (serious risks remain). He’s smart, affectionate, runs, jumps, shouts for joy, and falls to the ground during tantrums. Hematologist every 2-3 months, limit social interactions especially with sick people, avoid daycare, evening showers, and penicillin as recommended. He’s been hospitalized 3 additional times for high fevers but never for pain. Hydroxyurea is occasionally paused due to blood count. I am thankful hydroxyurea works for him and continue to pray he’ll be cured soon of this illness. We live in the US.",Mom
1,Hydroxyurea,Anemia Sickle Cell,10,Taken for 10 years or more,"February 23, 2020",5,"I am a 69y/o woman with sickle beta+ thalassemia, was having multiple episodes of pneumonia yearly and my doctor thought adding hydroxyurea would lessen them as they are sometime indistinguishable from chest pain syndrome. Plus, my pneumonias were asymptomatic. I started taking it in 2005 and in the beginning, I had hair loss but over time, that adjusted although my hair growth is slow. I have had far less frequent crisis and have not had one since 2016. Before that, I had just 2 minor crisis. I have far less joint pain now and with taking glutamine (since 2018) with hydroxyurea, I am relatively pain free except for my back and stomach. But I plan to continue taking these meds until there is a cure for sickle. If you take it, you MUST follow your doctor's advice and see him regularly for blood tests, etc. It is not a med to not take with a cavalier attitude as it is to help prevent serious sickle cell complications and, for me, it does just that.  I am grateful to have it.",HCW
2,Hydroxyurea,Anemia Sickle Cell,8,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"January 18, 2020",3,"Male, 40, living in sub Saharan Africa- Lagos. I’m hbSS and my crises have become less frequent over the course of my life from 5 to 6 times annually as a teenager to max of 1 annually after age 25 till now. I took hydroxyurea for the first time 2 months ago recommended by my haematologist after an unexpected exchange transfusion. My usual short breath is reduced significantly I can climb flights of staircase. The doc says I wasn’t given before because they didn’t think it’s necessary. My nails and palms are usually pale and white but now look normal. Side effects include mild nausea- food doesn’t taste nice anymore. And some constipation - my distended stomach became normal around age 20 but is now back. I go off it for a day once in a while",Lopsy
3,Hydroxyurea,Anemia Sickle Cell,9,,"December 22, 2019",10,"My Experience with hydroxyurea For over 15 yearsI started taking this medicine when I turned 6 years old. Now I am 21 years old. Before hydroxyurea I often used to be hospitalized with severe pain and low iron levels. Since I started on it I have been hospitalized on average once a year, in fact a period of time went on for several years without hospitalization. I was healthy and living a normal life the years I was not hospitalized. I started with 500mg which then increased to 1000mg and then to 2000mg, due to the fact that I got older and put on weight over the years.To this day, I experience absolutely no side effects other than what the disease carries. It is fantastic that you now have other medicines that can perhaps replace hydroxyurea, but to this day you have nothing better than hydroxyurea. This medication is absolutely no cure. You must expect to have crises occasionally. One must have routine checks at the doctor. I live in norway which means a very good health care system",Anon

5,Hydroxyurea,Anemia Sickle Cell,8,Taken for 10 years or more,"May 23, 2018",15,"Hydrea (hydroxyurea):Hello. I have Sickle Cell Disease-SS Hemoglobin. My hematologist started me on Hydrea in 2001 & I'm still on it. I'm in my early 40's & it had helped me. I take 4 capsules 500 mg now, but in 2001, my blood count was extremely low. Once on it, it had increased my red cell count, while my white cell count decreased (which it's suppose to do). I have less amount of hospital admissions now. But I have to admit, even though doctors may think it's like a ""cure"", it's NOT! I've lately been having small pain crisis in joints that made me go to ER but not admitted about 3 months out of entire year. My RBC & WBC counts are still looking good. You HAVE to keep your doctor appointments & tests while on this medication. I do have extreme nausea & have to skip a day sometimes. This medication may work on one Sickler but NOT on another. Now we have another alternative. I hope my experience will help other Sicklers see pros & cons. But we FINALLY have a choice now!",smilingtiff

7,Hydroxyurea,Anemia Sickle Cell,3,,"January 19, 2014",31,"Hydrea (hydroxyurea):Im 18 years old and even though I wasnt a sickle cell patient who had many pain crises , my doctor had still been suggesting me take hydrea since I will be starting college soon ( I guess just to be safe). Since taking it, I havnt had any severe pain crises, but I swear everyday it feels like my back is in a small pain crises. Which is scary because I never know if it's going to become a full blown crises. Im always having to take pain meds, or missing school because of this. Im thinking about if I should stop taking it for a while to see if the hydrea is whats causing this pain. because it can be my birthcontrol pills causing it but I highly doubt it. I wish there were more reviews on hydrea so I could know if it was just me.",BreeM
8,Hydroxyurea,Anemia Sickle Cell,10,,"January 20, 2013",23,"When I first started taking Hydroxyurea it made me a little sick. Yet, after about 2 weeks I noticed a slight increase in energy and went from having a hospitalization crisis every 2-3 months to about ONCE a year. I still take pain meds for the smaller pains but my lifestyle had gotten MUCH better. I would recommend it to any person with sickle cell. ",JayDub76
9,Hydroxyurea,Anemia Sickle Cell,6,,"August 2, 2011",36,"Hydrea (hydroxyurea):Hydroxyurea significantly improves the frequency of sickle cell crisis, but it has a long list of adverse effects. But if the dose is monitored properly and complete blood count of patient is done on regular basis, than some of the adverse effects can be easily identified and managed accordingly.",dr_solanki
