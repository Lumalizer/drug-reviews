0,Hydrea,Anemia Sickle Cell,8,Taken for 10 years or more,"May 23, 2018",15,"Hello. I have Sickle Cell Disease-SS Hemoglobin. My hematologist started me on Hydrea in 2001 & I'm still on it. I'm in my early 40's & it had helped me. I take 4 capsules 500 mg now, but in 2001, my blood count was extremely low. Once on it, it had increased my red cell count, while my white cell count decreased (which it's suppose to do). I have less amount of hospital admissions now. But I have to admit, even though doctors may think it's like a ""cure"", it's NOT! I've lately been having small pain crisis in joints that made me go to ER but not admitted about 3 months out of entire year. My RBC & WBC counts are still looking good. You HAVE to keep your doctor appointments & tests while on this medication. I do have extreme nausea & have to skip a day sometimes. This medication may work on one Sickler but NOT on another. Now we have another alternative. I hope my experience will help other Sicklers see pros & cons. But we FINALLY have a choice now!",smilingtiff
1,Hydrea,Anemia Sickle Cell,3,,"January 19, 2014",31,"Im 18 years old and even though I wasnt a sickle cell patient who had many pain crises , my doctor had still been suggesting me take hydrea since I will be starting college soon ( I guess just to be safe). Since taking it, I havnt had any severe pain crises, but I swear everyday it feels like my back is in a small pain crises. Which is scary because I never know if it's going to become a full blown crises. Im always having to take pain meds, or missing school because of this. Im thinking about if I should stop taking it for a while to see if the hydrea is whats causing this pain. because it can be my birthcontrol pills causing it but I highly doubt it. I wish there were more reviews on hydrea so I could know if it was just me.",BreeM
2,Hydrea,Anemia Sickle Cell,6,,"August 2, 2011",36,"Hydroxyurea significantly improves the frequency of sickle cell crisis, but it has a long list of adverse effects. But if the dose is monitored properly and complete blood count of patient is done on regular basis, than some of the adverse effects can be easily identified and managed accordingly.",dr_solanki
