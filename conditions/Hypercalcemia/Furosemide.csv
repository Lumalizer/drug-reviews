0,Furosemide,Hypercalcemia,7,,"November 26, 2008",19,"Furosemide acts quickly and consistently. My only input is that you would do well to watch your potassium intake  since this medication dumps electrolytes at the loop of henle, in the kidneys. Eat your bananas, oranges and potatoes. ALWAYS let your doctor know you take it. My son was given an antibiotic, that also lowered potassium, and the allergist kept insisting that the baby did NOT take Lasix, that was for old people. I had to show him the bottle for him to believe that I had not mixed up medication names. Anyway, my son had to have a potassium supplement due to the medicine regime. This could have been dangerous for my son, hence my warning.",Brians Mom
