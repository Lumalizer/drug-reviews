1,Ursodiol,Gallbladder Disease,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"December 11, 2021",0,"I have very small Gallstones and  I've taken ursodiol for 2 weeks, the first 2 days I had no problems but each day since I've had headaches, stomach pain, back pain and very nasty diarrhea each day. I was seeing my Dr for constipation and while having an ultrasound a few small floating gallstones were found. I wouldn't advise anyone to take this med. It caused more problems than occasional constipation. I ended the use of it today and hope it gets better.",Mike

3,Ursodiol,Gallbladder Disease,,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"May 16, 2017",36,For 30 days I have been using ursodiol..  I have gallstones that has caused my gallbladder to become inflamed with chronic  pain.  I decided to use this drug because I don't want to have my gallbladder taken out.. I've changed my diet because only a few things to eat agree with me now.. My Dr suggested that I have the gallbladder removed because of the amount of weightloss. Honestly. I feel some relief since I've been taking the medication. My dosage 250mg pill three times per day with meals  but I was only taking 2 because I couldn't  eat a lot. Since I've been having  some relief I've noticed I can eat a little more but still no fatty sugary bad stuff.. I'm gonna continue my prescription and see if i get more relief..,Honeybee404
4,Ursodiol,Gallbladder Disease,10.0,Taken for 5 to 10 years,"August 11, 2015",33,"I have taken Ursodiol since 2006. I had my gall bladder removed in 1988 but for some reason I started developing gall stones in my bile ducts. I had three surgeries to remove gall stones before I started taking Ursodiol. I have had no surgeries since 2006. My problem is the drug, which is a generic has skyrocketed in price. I use to pay $10.00, I now have to pay $180.00 for a 1 month supply. I quit taking the drug, I can't afford it. Does anyone know of any discounts that are available for this drug? I have insurance, the pharmacist said the reason the drug has gotten so high in price is because of Obamacare.",kitchennazi
5,Ursodiol,Gallbladder Disease,2.0,,"January 31, 2012",25,"When I started the medication I had some loose stool, then 11 days after taking it I started to have horrible pain in my hands. Then my biceps and wrists were hurting so bad.  I stopped taking the medicine today so I will let you know what happens.",Anonymous
6,Ursodiol,Gallbladder Disease,7.0,,"February 22, 2009",29,Ursodiol has been keeping my Gall Bladder in check (excepton 01/01/2008). My prescription had run out 4 days prior but I still indulged in greasy pork chops. 3 hours later I was in the ER and nearly died. I had no pulse or blood pressure. Was touch-and-go for awhile. Worst New Years Day ever. Never to forget refills again.,kalawikimaui
