0,Plavix,Transient Ischemic Attack,1,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"May 6, 2021",7,After 2 Transient Ischemic Attack (TIA’s) one hospital stay for 3 days. I was prescribed Plavix. I had an anaphylactic shock reaction. The next day comments from the nurses wow I have never seen such a bad reaction and the physicians apologizing the following day for giving me plavix. First time a physician has apologized I realized how bad my reaction had been. IF you have any drug sensitivities I would choose something else first.,Sunshine
1,Plavix,Transient Ischemic Attack,9,Taken for 10 years or more,"August 14, 2019",25,"Have been on 75 mg Plavix and 81 mg aspirin for 14 years after having stent placed in carotid artery. Only side affect had been easy bruising UNTIL my last shipment clopidogrel from  Dr. Reddy’s lab. Shape of pill has changed (now white & much larger).  Now, after 30 days of use, I have very large dark purplish bruises on forearms. Looks like senile purpura. Need to find a another producer of generic Plavix!!",Cora
2,Plavix,Transient Ischemic Attack,5,,"October 11, 2016",19,"After my VAD Stroke I am on plavix.  I have a toddler that I still nurse. I looked up plavix for several days & talked to several doctors. Some said it was fine, some said it was not ok. After talking to so many people about it, I felt that it seemed ok to nurse on. I've been on it for a month and yesterday I realized that my 2yo is constipated. We are weaning ASAP now because I don't know what else it's doing to him, but it's definitely getting through. I just wanted to post this somewhere for other nursing moms to see. We are currently only nursing 2 times a day right now.",Nursing mother
