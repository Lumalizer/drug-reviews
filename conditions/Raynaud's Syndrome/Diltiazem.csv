0,Diltiazem,Raynaud's Syndrome,8,,"January 25, 2010",74,Cardizem (diltiazem):Recently diagnosed. Has helped tremendously on circulation and fatigue. I was amazed that I was able to grab a handful of snow for a short time without triggering an onset of usual numb painful cycle. I started off with 180mg and now on 300mg daily. I now have my thermostat set lower and get hot wearing long sleeves now! I'm a happy camper for the first time in years. ,Anonymous
