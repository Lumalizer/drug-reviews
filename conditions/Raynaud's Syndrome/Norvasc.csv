0,Norvasc,Raynaud's Syndrome,6,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"November 19, 2020",25,"I was taking amlodipine 5mg/day for high blood pressure when I was diagnosed with Raynaud's.  My dr. increased the dose to 10 mg/day and I had great results...for a few months.  My feet and ankles started to swell badly.  This is a known side effect of this type of drug, so be aware that it may happen.  I had to discontinue using it.",Brian
1,Norvasc,Raynaud's Syndrome,7,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"July 10, 2012",67,"At first I got fantastic results.  I have severe Raynaud's and was basically house bound.  It even presented in warm weather.  At first the Norvasc totally removed the symptoms.   They seem to have come back, however, and it is mid-summer.  I also take Ritalin for narcolepsy and I fear that it may be causing some of the symptoms.  I would recommend trying this medicine for Raynaud's.  I take 5 mg per day.",lleegle

3,Norvasc,Raynaud's Syndrome,8,,"October 25, 2009",101,"I've been taking 2.5mg for a month with great results and no side effects, until the weather got colder so the doctor increased dose to 5mg, partly because he wanted a better result to my high blood pressure as well. The sudden increase has caused severe sleepiness and a tight chest. I cut back to 3mg for now to ease into it and will increase to 5mg if/when the side effects decrease. I believe in caution and I know my doctor takes the same stand.",neeleymountain
