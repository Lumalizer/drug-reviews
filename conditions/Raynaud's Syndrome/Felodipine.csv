Seven months ago my new GP prescribed Plendil 5mg. The effect was immediate and suppressed the Raynauds symptoms HOWEVER I became very hot and flushed in the face.I was given 2.5 mg for two weeks and then went back to 5mg with no further problems.,Terencius
1,Felodipine,Raynaud's Syndrome,10,,"July 28, 2009",15,"My Raynaud's Syndrome is about 90% better. A cold steering wheel in the winter or early spring is almost the only time I have white fingers anymore.  I can shop in the dairy and meat departments now, and don't get cold at work anymore.  Taking felodipine has been a blessing for me.",Anonymous
