0,Nifedipine,Raynaud's Syndrome,5.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"September 20, 2021",1,"They think I just have primary Raynauds. I'm not entirely convinced... Side effects took a week to get used to. They still come and go. My heart rate is higher now, I get a reoccurring sore throat, and headache. But the Raynauds episodes are less frequent, and shorter. But I am uncomfortable much of the time due to the side effects.",Raynauds?
1,Nifedipine,Raynaud's Syndrome,9.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"May 26, 2021",1,I was started on this medication at 30mg then 60mg daily. It has been bumped up to 90mg. I finally am starting to notice. My hands seem to be warm more frequently and not freezing. And I now can put my hands under cold water without them burning. I'm actually surprised this medication is actually working.,jungejmzj
2,Nifedipine,Raynaud's Syndrome,5.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"March 28, 2021",0,"Put on medication to treat symptoms of Raynaud disease after suffering over a year. However taking medication 31 days I started new symptoms. Which was rapid heart rate and extreme tremors that lasted sometimes more than an hour in early morning after getting out of bed. After taking this drug for 42 days I stopped taking to see if it played a factor new symptoms. The same day I stopped I had a heart dr appointment. Told dr the new symptoms. He told me to change the time in which I take my atenolol from morning to before bed. Now a few days later new symptoms have vanished! I read online nifedipine causes rapid heart rate. Why couldn’t my heart dr put two and two together? These are the kind of things he should know as a heart specialist. Yes this did stop the Raynaud disease symptoms and the benefits were greater than the risk, but now the risk created new symptoms that would have continued to a big problem if I hadn’t stopped taking the Nifedipine!",Angelscry2
3,Nifedipine,Raynaud's Syndrome,10.0,,"January 20, 2021",9,"I have been dealing with Raynaud’s for 15 years.  I live in the south so for 4 months a year, I invest in those hot packs to keep my fingers warm when outside.  I also use warm water to warm up my fingers and toes. I love to snow ski but pretty much gave that up.  I tried various medications hoping to find something that would help.  Amlodipine did not help me.  I also tried a couple of other drugs that didn’t work.  I saw this site and asked my doctor for nifedipine and I’m taking the one that you take 3 times a day, 10 mg each.  It started working the first day!   A week later it still works!  I haven’t had to run warm water over my fingers, they haven’t turned white or my toes! Because I enjoy wine and after reading some of the other reviews, asked my doctor if I could just take two a day (7am and 2pm) and she said that was fine. I have had no problems with doing this for the last 4 days. I plan to just take this med during the cold months only.",Jackie
4,Nifedipine,Raynaud's Syndrome,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"November 8, 2019",48,"I am a 20 year old female who has been struggling to manage raynauds for years. I thought it was totally normal and that everyone experiences the numbness when its a little cold. After starting the nifedipine, results were almost immediate. They day after taking my first dose, I was laying in bed when I noticed my feet felt strange. They were warm, for the first time in what felt like forever. I had full sensation and could move my toes around effortlessly, I was absolutely over the moon. The next day, I’m walking around work and notice how soft and cushiony my feet now feel. It didn't hurt to walk. My hands don't get numb and stiff from 65F weather, and I don't have to sit on my feet at work just to keep the numbness at bay. My life has forever changed for the better now that I can function as a normal person in the cold",raven

My job requires me to ride a motorcycle and I also ride bicycles for exercise and competition.  I had been dealing with this painful condition  of Raynaud's syndrome for several years.  It became bad enough that during January, my toes would be numb for about 12 hours of the day.  I ended up with painful blisters on the ends of my toes.  I finally made an appointment with my PCP and he prescribed Nifedepine 30.  It is awesome!   No side effects and I only take it during the winter months.",Bam1429

It would happen even when I sometimes walked down the frozen food aisle in a supermarket. One day my cardiologist suggested I try Nifedipine. Said it possibly might help. Hands would get white and numb. Painful too. After 20 yrs, this was such a blessing to finally not have numbness and pain almost every day. I'm very thankful for it. No adverse effects at all!",Ang
8,Nifedipine,Raynaud's Syndrome,3.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"January 29, 2018",27,"I suffer from acute Raynaud's, in that I suffer it 24/7  even if in the warm my feet especially can turn into ''blocks of ice'' and I have painful stiffness of the hands and feet and a painful tingling rotating from one to the other all the time - if I get cold it is much worse. I was initially put on Nifedipine 5 mg three times a day which help with the worst symptoms for two months but the body adapted and it no longer helped as much. After tests my GP raised the dosage to 10 mg 3 times a day which has helped the Raynaud's somewhat but I cannot cope with the side effects of dizziness, sternum pain and extreme exhaustion so will have to revert to the lesser dosage of 5 mg which doesn't help me really.  I am most disappointed and frustrated and wonder if there is any other help out there ?",Revtz

12,Nifedipine,Raynaud's Syndrome,8.0,,"August 2, 2016",12,"It most definitely works at stopping my attacks when the cold hits. I used to have attacks all day, even if I just opened the refrigerator to take out the milk my hands would turn white. However, I get really bad muscle spasms. Mostly on my legs, but can be all over. I only take it when the temperature is cold and I know I will be outside watching a sporting event. I just started taking it again this week and have been getting muscle spasms in my jaw and behind my ribs as well as my calfs. It is the old things that allows me to be outside to watch my kids games so I will use it on a limited basis.",KathySab

I take this once a day in the winter and have not noticed any of the side effects mentioned (headaches, dizziness) but my already-bad leg/foot cramps get much worse -- sometimes debilitating. To counteract that, I take magnesium in the form of Calm at night...my cramps are much better!!

My whole hands go white usually 1-3 times a day. It's awfully painful and very annoying so I went to the doctor who prescribed 5mg of Nifedipine 3 times a day. It was great, my fingers and toes stayed normal and I felt fine. I did experience some bad dizziness and nausea for about 3 days so returned to the surgery and they lowered my dose. Since then I have felt comely fine and it's stopped my Raynaud's. The days I have forgotten to administer the drug my fingers have gone back to there old routine so it just proves it works.",Charliee

I haven't had any of the side effects such as rashes or headaches but I have been very tired and now that I think of it, it's probably because I've been taking it during the day instead of at night like I used to.

Had my Dr order it for me and in 2 weeks it calmed my pain in foot so it healed. All the skin peeled off with some toe nails and today I'm on 60mg once daily. Now, I've noticed that whenever my body has a stressful event-migraine chronic (botox) helps so much.

At that point I started to get very scared. Called my brother over just in case I needed to go to the ER. When he arrived he immediately wanted to call an ambulance. I ended up waiting it out and finally the shaking subsided. The headache still continued the next day, but it was not as severe.

I have Raynaud's syndrome and my hands and feet are constantly cold, blue, white, etc. If I'm in the heat or long showers, my feet turn bright red and get painful. If I'm doing physical activties my hands get red and swollen. Anyway, I took this medicine for the first time at about 8:30 last night. It's now 4am and my feet are bright red, swollen, and painful, and my only minor relief is to keep my feet elevated (which can get tricky at work). They are warm, and my hands are warm, which is much different than usual, but this swelling is very bothersome. I'm not sure which is worse- before the meds or now.

Thankfully my introduction to this wonderful medication means that my attacks are much less frequent, and my partner has remarked at the noticeable sudden warmth in my usually cold as ice hands and feet. The only real drawback is that without a satisfactory amount of food it collaborated with my naturally low blood pressure to make me feel faint, it does not mix well with alcohol and it does not seem to prevent emotion based attacks.
