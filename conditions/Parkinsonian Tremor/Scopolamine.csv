0,Scopolamine,Parkinsonian Tremor,8,,"August 1, 2016",13,"I got some because I was taking a vacation in the German/Austrian Alps and needed something to keep me from being nauseated.  Got the 1.5 milligram patch, put it behind my ear, and was amazed at how it changed my Parkinson symptoms.  Before the patch I had to use a walker (rollator) and a cane and I noticed I was not as off balance as I usually am and attributed it to the patch.  Came home and talked to my doctor about how I felt and he decided to put me on it long term, but to watch carefullly for side effects. I am walking thru my house now without any assistance but do take the rollator outside because I have 2 very energetic dogs and am afraid they may knock me over.",Zyphia1245
