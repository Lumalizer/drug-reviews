0,Imatinib,Chronic Eosinophilic Leukemia,,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"January 9, 2017",0,I was diognosed Chronic Eosinophilic Leukemia. Doctor started me with 400mg generic Gleevec and it helped right away but my white blood count dropped. So after a month I started 200mg everything was going ok until I got pneumonia.  At first   thehospital  couldn't figure out why. Then the oncology doctor told me to stop the gleevec. I'm still battling the pneumonia and I'm not on the pill for my leukemia. He told me to get better from pneumonia cause it might be a side effect of the gleevec  and after couple weeks he will evaluate and maybe put me on a different pill or maybe just 100mg gleevec.  I'm a bit bummed out but we will see...any suggestions anyone?,Eddie A
