Side effects comprises muscle cramps, tiredness and persistent cough. Has reduced my white cell count from 13 to <0.6  I have reduced my level to 50mg or half a tablet and my blood counts have remained stable over a 10 month period. I did this to aleviat the cramps and cough. Helped the cramps but not the cough. I still get tired but not as tired as I was prior to the medication.",Charleysw
