0,Prednisone,Eczema,,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"February 23, 2022",0,"I suffer badly  with eczema on my hands & it affects my quality of life but when I take prednisone it clears up completely but when I wean off them & completely stop taking them within 1 week I am back to where I started , it’s so frustrating as I suffer with bad eczema on my hands . I don’t want to be on steroids long-term so I do come off them .",JackieD
1,Prednisone,Eczema,5.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"February 2, 2022",0,"I was given Prednisone for 10 days and while I was on it my skin was a dream.  I literally had no rash and no itch.  It was wonderful.  The day after my last pill my skin returned to its normal horrible self.  Now my skin is reacting to everything I put on it, even creams I have used for years.  My face is also swollen (moon face) from Prednisone.  Hopefully that subsides soon. For me, Prednisone is only good while you are actually taking it and unfortunately you can not take for long periods.",Kat
2,Prednisone,Eczema,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"October 15, 2021",0,"Dealing with eczema the last 3 years Doctor prescribed every topical steroid there is, they did nothing but make it worse. Prednisone was finally prescribed itching cleared almost immediately, after the regime I had no sign of the rash, less than a week later.. back to square one. Ice packs relieve the itching but when working obviously not an option. What are the dangers of a very low dose for maintenance. I’d love a warm shower…",Tim
3,Prednisone,Eczema,10.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"October 2, 2021",0,"Fantastic.  Prescribed by dermatologist for bad atopic dermatitis and eczema.  Effective within 2 days.  40 mg x 3 days, 30mg x 3, 20mg x3, 10mg x 3 first time. Some later up to 50mg x3, 35mg  x3, 25mg  x 3, 10mg x 3.  I am diabetic also, so GP only sanctioned short term usage to stabilise, in between alternative drug regimes.  When things get bad, I go back to prednisone for a quick fix.",Pat Q
4,Prednisone,Eczema,2.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"September 15, 2021",0,"I suffered from eczema as a child but it went away by my teens. After having a baby at 22 it came back but I only had it on one finger. The dermatologist prescribed Hydrocortisone & gave me the same old recommendations: no detergent, cotton clothes, no perfumes, etc. With time it started spreading but not much. Every time I had a stubborn rash the dermatologist would prescribe Hydrocortisone. After some years it stopped working and the Dr. prescribed Clobetasol + a 20-day course of Prednisone. It worked but every time my eczema came back, it would cover more areas of my skin. I started waking up with swollen red puffy eyes and tears would burn like acid. The last time I was given Prednisone, all hell broke loose when I stopped. I've been dealing with redness, flaking skin & rashes on my face, hands, upper back, & inner elbows. I can't sleep, can't shower and the itch is bone-deep. I'm aware these are symptoms of  Topical Steroid Withdrawal (TSW), but I think it's because I took Prednisone.",eczema sufferer
5,Prednisone,Eczema,8.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"August 8, 2021",0,"I believe it's helping my late in life (50+) diagnosis of eczema though I'm concerned about the immunosuppressant aspect (especially now - August 2021). Itching definitely improved after just 1-2 days. I'm taking a medium to low(ish) dose (10 mg per day), and hope to taper off soon and use topical pred. and the other OTC tools mentioned here and elsewhere. I also prefer a lower dose because I get too insomnia at higher doses (20-40)",Carolinagirl
6,Prednisone,Eczema,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"November 6, 2020",9,"My hand eczema began when I was 56, prior to that I had never had skin problems. It started with bumps on my palms and fingers and progressed to resembling burns especially on the tips of my fingers. Prednisolone 30mgs alongside Flucloxacillin cleared it completely but as soon as I stopped the course it came back. I have now been put on another course for one month with a decreasing dose and after 2 days it is already healing at a fast rate. I do consider it an amazing drug but obviously it can't be taken too often. I am trying to find the triggers and have put myself on the carnivore diet to exclude food allergens, bought an air purifier and am using pet dander reducing spray on my little dog amongst other things. I think the key is to find what we are allergic to.",Helen
7,Prednisone,Eczema,6.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"July 23, 2020",4,"I developed eczema on my left hand. I thought initially I developed an allergy to my wedding ring after 6 years.  I stopped wearing my ring and it only got worse. I took predisone. It worked wonders immediately! My hand was almost normal again. About 4-5 days after I was done with my series of predisone, the rash came back and maybe worse. I am at a loss. I am trying everything.  I hate that I can not wear my wedding ring. I have it on my opposite hand and zero reaction.",Mick
8,Prednisone,Eczema,4.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"June 27, 2020",8,"Honestly don’t waste your time if you have long lasting chronic eczema. But do use if you’re having just a flare up. I stopped using steroids about three years ago and learned how to cope with my eczema. I had to move back home because of covid and my skin was NOT happy. My eczema started flaring on my back which I’ve never had, so I was prescribed this. The side effects were horrible, I couldn’t sleep, my chest was tight. It cleared my skin but when I got off of it my eczema got really, really bad. Worse than when I had started. Not only did the flare up on my back come back, but I redeveloped eczema on the rest of my body/face that I had previously had eczema years ago. It basically revived every single past flare up I had..",Mayo
9,Prednisone,Eczema,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"May 9, 2020",25,"My eczema was bad as a teenager and on and off again during my 20s and 30s, but after I gave birth to my daughter in my late 30s it came back with a vengeance. A doctor put me on one course of prednisone and my eczema went into remission for a full year. After that it never came back as bad and I used ointment to treat  minor flare ups. Now in my sixties just a tiny bit every now and then.  I think dairy free is a good way to go for the younger people with this condition. Eczema stinks. It’s horrible and I really suffered when I  was a teen.",Sarah Connor.
10,Prednisone,Eczema,5.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"March 19, 2020",8,"My eczema spread throughout my body and was a big issue. I used prednisone for the eczema and it didn't completely get rid of it but it did reduce the severity. However, a couple days after, the eczema returned.",James
11,Prednisone,Eczema,8.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"February 24, 2020",8,Prednisone is a steroid everybody knows. It is immuno supressor. If you take it with a diet which increase body immunity then we can reduce its side effects and take it for a long term.,Bbjadav
12,Prednisone,Eczema,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"February 7, 2020",13,"As a kid I had eczema back of knees, elbow creases, wrists, neck, feet which I grew out of as a teenager. About 32 years old I started to get rash on my chest, neck, all down legs and face. Drove me crazy. I was desperate. Went private and doc gave me prednisolone. Worked great for a few weeks (skin was all clear) until weaning off. Not only did it come back on chest and legs, it came back where I had it as a kid and all over my head. Same doc then sent me for UVB treatment for 18 months. Worked great till I weaned off then it all came back again. I found a food intolerance tester, tests told me I was intolerant to milk, tea (not caffeine) and blackcurrant. Cut them out completely for 3 months and skin all cleared up apart from scalp. Scalp never completely clear but manageable with scalp cream.5 years on I've learnt I can manage my eczema by the food I eat. Wish I never took prednisilone.I think it's called Vega testing. A machine measures your resistance to certain food in amps (I think).",Theloops1981
13,Prednisone,Eczema,5.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"January 12, 2020",43,"Have never had skin issues. A month before my 37th birthday my entire body broke out in a horrible rash. Was told I had severe eczema and was put on prednisone for 5 days. 40mg a day. My skin cleared up....and as soon as I was done with the prednisone the rash came back 10 times worse. I have never been so miserable. Itchy, dry, burning. Went back to see the doctor. This time he out me on 60mg of prednisone for 4 days...then 50...40...tapering off over 24 days. Skin cleared up again. 25th day...1 day being off the prednisone and the rash is already coming back. I do not want to be on oral steriods. I can't sleep, I am aggressive. Topical creams had done nothing prior.  Even cortisone cream didn't help with the itch at all. I know they will give me prednisone again. I mean this rash covers my body...face..arms..legs...torso. Please tell me there is something better then being in Prednisone.",Jaja
14,Prednisone,Eczema,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"November 13, 2019",17,"I've used prednisone off and on all my life for eczema (primarily on hands) or if asthma got bad.  I do consider it a miracle drug even though I have problems sleeping when I take it.  Besides a family practice Dr. or dermatologist, an allergist can be very helpful.  I had a test on my back for chemical sensitivity.  It was very helpful.  You can also have a blood test for food sensitivity. All of these things can aggravate eczema.",Suzie
15,Prednisone,Eczema,10.0,,"October 15, 2019",41,Because of my eczema I could not get out of bed nor shower without my entire body stinging or feeling like I was going to cry. I could not live my life or kiss my girlfriend. I used this drug for 1 week.  Prednisone really did the job for my severity. I was inflamed and could not sleep or eat. Prednisone got me back on my feet but It has not been long enough for me to know how badly my eczema will come back. I will re enter this in next few months. Though I believe people who do not watch what they eat and continue to have hot showers will eventually come back just as severe. My skin feels soft and clear all over my body after using this drug. I will keep eating healthy and keeping my stress levels at bay. All while keeping hydrocortisone with me at all times to attack minor flare ups and keeping my eczema to a minimum. I tried every natural way but my eczema just got too out of hand. I believe sometimes a chemical western medicine can help you get back on your feet.,James
16,Prednisone,Eczema,,Taken for 10 years or more,"October 14, 2019",13,I was put on Prednisone for some weird rash and it takes away like magic but every time I get off Prednisone it comes back I don't know what to do all I know is I can't stay on Prednisone for life and that's the only thing that takes it away I've been on it for a long time now it's been years it gave me stretch marks all over my body which I have not gained a lot of weight to even get stretch marks like this prednisone helps wonders but it has a lot of serious side effects but without it these rashes take over on my face and my body I wouldn't wish this on my worst enemy and I need some helps if there's a doctor out there that sees this message please help me find out exactly what these rashes are and what I can do to make them go away.,Anonymous
17,Prednisone,Eczema,,Taken for less than 1 month,"September 15, 2019",17,"I got little bubbles with pus on my palms last year, and I am still struggling with this. Doctor said it's a kind of eczema. They gave me allergy tabs (loratadine) and ointments. But it's increasing day by day I change many doctors, but they all repeat same medicines. I fed up and start searching on google the result was horrible that eczema can't be cured, but at last an article about medication for my kind of aczema. And the prednisone was there as medication. I tried it and the result was so good. It's did not fully cure my palms but better then before. Still using this and I hope somedays there would be a cure for eczema.",Qadeer
18,Prednisone,Eczema,9.0,,"September 13, 2019",18,"I've had eczema all my life but it was never bad it was just like a small pink rash on my arm that would go away after a while.  Well after I fully matured it got worse much worse.  11 years of trying to control it and finding some success only for it to relapse it has covered my whole body even my eyelids.Day 4 thus far on my  prednisone regime and the eczema is completely gone on my face and arms and is fading fast in other places.  Reason why I give this a 9/10 as oppose to a full 10/10 is because I experienced some side effects my first couple of days.  Nothing serious but my heart felt weird, not like irregular just weird but it went away within a few minutes.  Then I had insomnia for the first couple of nights, and woke up shaking but those are common for starting a steroid regime. If you've been suffering with severe eczema all over your body like me, then I highly recommend you ask your doctor about prednisone or drugs like it.",After 11 years relief

My number one go to fix is PREDNISONE!! when I'm really bad I have to be in the hospital to control it.Once I'm cleared up I use a topical ointment (Aquaphor),and (Gold Bond lotion for eczema) I'm not promoting these just letting you know what helps me once the itçhing stops it has to be the PREDNISONE A MIRACLE DRUG scale of 1-10 it's 20 for skin conditions and so many other things",1redqt
20,Prednisone,Eczema,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"February 2, 2019",93,"I am 55 and have used prednisone 4 times now, some of the doses were for approx 3 weeks and weaning off on a low amount taking every other day towards the end.Each time it has worked wonders and my skin managed to stay clear for sometime. I had no side effects.This week my skin was so bad, itchy puffy eyes, arms so uncomfortable I could hardly type at work, and severely affecting my sleeping. I  have been prescribed with 3 days of 30mg  as a short sharp dose. Within hours I felt better and my skin is clearing up, feeling and looking better. This is a shorter dose that my previous times and no weaning off time but maybe thats because its only 3 days. I think its marvellous and such a revelation to feel ""normal"" .

So you can probably understand my confusion couple months back when the edges on the underside of my hands and my palms started getting little zit like bumps, and the itch and irritation that ensued. I go to the doctor and get a steroid shot and a diagnosis of ""Dihydrous eczema""and sent on my way. Here's the thing, it will dry the eczema up ...and fast... buuut, it only lasts while you take the meds, and made my infected areas peel thick layers of skin off. I've had success with the 2 creams I have now, not the ones I had been given at first. But, if I come in contact with certain leathers, it will immediately break out again. So, if the condition is severe, take the medicine.. I did. But get Fluocinonide cream, that is better long term.",Nickels
23,Prednisone,Eczema,9.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"November 7, 2018",9,I’ve been struggling a new onset unknown blotchy rashes on my face that get worse with exercise.   I’ve never dealt with severe skin conditions and now my face looks scary at age40! After several different topicals for rosacea and contact dermatitis my internist gave me a medrol 5 day pack.  It started to calm overnight and cooled out on my intense workouts.  After stopping a couple days though it’s still heating up but not as bad with moderate exercise.  I’m struggling and going to try a second round but this is really hard to deal with and pin point why it’s happening.  I fear this steroid is just a bandaid,Jay

He sent me to an oncologist for further evaluation and I was diagnosed with thrombocytopenia or ITP, an autoimmune disease. He prescribed prednisone, 30MG per day which was eventually lowered to 10MG as my platelets count improved. It so happened that I also had eczema which I noticed nearly went away as I was using prednisone. I am thinking prednisone works on eczema which must be an auto-imune disease?",Tim

29,Prednisone,Eczema,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"May 26, 2016",103,"I understand the severe side effects. However, as one who has suffered from severe asthma and eczema, as well as intolerable skin itching in general, my entire life, I look at prednisone as a miracle drug. It allows me to breathe, stops the skin itching, and clears my skin up quickly. If there is another drug that will accomplish these goals, I would definitely give it a try. I am 47 years old, and all of my issues were considered ""childhood illnesses"" that would eventually disappear. Unfortunately they never did.
