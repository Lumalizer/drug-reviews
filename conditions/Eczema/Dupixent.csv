I stopped after three months because I developed conjunctivitis in both eyes as well as proctitis from it. A different dermatologist physician asst. just convinced me to try the child's dose this time. After three shots blurry vision, conjunctivitis and sore prostate has returned.

2,Dupixent,Eczema,9.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"March 8, 2022",0,"I started dupixent 6 months ago for severe eczema covering my whole body and bad asthma/nasal polyps.Four days after my loading dose my hands started healing up and in one month my scalp cleared up and my hair started to grow back. My asthma has only slightly improved and my nasal polyps still remain however the improvement on my skin has been miraculous and I can now use my hands again, have a warm shower without feeling on fire and sleep without scratching chunks out from my skin. I do have a few eye issues and joint pain in my knees/ankles however they are only mild compared to how bad my skin was before. I had no quality of life and I can now go to the park and play with my kids without coming home covered in hives. I definitely recommend giving it a go if nothing else in the past has worked. I was on so many antihistamines, strong steroids and creams that barely took the edge off and now I only need eye drops and moisturiser.",Melanie

After about 8 weeks my face began to become red, blotchy, itchy and scaly. I never had eczema on my face to any great degree. Now my face is a complete disaster. I can't even go outside. This is not topical steroid withdrawal (TSW). This is something totally different different.  My eye lid skin became red and flaky.  This was not listed as a common side effect.",Craig
7,Dupixent,Eczema,3.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"December 11, 2021",1,A week after starting this I started experiencing horrible upper burning/ cramping stomach pain(gastritis) I didn’t even know that was a side effect at the time and didn’t even realize it was from that so I continued the injections. I even went to the doctors and they diagnosed me with it and of course gave me more medicine. But a couple months of me on the shot I decided to be my own detective and look up the side effects and of course gastritis was on there but on the very bottom of the list. Positive things though it did make me less itchy and skin soft overall and clear up a bit but it was not worth it because every time I would eat I would get horrible pain. I’ve been off the injection for over a month now and the side effect is better but it’s not fully gone. Planning to do a cleanse though to get all this nasty stuff out of my system definitely continuing on healing my skin naturally now with foods and health.,Sarah

9,Dupixent,Eczema,8.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"September 23, 2021",1,"This medication works but it Dupixent is impossible to work with. They told me it would cost $20,000 a year. I reached out and over a long time, found someone who could help me get the drug with no copay. After taking it and appreciating the results, they just upped my monthly cost to $747.05. My doctor, CVS Specialty Pharmacy, and my insurance company each told me they can’t help me. I asked CVS Special Pharmacy if I can just go off it cold turkey. Nobody there has called me back with the answer. By the way, I’m supposed to take the injection tomorrow and they just informed me yesterday that I have this new copay.

11,Dupixent,Eczema,1.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"September 15, 2021",2,"I have had eczema since birth. I am now 68 years old. My dermatologist told me about wonderful results had been achieved with this drug, and that chance of side effects would be minimal.  I was desperate to escape the topical steroid treatment and so after a year, I cautiously moved forward. Within four months my skin was clear, and I was free from chronic itching and rash. It was like a miracle. Then 6 to 7 months into treatment with Dupixent, I experienced a sudden visual loss. I  was hospitalized and had diagnostic testing. No significant findings. Just told to discontinue Dupixent. It has been 4 months since stopping it. I was out of work for 3 months adjusting to this life altering event. My left eye is still blind. My eyes stick together and I use lubricant constantly. Recently, I was finally able to get some glasses that help my good eye.  But everything is still hazy. I guess this is a long term visual effect of the drug.  That’s the risk you take.  So much for miracles.",Anonymous

13,Dupixent,Eczema,10.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"August 11, 2021",1,"I absolutely love Dupixent. I'm someone that had eczema all of my life and overall sensitive skin. Cerave moisturizing cream made me break out all over, it was so bad at one point. I went as far as to not shower as much to build my natural skin barrier, do away with loofas and only wash with Aveeno eczema body wash. It stopped for the most part when I moved from polluted NYC to WI but then suddenly when covid was starting up, my entire back broke out out of no where and started to travel throughout. Docs said it was my eczema and I told them that I don't have good experience with creams/ointments and they recommended Dupixent. I don't needles, but my skin completely cleared up, and my body is finally healing and evening out. It's absolutely worth trying this out!",Stormy
14,Dupixent,Eczema,1.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"August 3, 2021",0,"For a very expensive drug that I still had to pay over $800.00 a month for this was a pure joke.  First of all injecting the injection stung like heck so painful that I cried, then later on my skin became super itchy & very dry.  This went on every day.  My eyes became dry & itchy & my vision became blurry that it was hard to see when driving.  I finally got off it because I didn't see much difference in my skin after I started.  This is not a cure btw. Will wait until the new oral drug for Eczema comes out & I'll definitely try that one, but Dupixent just didn't help me one bit & getting rid of the big box it came in with all the dry ice was a hassle too since you can't recycle boxes in my area, you have to cut them up in small pieces & bag them for the garbage men to dispose of. I won't miss that part one bit or having to recycle the used needles either each time & having to run to the post office to do it.  Nope not worth it!!!",Anne
15,Dupixent,Eczema,1.0,,"July 28, 2021",7,"My adult son had a reaction to Dupixent that has never gone away. He had eczema on his hands, feet, arms, and legs. He began taking Dupixent in high school, and, while all of his body eczema went away, he began getting it more and more on his face. At first the doctor said it was a reaction to sunblock, but he continued to get eczema only on his face when not using sunblock at all. Then that doctor stopped practicing medicine. My son had never had any face eczema before Dupixent. NONE. It is obvious this was due to the Dupixent. He uses all non-toxic products for washing both body and clothing. His face got worse and worse. I have photos.  Even though he has quit Dupixent for about a year, his face continues to break out in terrible painful eczema. It flares up especially in the heat & plain tap water can even irritate it. He has burning, itching, and red scaly blotches all around his forehead and eyes. It's not only uncomfortable, but it's also embarrassing.",CN's Mom

It only covered for $13,000 per year and after receiving doses for several months my son max out the copay. Now we are back to square one. We are out of copay assistance program and no doses  for him. It’s a ridiculous system to begin with.

The itchy rashes have almost totally disappeared and I have my life back. BUT after several months, my eyes started itching day & night. After much trial & error, I use a combination of Lotemax lotion (prescription - very good!), Restasis drops, Pataday anti-itch drops, and (on bad days) an application  of cool water with apple cider vinegar. Highly recommend the Lotemax. Good luck everyone!",Vicky
19,Dupixent,Eczema,7.0,,"July 9, 2021",3,"I have had eczema my whole life.  My dermatologist said dupixent would help me.  I was willing to try anything to get my skin back to normal.  My doctors office didn’t know price, told me I could get a copay card and it would cover whatever my insurance didn’t pay.. Come to find out this medicine cost over $3,000 dollars a month and my insurance only covered a small portion of it. So in 6 months I have no funds left.  I am not able to reapply due to only 1 copay card a year.  And who has the money to pay over $2800.  The medicine was great, cleared my skin, but once I haven’t had the injection my skin flares up and it’s worse then when I started the medicine.  I will no longer be able to take this medicine.  So my warning to other people trying it is to know all you can before you get started.  I would have rather not started this medicine if I would have known what I know now.  Everyone says they are here to help you but yet there is no help.",Sherry

I had not had any skin issues prior to this, except occasional psoriasis on an elbow or knee in the winter.Began Dupixent in February and it was better within a week!

21,Dupixent,Eczema,10.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"April 19, 2021",9,"I've had eczema all my life and was a constant battle between pills and creams. Nothing seemed to help for more than a week or so. After hearing about dupixent, I was hesitant to get an injection every other week. However, after a few injections I started to notice and feel the difference. The injections do hurt very bad. The medicine burns going in. I had my mother give it to me in my arms for about 2 years. Now they they just came out with the auto inject pen, I just got some samples from my doctor before switching over completely. With the pen, I give it to myself in my thigh. It still hurts badly, but it is worth it. I do fear about having kids in the future and getting off of it or if it will have side effects on my baby.

My dermatologist gave me a prescription eye drop to take - it has not worked.  He said he does not think it is a side effect of dupixent, that he believes it is simply an eczema flair up, possibly due to the weather in New Jersey.  The dupixent people disagree - they think it is a side effect of dupixent.  So my dilemma is - do I stay on dupixent and continue the eye problems or go off dupixent.

It looked different from the ""normal"" rash that I'm use to seeing.  Now a month later that ugly rash is still here, but I'm not ITCHING. Hopefully, it will heal quickly, but did I say that I don't itch.  I'm 45 and I have had eczema all of my life.  People that have eczema know about the itch and how amazing it feels to scratch. For the first time in my life  I believe this is what normal feels like.  No itching, no scratching means no rash. I can't wait to completely heal, Dupixent is giving my that opportunity.",Deedee

Constant itching, threw away so many blood spotted shirts, couldn't wear short sleeves, everyone always thought I had poison ivy, couldn't sleep without heavy antihistamine which made me non-functional the next day. I was skeptical when my Dr mentioned this drug. I've used every lotion and potion on the market, the success stats weren't that impressive and giving myself a shot every 2 weeks sounded awful. But, 10 days in, my Eczema was gone. Not reduced. GONE. It's been about 7 weeks now and my skin is clear and hasn't itched at all.  I'm lucky my insurance covered it, and I still worry about as yet undiscovered long term side effects, but this medicine has been a life saver for me.",Sara
96,Dupixent,Eczema,7.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"February 4, 2019",22,I had eczema my entire life and from middle school and up until May 2017 I had control over it and you could not tell I had it. Something changed in 2017 and I had the worst flare up that I can even imagine. Finally I started dupixent in Nov 2018. It has changed my life. I used to be embarrassed to go places bc my skin was so red and bad. Now I’m almost as clear as I used to be. The only negative side effect was that it caused blurry vision and an eye infection. Went to the eye dr and fixed that. Haven’t had any problems since. Another downside is the cost. Luckily I got dupixent myway or I would’ve been paying $3000 for my refills. I currently pay nothing,Gigi

I have suffered with Eczema my whole life (28 yrs old), recently turning into Dermatitis Eczema after an episode of Eczema herpeticum. I have tried absolutely everything from steriod creams, UV lights and was recently on Azathioprine for 4 years, but no real change! I started on Dupixent last week, and I can honestly say this has been life changing! I am actually managing to sleep through the WHOLE night...  I don't have to hoover my bed every morning because of dry skin, I don't itch constantly, and I feel 100% better in myself! I panicked at the thought of having to self inject, but it was nothing.... I panicked over nothing, so if you're reading this and haven't had your first injection yet.. please don't worry! Thanks again to whoever invented this medicine!

Somehow after starting the treatment my eczema has worsened. Flaring up in places it’s never been before. Flaking and even peeling all over my hands. I have seen no change in the amount of itching. I have done 3 injections and do not notice any good results at all. I will stick with it though because I still have some hope that this will help clear up my eczema. I'm hoping that because I started it during the cold and dry season that it doesn’t work as well.,K

I had eczema covering my hands for over a year, to the point where it was painful to touch anything or type on a keyboard (something required everyday at my job). I had trouble cooking, because to prep food I often needed to wash it, which caused major pain on my hands. I was embarrassed to shake other people's hands. I was embarrassed to be in public. I tried every steroid cream, I tried diet changes, I saw multiple dermatologists. Getting approval for Dupixent was a bit of a hassle, but in the end, it turned my life around. I now have occasional small patches of eczema, but for the first time in my life I've had months where none of the skin on my hands is broken.

I used many cortisone creams & ointments.  I began to see that cortisone was less effective & I worried about long term absorption.  Dupixent was recommended.  I am on month 4 of using and all I can say is Wow.  The first month or so, it was hard to see an immediate difference with my skin but I noticed a significant difference in regards to itch. I was less itchy, and hardly any scratching.  I saw my skin begin to heal.  By month 3, I saw a significant improvement with my skin.  Another positive is that Dupixent makes my allergic responses milder (sneezing, itchy watery eyes, etc.) I know that every individual may have a different experience & reaction with this medication, & it might not work for everyone.  I would strongly suggest at trying this for a couple of months if nothing else is working.  To me, it has been life changing and I don't say that lightly.",D.

The side effects mentioned to me were itchy eyes, conjunctivitis, cold sores.  I stopped the Dupixent in October of 2017; so I took it for about a 2 months, 4 injections in total. I decided to stop as I began to feel my lips forming a cold sore and my eyes were terribly itchy. While on Dupixent, the itch it caused my eyes was unbearable. In May of 2018, I visited my Ophthalmologist again because my vision was slowly getting worse. There, I was diagnosed with having Keratoconus which is a condition where the eye is no longer round but bulging. This was said to be caused by excessive rubbing of the eye.

I'd tried everything from topical steroids to acupuncture, eventually resorting to nausea-inducing antibiotics (cefadroxil) once my flare-ups became so severe that I would break out in constant skin infections and had to take weeks off work at a time. It's been a year since I've begun using Dupixent, and my skin is 95% clear. While I still have very minor redness behind my knees and neck, my skin overall has elasticity and softness, and I no longer have flare-ups of any kind. I can wear the clothes I want, sleep through the night without itching--but most importantly, be confident in myself again.

I would have tears and painful cuts that hurt and burned constantly and only worsened after having my second child.  The itch was so crazy.  The only thing that kept it at bay was a relatively high dose of prednisone which I did not want to be on because of the side effects.  I had even tried cyclosporine which didn’t even touch it. I was started on dupixent in November 2017 and my skin is 100 percent clear as of June.  I saw improvement within the first month in that I didn’t feel quite as itchy, but I first noted significant improvement at around 3 months.

Needless to say I went shopping around and I was quoted and paid a $85.00  copay. I gladly paid and proceeded with my next two injections. After which, the sores were nearly gone except on my elbows, knees, and butt which still itched terribly, especially at night making it impossible to get a reasonable nights sleep. Not one to give up easily, I ordered my third treatment of Dupixent only to be told that the copay was now $700.00. Considering the cost vs effect, I have discontinued the treatments.",Nazure
137,Dupixent,Eczema,,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"January 27, 2018",13,Was in clinical trial and steadily the incessant itching went away... Have been on the drug more than 3 years and have calm skin. Still prone to minor flares if I over heat or get too stressed. Initially had itchy eye rims but now wash lids with baby shampoo in shower and it stopped.  I carry mild steroid cream just in caseI  feel a sense of itching coming on....oddly I have increased thick hair growth - no hair thinning as before. Rarely get sick. Seem to heal faster.  I sometimes feel as though itch might be coming back just prior to my second shot of month,bravogolden

140,Dupixent,Eczema,8.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"January 18, 2018",5,"I have had eczema my whole life from scalp to feet. It had been a nightmare. I started dupixent about 4.5 months ago. About 2 weeks after getting the initial dose, I started getting cold sores weekly. My doctor put me on a daily dose of Valtrex and that has subsided. It took about 2-3 months for my skin to clear up. My face and neck have cleared up, but not as well as the rest of my body. I still have peeling skin on my face and some redness. There is some eczema on my neck and chest. Overall I am happy with the results. I am a lot less itchy. I just wish my face would heal as well as my body. Hopefully in time it will heal too.",Sarah A.
141,Dupixent,Eczema,2.0,,"January 9, 2018",13,"Life long eczema with periods of clear skin.  Had severe bouts for 10 years and was on a plethora of drugs cyclosporin, Cell Cept & Methotrexate.  I was very clear on the metho, but my Dr. wanted me on the Dupixent.  It seemed to work initially, however, as stated above-it starts wearing off at around the 6th day - so by the time I am to take my next shot, I have a full flare going.  For my weight I cannot have a dose every week.  So, each month my flares are worse and I don't clear prior to next shot to the point that I am full flare (25% of body) now all of the time at 6 months on the drug.  I have decided to go back to the methotrexate Very disappointed.  Was NOT the end all be all it claims to be (for me).",nelliekitty
142,Dupixent,Eczema,8.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"December 21, 2017",9,I have tried several popular medications but have had the best results with Dupixent. Within three days after the first dose I noticed that my skin was not as itchy and the cracking skin began to slowly heal up within ten days. I am on my third month and I must say that it is making me a believer. I now don't have to peel  away my dead skin or use my soap stone to scrub it away. It is a maintenance drug so I guess I am stuck with it until something else comes out. i have no negative side effects or reactions as of yet.,Happy Skin

I’ve been taking this shot since September 2017 and it is currently December 2017. I no longer have eczema ANY WHERE. It’s truly amazing. The only reason I’m giving this a 9/10 is because I’ve noticed it wears off slightly before my next dose. Meaning, since I take the shot every two weeks, I’ve noticed the eczema comes back slightly on my face and neck a few days before my next injection. I understand I have to build it up in my system. This has truly taken away all my eczema that I was suffering with before.",Anonymous

Recently however, the redness and itchiness has been returning and I am concerned. I read in the studies that 20% of the patients in the trial saw results initially (within 3-4 months) but then developed an immunity to the drug so that it was no longer effective.

147,Dupixent,Eczema,,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"November 2, 2017",7,I started having eczema issues later in my adulthood (40)  I am now 57 and have been to many dermatologist with different forms of treatments . The number of trips and the time spent taking time off from work was effecting my quality of life. I started the clinical trials for dupixent approximately 6 months ago without much success. I actually had new flare ups during the trial period. I decided to stop treatment because I felt I was injecting a placebo into my body because I read there was 50% chance this might occur . My dermatologist recommended that I start taking the dupixent immediately after my trail period so I could get relief to my skepticism . I have been on this treatment plan only a month and have been getting  good results.,Norman Y

I mean everywhere, tried to everything, scratching constantly, all night, in meetings, after the shower, I've lost sleep, cried a lot, been miserable.  I've been on Dupixent for two weeks and my skin has never felt so smooth!!  Cleared up about 85% of my rashes after about 4 days after my first dose.  When I sweat no itch which is so rare.  I don't wake up to dry flaky skin everywhere.  I'm so happy and amazed, I hope it keeps workin like this because my quality of life is gonna be so much better.  God this stuff is great!!",John West

I never knew when waking up what my skin would look like due to scratching in my sleep. I started Dupixent in July with immediate results after the first dose. Itching was gone, 98% clear skin. My allergies as a result of taking this medicine have calmed down as well. I did notice that in the review people mentioned that they had problems with their eyes. I experienced this side too and almost stopped taking the medicine. When I spoke to my dermatologist he assured me that my body would get use to the medicine. Within a month my eye issue stopped.

Most of my problems have been on my right hand, but it gets so severe my hand can't function.  After my 4 week injection I started to see flare ups in new places....legs and around waist, as well as serious inflammation on upper chest and back of neck (all new to me) and believe me I did start to panic.   Actually my hand looked better than the other places so I was happy and sad. I know someone else here posted the same experience.  Anyway, had 6 week injection yesterday and now seeing results everywhere.    I was losing hope but I am now seeing light at the end of the tunnel.

My allergist was a bit disappointed as I still have some eczema -- I am about 70 percent clearer.  I haven't been using any steroid creams so maybe with those we would see better results. I did go through a crazy flaky period on my face/scalp/arms.  I finally used some tar shampoo and tea tree oil to get through that it lasted a good 8 to 10 weeks. My skin does feel much softer, my husband has commented several times. I think the most noticeable thing for me is the ITCH IS GONE.  That alone is worth the shots to me. I wish I had better luck with clearer skin. We don't realize how much we scratch ourselves without even thinking, until we stop.",CCHRanch

I notice a difference in the texture of my eczema, but I SWEAR I get a new patch everyday. I now have it on my sides, stomach, and hands. Places I have NEVER had it before.

Treatments I've previously used were cortisone creams (Diprolene & Clobetasol), antihistamines, regular application of emollients, anti itch creams, bleach baths. All just reduced flare ups but nothing ever made my eczema truly better. It has always been present even when most allergens were not present (i.e., in the winter). Dupixent is supposed to take several months to work, but I noticed that my skin was clearing up 4 days after the initial loading dose. Since then my skin has continued to show improvement with dramatically reduced redness and progressively less itchiness.",Calvin & Hobbes
