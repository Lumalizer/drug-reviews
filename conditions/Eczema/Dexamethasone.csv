0,Dexamethasone,Eczema,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"February 26, 2021",6,"Was prescribed ten 4 mg dexamethasone tablets to be taken twice daily as part of treatment for a tooth infection. Only took 5, and an eczema outbreak on the back of my neck I'd had for at least 3 years completely resolved. Now taking the last 5 I had saved months later in hopes of clearing a new outbreak of discoid eczema on the front of my neck which has already been there in excess of 2 weeks. If it works again I'll review again since discoid eczema is considered one of the more stubborn types and I'm unsure what type I had on the back of my neck previously.",Ali
1,Dexamethasone,Eczema,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"September 10, 2018",3,"I was admitted for a nasal surgery, but the doctor gave me dexamethasone 0.5mg to prevent allergies. My eczema disappeared & I feel better. I did some  research on this prescription, it is a kind of steroid & you cannot take it usually or daily. Better to consult with a doctor. But I would love to take it if I have better information & with doctor consultation.",neo
