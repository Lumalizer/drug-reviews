3,Ultravate,Eczema,10,,"April 11, 2008",32,This ointment was the only thing that worked for my eczema.  I had it on my leg for years and it was open and raw; the itch unbearable.  I tried everything and this was the only thing that made it go away.  10 years later and it has not come back.,Anonymous
