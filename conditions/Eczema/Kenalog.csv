0,Kenalog,Eczema,2,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"March 7, 2022",0,"I received no more than 3 Kenalog 10 injections in 2 years to help with eczema flare ups. 2 years after my last injection, my tissue and muscle showed wasting at the injection site. Since this site was my glute it was incredibly painful to sit and contributed to other pains and aches due to overcompensation. I had to receive Platelet Rich Plasma treatment to rejuvenate tissue and muscle growth in the area. Proceed with caution.",JM on a Monday
1,Kenalog,Eczema,10,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"April 25, 2021",2,I've had eczema with blisters only on my hands for over 15 years and I'm now 74. Kenalog injections is only med that clears up the skin of peeling itching burning in days. My dermatologist tried various types of creams with little relief over the years. He indicated season chances plus stress is probably the main cause of my flare up every 6 to 8 months. He indicated there is no known cure. He indicated several of his patients get regular kenalog injections for similar conditions.,Hutty
