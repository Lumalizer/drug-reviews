0,Hydrocortisone topical,Eczema,7,Taken for 10 years or more,"April 15, 2018",8,"This medicine is good and bad to it. It will treat almost all sorts of eczema, skin allergies, psoriasis etc. The thing to note is that this medicine SHOULDN'T be used long term. If you use it over time your skin can thin. It might take 20 years but it could happen. You could also develop red skin syndrome. My advice is use it for when you need it and on areas that are not noticeable. I wouldn't use it on the face.",Brad
1,Hydrocortisone topical,Eczema,8,,"January 16, 2018",16,"Cortizone-10 (hydrocortisone):This is my preventative cream. I put this on problem areas daily: under the boobs, under the fat folds, between the ""cheeks""... to prevent chafing and/or yeast infections that are provoked by sweat in the crevices. It is also my go-to for eczema outbreaks because it will usually ""nip it in the bud"" if I am diligent about applying it. AND, if I use it on my legs after shaving them, it will help prevent a lot of the itching that occurs whenever my legs are touched in any way.May I just say, ""I really hate eczema"".",KristenHdz
2,Hydrocortisone topical,Eczema,10,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"March 27, 2016",18,Cortizone-10 (hydrocortisone):I have always had eczema since a child and have tried different medications but none like this one. It is amazing!,Anonymous
3,Hydrocortisone topical,Eczema,10,Taken for less than 1 month,"November 27, 2015",14,"I wanted to take the time to provide you people with the knowledge about this stuff. I had small bumps (color was regular, white then pink it varies) all over my body. An area under my belly button, my arms, under my armpits, on my back, it was chaotic. When I used this stuff 2 days ago, I used half of the tube of it and I thought I seen results. Last night I used it again and I tell you that they are all just about gone. I had a horrible case on my neck, it is almost gone. So if you want to try something out, try this. I really hope that you get what you need and that it was from what I knew. I want what I went through to be of good reason, so it can help you when you go through it. Please, try hydrocortizone.",Antonioking4726754456
4,Hydrocortisone topical,Eczema,7,,"November 15, 2015",4,I have been using this cream and also at the same time hydromol ointment. I use the ointment first and then 20mins later then I use the hydrocortisone. Tbh for short term effects it's amazing but for the long term effects it doesn't work as well. It's been 3 months and it's made my long term effects a little better. Can anyone tell how to stop my skin being dry so I wouldn't have to use the creams ever in the future. Thanks,MSI_88888

Rashes changed positions and were very itchy. She was later diagnosed with Eczema.HydroVal worked right away, I applied it twice daily directly on the rashes. Her skin cleared after one week. There were no side effects at all.",Anonymous

9,Hydrocortisone topical,Eczema,10,,"March 16, 2010",16,"This product has been a miracle drug for my 1 yr old.  Horrible Eczema...have refused to use this medicine previously, prescribed by doctor, instead trying natural remedies.  Finally, I gave up, after about 9 months of trying to fight it naturally...after three applications of hydrocortisone 2.5%, his skin is COMPLETELY normal looking...again, COMPLETELY normal looking.  I still HATE to use this on him, but I'm hoping it will be short-term as I find out the underlying cause.  This product did in 1.5 days, what I haven't been able to do with natural remedies for 9 months.  I feel defeated, but at the same time grateful that my son can now sleep through the night.",Anonymous
