0,Lidex,Eczema,10,Taken for less than 1 month,"March 3, 2019",8,"This medication worked like nothing I've ever used before. It took a little over two weeks of treatment every night to make a rash that I'd had for two years disappear. I was warned that if I don't use it sparingly, I will experience a burning sensation, and I would recommend the same care to anyone else using it.",Filipino Francophile
