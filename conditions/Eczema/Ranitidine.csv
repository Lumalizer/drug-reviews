0,Ranitidine,Eczema,3,Taken for 5 to 10 years,"December 27, 2015",9,"Rash was very, very small bumps, some slightly visible but more so you could feel them more than see them. Itching is awful, it feels like ants crawling under my skin. This was after using this medication for a week. I had never used it before. It seemed to work somewhat but just taking it for a week wasn't really long enough to give a true report concerning how effective it was.",rash over entire body
1,Ranitidine,Eczema,10,Taken for less than 1 month,"June 22, 2012",55,Zantac (ranitidine):After 9 months of horrible psychotic-type itching I finally was able to see a dermatologist who I believe has correctly identified the cause.  He believes I have eczema.  The stress level following a whole spine surgery probably caused the condition to surface and begin its damage.  I started taking Benadryl on my own and it helped a lot.  When he added the H2 blocker (Zantac) it has all but disappeared.  Wonderful!  Thank you so much!,Michael Lynne
