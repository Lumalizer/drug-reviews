It was a vicious cycle that lasted for approximately 3 years.  Before this I only had mild ezcema, which I had for 15 years, treated with cortizone creams.  Imuran was prescribed by an allergist and immunoligist.  At first I took it with cortizone tablets and then after about 2 - 3 months I was only taking Imuran.  I have never felt better.  I only have a problem with my eyelids now, but this I can handle.  I have been on Imuran now for just over a year and fortunately have had very few side effects. ",Anonymous
