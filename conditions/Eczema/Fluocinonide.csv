0,Fluocinonide,Eczema,10.0,Taken for 10 years or more,"November 15, 2021",0,"I’ve been using this since 2011 and have had a lot of luck with it.  If I use it at the onset of symptoms, it is incredibly efficient and controlling my itchy patches.  It doesn’t take much product to treat either.  I have found that it’s too strong for me to use daily because my eczema isn’t that severe, so I typically put it on, it’s gone in the next day or two and I don’t have an issue in that same spot for a while.  Overall, I’ve been very happy with it!  The 120g size was $600 so ask your dermatologist for a coupon!  Mine had one that covered the cost completely.",DeeDee

3,Fluocinonide,Eczema,10.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"September 27, 2019",10,"This cream saved my life.  I've had eczema since I was a child & used Triamcinolone cream.  It was the worst when I was a child & teenager, but practically went away when I became an adult.  BUT, when I turned 45 yrs. old (pre-menopause), it spread over my entire body; my triamcinolone cream no longer worked.  That began a 7 yr. odyssey of literally trying everything.  At one point I wanted to die when I lay on my bed covered from head to toe in Crisco.  I had eczema on 98% of my body; my feet were spared.  I felt like a monster, even some of my hair falling out.  The only thing that worked to where I could function was Aquaphor + Apple Cider Vinegar, but I always wore hats & covered my body from head to toe.  Finally, when I went through complete menopause at 51 yrs. old, my doctors suggested I try fluocinonide.  I was hesistant at first because I had been steroid-free for 6 yrs., but decided to give it a try, and it worked!  Thank you, God!  I finally feel human again.",buzzy
4,Fluocinonide,Eczema,10.0,,"August 22, 2019",9,"I have been using this cream for 30 years.  It is a miracle cream.  At the slightest onset of an eczema breakout, I put this on and it is healed in a day or two.  Just amazing.",Skiff
5,Fluocinonide,Eczema,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"April 24, 2019",7,"Wonderful cream to apply sparingly, as the other commenters stated. I had a rash on my left elbow, so that I itched liked a dog with fleas :+\ , but this cream worked like a lucky charm-rash cleared- after only one week, upon the advice of using by the physician's assistant. Full 10 out of 10  rating!",JoannieO
6,Fluocinonide,Eczema,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"March 3, 2019",8,"Lidex (fluocinonide):This medication worked like nothing I've ever used before. It took a little over two weeks of treatment every night to make a rash that I'd had for two years disappear. I was warned that if I don't use it sparingly, I will experience a burning sensation, and I would recommend the same care to anyone else using it.",Filipino Francophile
7,Fluocinonide,Eczema,,,"October 5, 2018",9,"I don't like taking anything internal and this topical cream works amazing! I would get severe eczema on my fingers and legs and unable to touch a lot of things, this works to sooth the cracked and open skin overnight. Not sure if that's only with me, but I would use (sparingly) they way you would apply hand cream. It's my go to!",Mickeyob
