0,Halobetasol Topical,Eczema,10,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"September 9, 2017",2,"During my divorce, the skin on both feet literally peeled off. I would have to soak both feet so the dried blood would release my socks! Finally, a dermatologist took one look, asked if I was in stress, and told me I had eczema! He gave me a prescription for temovate , which later named ultravate. In less than 48 hrs, I had new skin on both feet! It literally saved my life!",Anonymous
