They took about four months to go away completely",Rose Paramount
1,Methotrexate,Eczema,10,,"February 3, 2021",6,"I have had severe eczema since I was 16 went through many different treatments and still do. From steroid creams, prednisone, dupixent, hyrdroxizine, and doxepin only steroid creams have worked however hydroxizine and doxepin have helped me sleep at night. When I thought all was lost because dupixent was  ineffective for me. My doctor offered methotrexate I have been on methotrexate for about 20 weeks now the first 8 or so weeks I thought it was not working but around week 10 my skin started getting very clear no more scaling and cracking and major peeling in general it has made my skin 100 times better. I have dry skin and redness in certain areas but apply  a steroid cream triamincinolne and it helps with the skin irritation when it flares up. Methotrexate has been very good for me in general. Many are afraid to take methotrexate because it is a chemo drug and has potentially severe side effects. Dupixent definitely is the thing to try first due to potential side effects of mtx",Samuel
2,Methotrexate,Eczema,5,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"January 15, 2021",7,Worked for my skin really well unfortunately had to stop because it was making my hair brittle and thinner  it was falling out to much for me to continue taking the medication.,Anonymous
3,Methotrexate,Eczema,9,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"July 23, 2020",22,"Methotrexate stopped my rashes.  I itched, scratched and bled. I was diagnosed with acute eczema --atopic dermatitis--immune disorder.  Because the problem is the skin making too many skin cells, the over-abundant new cells try to kick out the older healthy cells.  This makes you itch.  My itch was uncontrollable with topicals and creams.  Methotrexate works by destroying the work of folic acid (needed to build healthy cells). You need to know that a few people may develop lung webbing from methotrexate. You may feel a bit more tired and have more strange BMs a day or two after dosing.  It worked for me and is generic and inexpensive.  All drugs have side effects",Scratched the itch
4,Methotrexate,Eczema,8,,"February 22, 2013",73,"After suffering from about 5 years old, I'm now 56. Only been on the medication for approx 9 weeks the improvement has been amazing. I've been unable to cope with the pain and spent many days in bed over the years so touch wood this medication will keep on working.",george b
