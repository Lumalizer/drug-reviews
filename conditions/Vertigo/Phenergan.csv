3,Phenergan,Vertigo,3,,"June 24, 2010",25,"I have Meniere's - Phenergan seemed to help for about 2 hours, followed by a urge to throw up, and a horrible headache... also had to unscrew the fluourescent bulbs above desk at work, just felt like a rollercoaster - I felt better when I was moving, but when I stopped I was still moving!  ENT switched me to 1mg Ativan which worked (finally!), but it made me sleepy till I got used to it.",Anonymous
