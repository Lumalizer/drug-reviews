Did the manoeuvres to try and fix it and it did. But to my surprise it got 100 times worse in the morning, I couldn't get out of bed all day, and when I tried to eat or use the bathroom I'd just throw up. I got meclizine and tried it. Felt drowsy for most of the day but it definitely helped. A month goes by and I don't experience vertigo but it happened again a few days ago. I had a few pills left of meclizine from last time so I took it and it worked wonders. I took it a few hours ago because it was getting bad again and now I feel like a human again.

Finally on Sunday I went to make sure I had something to eat and coffee made for football. I checked the guide and it was still Saturday.

We are in the process of figuring out exactly why. I started my first dose last night and felt very strange falling asleep , as though my tongue was thicker/heavier than normal but was breathing fine and kinda passed out . Anyway I get up today fine with no dizziness but I was so cold I was shivering . I have lower than average blood pressure and I also take a muscle relaxer at night for spasms so I attributed it.  The new med added to my low blood pressure further . Got up and had breakfast , and then immediately felt weird and extremely tired like I need to lie down . So that’s where I am now . The whole point of this was to make me not feel like I had to lie down from dizziness and being lightheaded ! Lol. I feel light headed now though and just very fatigued , so I can't say I’m impressed with this as a solution . Back to the drawing board.",Jen

31,Meclizine,Vertigo,8.0,,"August 23, 2019",11,"I recently got a bad case of vertigo due to neglected calcification in my inner left ear. I've always had ear problems since I was a young child (getting swimmers ear, trauma to my ear drum from pebbles being forced in there, etc.). So I got this prescription because of that. The first two days, I had a horrible time. I got severe RLS (restless leg syndrome) and could not sleep at all. I found out this was due to the anti-histamine factors of the Meclizine. I absolutely DO NOT recommend taking Meclizine after 3pm if you are sensitive to anti-histamines and are prone to RLS like I am. I started taking my 3 doses of 25mg only in the morning/early afternoon time and it has worked perfectly. I'm kind of a small person so any dose later in the day will keep me up all night.

I am not sure if maybe the dose should be weight-dependent (from what people have said).I did not feel significantly less dizzy either.The most helpful thing that I have been doing are the Brandt Daroff exercises and vestibular rehabilitation exercises to get my eyes to work properly again.

Still feeling a little off balance and dizzy, but at least the room isn't spinning and I don't have the falling sensation.  Went to the doctor today to run some tests, but since I started the Bonine yesterday, the tests were inconclusive, since they couldn't trigger the vertigo.  Looks like this medicine works.  I am sleepy though, but am still having trouble sleeping, guess it's just being anxious that it might happen again.  Also, reading/typing triggers more dizziness.  Doctor said to continue on the meclizine for 2 weeks and it should take care of itself.  If not, to return to him, for further testing.",Anonymous
