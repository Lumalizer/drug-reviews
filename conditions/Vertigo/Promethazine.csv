2,Promethazine,Vertigo,10.0,,"June 10, 2016",18,I take this medication with another pill for my Ménière's Disease. Once my vertigo is in play I get severely nauseated and vomit. With this drug once an attack comes on I take it immediately. It not only calms me down but makes the nausea go away almost completely it's a God send.,Vertigosucks
3,Promethazine,Vertigo,3.0,Taken for 10 years or more,"October 26, 2013",12,"The pill version does nothing for vertigo. In my opinion, it appears to make me feel more unbalanced and dizzy than without. The syrup form does provide some help when it comes to treating vertigo. But, it its effects aren't long lasting either.The suppository form does provide some help towards helping treat vertigo. For severe cases of vertigo, phenergan alone is not the best solution for such. I would only recommend using it if your vertigo is not severe.",Reservechic

6,Promethazine,Vertigo,3.0,,"June 24, 2010",25,"Phenergan (promethazine):I have Meniere's - Phenergan seemed to help for about 2 hours, followed by a urge to throw up, and a horrible headache... also had to unscrew the fluourescent bulbs above desk at work, just felt like a rollercoaster - I felt better when I was moving, but when I stopped I was still moving!  ENT switched me to 1mg Ativan which worked (finally!), but it made me sleepy till I got used to it.",Anonymous
