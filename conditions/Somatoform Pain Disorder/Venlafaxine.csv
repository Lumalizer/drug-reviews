0,Venlafaxine,Somatoform Pain Disorder,7.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"August 26, 2021",1,Given Venalfaxine for depression due to low back pain and two spinal fusions over thirty years.  For depression and pain it was brilliant went from 130mg morphine equivalent a day to no pain meds at all!  The bad news was I had to stop it after 3 weeks due to an allergic reaction which recovered after I stopped taking it.  However the pain returned and had to go back on the fentanyl.  Now trying Duloxetine which appears to be not so good for either pain /depression.,Bazer_20002000
