3,Naproxen,Muscle Pain,2.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"August 1, 2020",10,After stopping this medication naproxen  I began experiencing muscle and joint pain. At times I could hardly move without terrible pain. Especially the top of my shoulders muscles and my upper arms. The back of my upper legs are so stiff it takes a moment to get up and start moving. My hands and fingers become so stiff to the point of little use of them. I explained this to my doctor and her response was to give me another medication. This time for arthritis. Pill pusher never mind my symptoms.,Terry

8,Naproxen,Muscle Pain,,Taken for less than 1 month,"January 7, 2018",11,"Pharmacist offered this for joint/muscle pain, related to unknown condition (possibly beginning of rheumatoid or reactive arthritis).  After I took 220mg, it made me calm, painless, but I also felt kind of isolated, and deeply depressed. An irrational feeling of untouchable, undefinable empty sadness. I felt very bad, could not stop the whole experience. I was happy it was the end of the day and so I went to bed. The painkiller effect and anti inflammatory effect was however very effective. It erased all my pain in my muscles. But be careful, if you are sensitive. I did not have suicidal thoughts, but I was close to it! I felt if I would watch a very sad documentary about all the bad things humans did.",Karlitos
9,Naproxen,Muscle Pain,10.0,,"February 26, 2017",11,"Previous had this prescribed to me for Back Pain several year ago. 500mg twice a day and it certainly used to take the edge off the pain. Of course it won't eradicate the pain, it's only a mild NSAID not an opioid. Recently been using 500mg per day for a week for calf strain from running injury. Really helped in the first 48hrs. It seem there's a few comments on here regarding allergic reactions. Allergies to aspirin and other NSAID are common. If you are not allergic, then I recommend Naproxin as a starting point.",AlanUK

13,Naproxen,Muscle Pain,7.0,,"January 20, 2016",26,"I have a torn shoulder tendon (rotator cuff injury) which has been causing me agonising pain 24/7 for 6 months. Ibuprofen wasn't working so I was given Naproxen. It takes quite a while to get to work (up to an hour to kick in) but once it works the relief is amazing. Only thing is, once it wears off (about 4-6 hours), the pain returns big time, and you're not supposed to use more than 2 tablets a day. Also, it made me ravenously hungry at the start (not so much now) so I've added a couple of Kg in weight. When it doesn't work well I take some Paracetamol (Acetaminophen) as well. Doesn't do anything for my headaches though and may even cause them.",JibloNoir

15,Naproxen,Muscle Pain,3.0,,"August 8, 2015",13,I pulled a muscle in my back on a Saturday. The pain was intense. Sleepless nights because of the pain. I started taking paracetamol and ibuprofen which did help during the day time. But once you have a sleep waking up was painful.Saw a doctor today. Now Friday. They told me to get naproxen 500mg. Take 1 twice a day. Took one as soon as I got home. Seem to work. Put still had the pain. Slightly. Took 1 before bed time.  Only to awake in pain.

23,Naproxen,Muscle Pain,5.0,,"May 3, 2014",10,"375 mg, three times a day was prescribed for my severe muscle pull near the left hip. Took the first pill at dinner time Thursday. Pain subsided a bit, but the medicine apparently wears off after 8 hours, because pain woke me up at 4:15 am Friday. Took pills at 4:30 am, 12 noon and again 8 pm.  Would estimate the pain was 1/3 less during the day. Sleep was again interrupted by hip pain: there was no positioning of the knees or legs that lessened the pain.  Today, Saturday, I took a pill at 7 am and will continue to dose every 8 hours.  Tomorrow I have to perform a concert while standing, so I'm counting on these to pull me through.   Eager to get off these pills because of their scary effect on blood pressure.",UFO Bass

30,Naproxen,Muscle Pain,8.0,,"June 27, 2008",28,I use this for lower back and hip pain. It works very well on the sciatic pain I get from injury to my back and hip. the only other drug that helps is at least 800mg of motrin. Naproxen works for about 7 hours while motrin only lasts 3-4 hours. I think these basically relieve swelling pressure on the nerve column.,flashburn97
31,Naproxen,Muscle Pain,8.0,,"May 12, 2008",39,"I used Naproxen when I tore a tendon in my knee and the swelling would not go down. Naproxen works. It takes some time but you have to be on a regular dose and once you stop taking it, it goes back to the way it was before (at least in my case it did).",Anonymous
