0,Tylenol,Muscle Pain,1,Taken for less than 1 month,"August 2, 2021",0,"The Tylenol bottles are way to hard to open for someone with arthritis in the hands. It's bad enough that you need to turn the cap to lineup the arrows but then you need to pry up the cap with only the small arrow to push on - there should be an easier way to open the cap. Tylenol cold even include a non-safety cap on the box. Pharmacy's provide non-safety caps and Tylenol could should also. Until they figure it out, I will not purchase another Tylenol package!",Sandy
