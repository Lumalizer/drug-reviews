0,Diclofenac,Muscle Pain,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"December 13, 2021",2,"In the past when having problems with pain whether it be back or muscle pain I was always prescribed diclofenac and it always worked well at least within half an hour.  I could feel it working and to my knowledge I never had any of the side effects of what I have read but that's just me maybe. I've just been lucky, when I have pain that is the one medicine I always go for.",Anonymous

2,Diclofenac,Muscle Pain,1.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"May 4, 2021",3,My doctor wanted to switch me on to this medication instead of taking ibuprofen 800. I took this medicine for severe body pain and it did absolutely nothing.  I would not recommend this medication at all. It seems its warnings are far greater than its actually use.,Bets
3,Diclofenac,Muscle Pain,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"March 24, 2021",0,"I fell and landed on my rear end and somehow managed to twist some muscles in my side and back. Because I take a blood thinner, I could not take Motrin which would have been my go to. My physician suggested diclofenac sodium 1% gel. Maybe it was because of how deep my muscle injury was, but this gel didn't do squat. It didn't help me at all. For something that you can only use twice a day, I had hoped for better results.",Gramma
4,Diclofenac,Muscle Pain,2.0,,"February 1, 2021",1,Took 2 diclofenac several hours apart on Thursday and Friday.  Friday night noticed I had abdominal bloating and right side pain. Felt sick to my stomach to even drink water. Very bad headache as well. Thought maybe it was my appendix or something intestinal. Headache still persisted on Saturday so I took another one. Literally thought my stomach was going to explode. This is the only new medication I am taking so narrowed it down to this being a side effect from the diclofenac.  Will not be taking it again.,Anonymous

9,Diclofenac,Muscle Pain,,Taken for less than 1 month,"February 3, 2018",4,"It helps a lot with pain, but it kills me more to take it because of the constant diarrhea it gives you is completely terrible. And on top of that when you vomit it's ever worse. Why would a doctor even prescribe these? I don't know but I can't get through the whole prescription.",Javrius Fleming

Voltaren actually reduces to Rids muscle and all other pain in my miserable body. I can't take narcotics as i vomit and they don't work, but oddly Voltaren does work for me. Also works on those with arthritis  (as originally intended) and several people have commented this cream/gel has been the only med, oral or topical, to truly help.I use Brand as generics of anything don't work.",Fullbodypain
12,Diclofenac,Muscle Pain,,,"October 12, 2017",13,Cataflam (diclofenac):I was misled by a person working in the pharmacy I visited and asked if cataflam is an NSAID as I am allergic to these medications. I was shown that it does not say so on the package. One Cataflam taken caused my eyes to itch and swell within 2 hours. It was only then I had the good sense to check online for myself to see that it was.,Caribbean man

Forked out the $$ to see my doc, & he prescribed diclofenic sodium TBEC 75 mg. Overnight relief!  Second day, feels almost healed!!!  The only reason I didn't give it a 10 is because I have to eat a really good size meal to avoid nausea, & of course I need to lose some weight. But otherwise, bless you,  Doc!!",Gayle D.

19,Diclofenac,Muscle Pain,10.0,,"January 17, 2013",29,"I was prescribed Diclofenac 75 mg, for chest pain. It did nothing for me. I think my chest pain was due to anxiety and indigestion, so I stopped taking it after 1 day. A year later I woke up one morning with a stiff neck. I thought nothing of it and went to a trampoline park where I came down with a thud on my bum. No biggie, I'm pretty resilient at 32. The next day I had excruciating pain in my upper left back, neck and shoulder. My muscle at the collar bone was cramped tight! I waited 2 weeks and there was little relief, no sleep. I found my Diclofenac and it helped in an hour! NO PAIN! I slept for a full night! I see doc tomorrow for an MRI and diagnosis.",Lexface2003

The MD this morning said to get blood work done for auto-immune checks and an OV with the surgeon.  He then gave me 4 days of Zipsor 4 per day, and after this morning's tablet, it helped with the pain.  Now at 4:30PM, it is time for tablet #2.  Good Results - Thanks!",archjen

23,Diclofenac,Muscle Pain,2.0,,"October 13, 2009",14,Was prescribed Diclofenac Sod 75 mg for hip pain from a pulled muscle. First dosage caused me itches (I have had a slight reaction to Naproxen Sodium also) so was not too worried. I don't really see much reduction of pain and it appears a larger dose would give me hives.Many years ago I had tremendous shoulder pain and was prescribed Baclofen. THAT drug helped me completely. I had no side effects (unsure of the dosage.Perhaps I'll ask if I can retry that drug in place of Diclofenac.,LavaRock

26,Diclofenac,Muscle Pain,8.0,,"November 2, 2008",97,Voltaren (diclofenac):I have a heel spur and was given Voltaren for inflammation to possibly control plantar fascitis. This along with a 10 day use of AFO brace on my foot just may help prevent surgery. I believe Voltaren definitely is doing the job in reducing inflammation and controlling the pain.,chelleinva
