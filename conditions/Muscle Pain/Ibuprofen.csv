1,Ibuprofen,Muscle Pain,8,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"December 15, 2019",4,Advil Liqui-Gels (ibuprofen):Advil works great for inflammation and pain but has anybody experience blood vessels breaking under the skin after long term use? If I scratch my arm over my clothes it will make a horrible spot. It only happens on my arms so weird.,Anonymous
2,Ibuprofen,Muscle Pain,5,Taken for less than 1 month,"March 2, 2018",12,I gave it 5 stars only because it really did help me with my pain from pleurisy. I take one 800mg tablet every 6 hours when it flares up. But with long term usage (sometimes my flare ups last two weeks) I have noticed that I have felt extreme depression. Almost to the point where I see no reason to continue on. I didn't realize it was the medicine until someone else shared their story of ibuprofen with me. It had also made them depressed. So I immediately stopped taking it and within a few days was back to my old self. So moral of the story is that if you need to take ibuprofen please make sure you are doing it under a doctors supervision. Depression is not fun especially when you are in pain.,Ibuprofen caused Depression
