0,Methotrexate,Gastric Cancer,1,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"March 6, 2016",5,"I have crohn's disease and started methotrexate in conjunction with my remicade treatments, as it was supposed to lessen the chance of developing antibodies to remicade.  The biggest effect this drug had on me was psychologically.  I became severely depressed (absolutely no history of depression), when I started have some suicidal thoughts I knew I had to stop it (took drug for just 3 months).  As soon as I stopped (but continued with remicade) all those symptoms stopped.  For me it was one of the scariest drugs I've ever been on and I wanted to put this here, while these side effects seem rare, this was definitely a side effect of taking methotrexate for me, and there may be others.",cw55
