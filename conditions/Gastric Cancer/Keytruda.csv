0,Keytruda,Gastric Cancer,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"September 24, 2021",4,"My uncle has stomach cancer and went thru chemotherapy. His cancer was under control and he was in remission.  He then started  to take keytruda @ $9500 every 3 weeks,  out of pocket and within 5 weeks he was dead.  The keytruda caused liver damage and shut his organs down.  DO NOT TAKE THIS DRUG!!!",DO NOT TAKE KEY
1,Keytruda,Gastric Cancer,,Taken for less than 1 month,"April 20, 2021",7,"I believe keytruda led to my father's death. He was living life with NET (neuroendocrine tumors) but after having just one injection on Tuesday, March 9th, 2021 he began to have side effects. By March 13th he had died. I believe this immunotherapy treatment triggered his untimely death.",ckap
2,Keytruda,Gastric Cancer,1.0,,"April 7, 2021",7,"Keytruda is what ended my fathers life.We were told nothing but wonderful things about Immunotherapy and how it would be less taxing on the body than Chemotherapy. He died less than 30 days after his first infusion.He was diagnosed with Stage 4 Stomach Cancer on October 17, 2020. He underwent Chemo treatments and they switched him to Immunotherapy/Keytruda in December. He endured a steep decline shortly after and died weeks later.Please, if you are considering Keytruda, do your due diligence and research the very probable side effects. I wish we had. We trusted his Oncologist 110% and really thought this would help him. Do not make the same mistake we did.",Anonymous
3,Keytruda,Gastric Cancer,1.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"November 14, 2020",9,"This medicine shortened my father's lifespan. In 2019, he was diagnosed with stage 4 gastric cancer that spread to his liver. After a few rounds of regular chemo, his cancer shrunk and he was feeling much better. Then, they switched his oncologists. His new oncologist said that he already took too many rounds of chemo, so they prescribed him to go on Keytruda. Few months into his treatment, he started feeling a lot weaker. After they did a CT scan, it revealed that his cancer has been spreading for a few months and started to spread around the same time he went on Keytruda. They still put him on another round of Keytruda. After that round of Keytruda, his skin started to get yellow and he started to feel weaker. After being admitted to ER, they said they could not do anything. The cancer has overtaken his liver. He died a few weeks later.Keytruda has not worked for him and might have contributed to his death by destroying his organs.",Joe
4,Keytruda,Gastric Cancer,1.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"March 22, 2019",22,"My husband had stage 4 esophageal cancer and we were so excited to be a candidate for this wonderful thing called immunotherapy. All the good of it is shared, but the fact that patients die right after starting Keytruda is not being discussed everywhere. His health declined immediately after starting it and passed away after 2nd treatment. He was doing so well and working daily up until he started the Immunotherapy. I regret ever that we chose to believe nothing but great things about it.",Broken
