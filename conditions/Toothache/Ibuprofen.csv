0,Ibuprofen,Toothache,2.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"September 18, 2021",1,"For a tooth ache, 800mg does not help. The pain continues and will be seeking a dentist.",Strong Grave
1,Ibuprofen,Toothache,9.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"August 10, 2021",1,"I recently started experiencing a constant toothache from one of the wisdom teeth that had yet to be pulled. Of course, this happened when I was on vacation and I couldn't get in to see my dentist for almost a month (knowing in all likelihood t would have to be pulled). I used 600mg of name brand Advil (coated) up to every 6 hours and it worked consistently. The pain wasn't completely gone, but it was almost unnoticeable. I also had consistent results with 200mg Advil Liqui-gels and 200mg Walgreens Capsules. I did not have any luck using Target branded coated tablets. Happy to say I was finally able to get my problematic tooth pulled. They prescribed an 800mg tablet every 8 hours. So far so good.",Anonymous
2,Ibuprofen,Toothache,2.0,,"March 27, 2021",33,"It ONLY WORKS if you stay ahead of the pain. I've had 2 different lower jaw teeth removed at different periods in my life and the pain was tooooo much for 800mg Ibuprofen. Both times I felt like a junkie begging for drugs from my dentist. Really?! You just dug around in my jawbone for 25 minutes and obliterated the soft tissues of my gum and want to treat me like a drug seeker when this Ibuprofen isn't cutting it? It absolutely confuses me how so many people have access to all of these pain killers but when you actually have a procedure that is likely to have massive pain you have to beg, use Ibuprofen, or suffer terrible pain OR take dangerous amounts of OTC concoctions hoping for relief.  Stop doing this to people.",Ozarkmom
3,Ibuprofen,Toothache,8.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"December 15, 2020",6,Advil Liqui-Gels (ibuprofen):I took Advil and its the only pain med I am able too. So I'm in in between a rock and a hard place. Because I know why my tooth hurts its swollen I got major gum issues,Katt

6,Ibuprofen,Toothache,2.0,,"July 16, 2019",21,A lot off people such as myself haven been to the Dentist get a wisdom tooth pulled and I'm looking for something to reduce/stop the pain and ibuprofen SUCKS like I never even took anything... The pain swallows the pill.,D
7,Ibuprofen,Toothache,9.0,,"June 13, 2019",20,Advil Liqui-Gels (ibuprofen):Been there done that. I've tried everything there is to offer for tooth pain with zero results. I have a huge hole in a lower wisdom tooth as we speak. When waiting to get in to the poor man's dentist it can take a month or more. (Based on income) I have 2 more weeks and I am counting down the minutes. ,Lathalweapon
8,Ibuprofen,Toothache,,Taken for less than 1 month,"May 11, 2019",16,I had my wisdom teeth out and was in agonizing pain. I took a 600mg tablet of ibuprofen with 1 extra strength tylenol as they instructed and it got me through it. Highly recommend. Just don't overdo it.,Riri

10,Ibuprofen,Toothache,9.0,Taken for 5 to 10 years,"March 29, 2018",31,"Advil Liqui-Gels (ibuprofen):I dont know why the rating for this medication is so low , unless it is because people just haven't tried it in which case I would highly recommend doing so. These are my go-to , the liquid medicine means it works faster and though you can't cure tooth pain fast enough , I can always count on these taking the edge off ..I don't bother taking anything else !",shannon
11,Ibuprofen,Toothache,10.0,,"November 14, 2017",15,"Had it recommended by the chemist rather than codeineI didn't think anything worked for a toothache but ibuprofen worked for me 2 tabs for start then 1 when it wares off about 6 hours, while waiting for the dentist appointment.",hazchem
12,Ibuprofen,Toothache,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"July 2, 2017",28,"This drug works wonders. I got all 4 wisdom teeth extracted two days ago and on the first night I had no pain but the second night at around 4:00 am I started getting the worst pain I've ever felt that kept me from sleeping. The first thing I thought of was ibuprofen. I quickly went downstairs to get some. I'm 5'3"" and 120 lbs, I took four 200 mg pills as prescribed. It took less than 30 mins to kick in and once it did I felt no pain at all and fell asleep perfectly fine and comfortable. Thankyou very much Stewart Adams for inventing this drug. It's simple but miraculous. Sincerely, Sarah Craig",Sarah Craig
