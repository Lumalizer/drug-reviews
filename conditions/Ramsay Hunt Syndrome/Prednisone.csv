0,Prednisone,Ramsay Hunt Syndrome,10,,"May 17, 2021",1,"Following a lung surgery at 19,  a hysterectomy at 27, my body's joints swelled up overnight. The second time, in addition to swollen joints, my tendons were inflamed where they attach to the bones.  After testing, the doctor diagnosed me with crippling RA headed for a wheelchair with an RA factor over 600.  I was on 60mg per day of prednisone for the next month.  The swelling and stiffness became controlled. I took 800mg of ibuprofen per day for the next 40 years with taking 20mg  prednisone at times to control flares. I refused methatrexate and other biologicals.  After suffering terribly for the last two years following a bad flare, I am back on 20mg of prednisone per day for awhile.  I can almost function normally with minimal pain.  I will be 75 next month.  Prednisone has been my miracle  drug for the last 50 years.  Any amount less than that does me no good.  This time I have only been on 20mg prednisone for 7 days so far.  I have been on 5mg or 10mg per day for the last 2 years",MJ75
