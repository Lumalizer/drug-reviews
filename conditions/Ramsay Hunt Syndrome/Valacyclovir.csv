0,Valacyclovir,Ramsay Hunt Syndrome,8,Taken for 5 to 10 years,"December 2, 2013",4,I've had great success with this medicine. I'm taking 500 mg per day. I've had a few bad incidents when my immune system  was low and I forgot to take Meds a couple of days.  I got the flu and had herpetic  seizures in my face. Another time in my left ear.  Both reactions were horrible with extreme pain and vertigo. Get on the medicine and stay on it for the least symptoms.,Tkhummer
