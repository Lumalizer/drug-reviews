0,Warfarin,Pulmonary Embolism First Event,10.0,Taken for 5 to 10 years,"June 4, 2019",11,"Have been on warfarin for about 10 years now ever since being in a coma for 2 weeks on life support on the verge of death from 3 blood clots in my left lung. I don't remember being told if I had had a stroke or not, but upon coming out of the coma, my hands, arms, and, legs were paralyzed and upon being medically stabilized was sent to rehab to regain the use of my limbs. Warfarin has its drawbacks of constant monitoring, but it has served me well, and though there are newer anticoagulants on the market that they say don't require the testing, I just would not trust them to be consistent with the job they were supposed to be doing, so I would rather stay on warfarin with the testing for a monitoring process. That's just the way I see it. If it ain't broke, don't fix it!",Shortbread 53
