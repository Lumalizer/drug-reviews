1,Hydroxychloroquine,Sjogren's Syndrome,,,"December 22, 2021",1,It has been recommended to me but I feel that all the possible side effects are something that I already experience.

2,Hydroxychloroquine,Sjogren's Syndrome,9.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"November 6, 2021",0,"I've been on hydroxychloroquine for just over 10 weeks, for pain and stiffness related to Sjogrens, hEDS and  arthritis.For the first few weeks I didn't notice anything and thought it wasn't going to do anything - then one day I suddenly realised I'd walked up the stairs from my local train station to the outside without having to stop and rest! There's only about 13 steps but usually I dread going up them, and would usually take a detour of almost 30 minutes to avoid them, but this time I just didn't think before heading up them. I've even managed to reduce/come off other medication because it's worked so well!Is it perfect? No - not only does it taste awful (whyyyy? *lol*) but I still get pain/stiffness in the morning, especially as we're going into the colder months. And I have to take my doses morning and lunchtime as if I take it too late I can't get to sleep (does anyone else get this?)

My rheumy told me I could not stop this med & that it wouldn't cause this problem & I need to stop doing research on the internet. So I cut my dose in half, after 6 months I was feeling better so I stopped the med completely.  I found a new rheumy who confirmed that these are side effects, though not as frequent as others.

I use Restasis 2x a day and Pilocarpine 2-3x a day. I still have joint pain just about everywhere, some severe. It didn't help the muscle/connective pain but I solved that with a year of frequent Acupuncture. My doc insisted I see the acupuncturist: in fact, he saw the same person for his knee pain.

But, I started getting bronchitis in Jan-April, took antibiotics, felt good for a week and then the next month it was back again. Dr. said stop plaquenill so your immune system can help you heal so when I stopped taking it I finally healed and haven't had bronchitis since so I decided I was not taking a drug that was not helping my sjogren's nor did I want to take a drug that slows down immune system to help me fight off whatever else.",CAVI
