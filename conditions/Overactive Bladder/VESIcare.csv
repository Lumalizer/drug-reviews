0,VESIcare,Overactive Bladder,2,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"August 24, 2021",0,"I tried it first when I was a teenager, it made my mouth dry as cotton to the point I almost lost my voice. Because of this I would drink more water and use the bathroom even more frequently than without it. Last year it was recommended to me to try again. It worked a tiny bit at first but started to taper off. Again it caused a lot of dry mouth, sometimes I was scared I would swallow my tongue lol. After not finding success I tried another med, also didn’t work very well. But due to finances I was told to go back onto VesiCare again until I could try other options. This time it made my frequency even worse than before. It also made my bladder feel extremely full very frequently, despite mostly emptying my bladder which was extremely bothersome and uncomfortable. I’m so very frustrated with not having any success on these medications.",Ooooooh6728
1,VESIcare,Overactive Bladder,8,Taken for 10 years or more,"December 1, 2020",4,"I had prostatectomy aged about 65, 17 years ago.It caused urine leak so doctor prescribed 10mg Vesicore daily.  I don’t remember any side effects and it was effective, but I still had to wear a small pad.I was happy and reduced the dose to 5mg which was almost as good.  I got it on the British health service with no cost to me.Now I am trapped abroad by COVID 19 and ran out of 5mg Vesicare.  I ordered genuine Vesicare online and while waiting for arrival I found in my travel luggage some of the very old 10mg which I discoverEd would last 2 or 3 days. Now my online Vesicare,  cost about US dollars each, have arrived and are proving very ineffective.  I will continue to hope for improvement and I will hope for better when I get back to England.I have checked the packet and information leaflet which seems genuine, although in a foreign language, possibly Persian. I have taken a double dose (2x 5mg) without improvement.",Ches
2,VESIcare,Overactive Bladder,9,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"September 6, 2020",18,"Been using 10mg vesicare for just over a year now. (Upped from 5mg after 5 months) BRILLIANT drug for me and my overactive bladder. Only noted side effect was a slightly dry mouth. But hey, no more pads or wee dances on the school run.  Been asked to take a 'drug holiday' by my GP and well..... it's been 10 days now, 7 of them with the worst headache ever. About a million pairs of clean knickers been needed and an unhappy ""hello again"" to the old friend Tena. Sat here writing a review just after midnight as needed to get up for a wee yet again.  Suppose I best get back into the habits of dehydrating before I go anywhere, never passing up the opportunity of a free toilet and say goodbye to those pretty knickers for a while.  Soooooo hoping I can go back on them soon.",Me xxx
