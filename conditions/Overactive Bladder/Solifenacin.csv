0,Solifenacin,Overactive Bladder,1.0,,"March 6, 2022",0,I took solifenacin for one month. Didn’t help me at all I stop it. No sides affect but not working.,Yamna el mourab
1,Solifenacin,Overactive Bladder,9.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"January 10, 2022",0,I have been on Solifenacin for about 4 years.It has been excellent for the first 3 years.I can go out with friends and don’t have to keep going to the toilet.I did have to go a couple of times at night but I didn’t mind as ok during the day.Recently I have had a different manufacturer every time I pick up my prescription and the tablets don’t always work as they should. This did happen a while ago and my doctor stated to only prescribe the tablets by Morningside.If I mention it to the pharmacist they say that there is no difference in the tablets. Has anyone else experienced this problem?I can put up with side effects but not the frequent changes to manufacturers.,Patsyd
2,Solifenacin,Overactive Bladder,10.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"December 14, 2021",0,"29 yrs old and had nasty UTIs around 5 years ago. Also had prolapses from difficult birth. But then UTIs were happening but no actual infection could be grown. Urethra would swell, spasm and bleed randomly. Sometimes unable to pee but pushing & straining needing to pee. Sex, baths, swimming, standing, tight clothes all trigger these flares. I’ve tried everything as have doctors. 6 weeks ago, my new private uro-gynae said to try Solifenacin as it could hopefully act as an antispasmodic for urethra and ease the flares. After 2 weeks, I noted no difference or side effects. 4 weeks, I realised I hadn’t had a major flare up. 6 weeks now and my urethra is doing really well. I’m still sore and uncomfortable but the flare ups that are horrific have eased. Issue is that the tummy pains, cramps & constipation has set in. I’m sat with a hot water bottle, buscopan trying to ease the cramps. I will continue and hope it eases as these meds could really change mine & my children’s lives!",Dizzzay
3,Solifenacin,Overactive Bladder,2.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"August 24, 2021",0,"VESIcare (solifenacin):I tried it first when I was a teenager, it made my mouth dry as cotton to the point I almost lost my voice. Because of this I would drink more water and use the bathroom even more frequently than without it. Last year it was recommended to me to try again. It worked a tiny bit at first but started to taper off. Again it caused a lot of dry mouth, sometimes I was scared I would swallow my tongue lol. After not finding success I tried another med, also didn’t work very well. But due to finances I was told to go back onto VesiCare again until I could try other options. This time it made my frequency even worse than before. It also made my bladder feel extremely full very frequently, despite mostly emptying my bladder which was extremely bothersome and uncomfortable. I’m so very frustrated with not having any success on these medications.",Ooooooh6728
4,Solifenacin,Overactive Bladder,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"August 10, 2021",0,Been on this for a little over a week for prostate issues.  No noticeable improvement.  No side effects yet.  Will update in 2 weeks.,James
5,Solifenacin,Overactive Bladder,,Taken for 10 years or more,"July 3, 2021",2,"I've suffered frequent visits to the toilet for years but it got so bad it was taking my life over I constantly needed to visit the toilet,I didn't leak but was constantly uncomfortable.  I took the drug Solifenacin and after several days I couldn't believe the difference I didn't have to worry when I went out Fantastic! Then after approx 2 months my ankles were so swollen I had to stop taking them.  I felt so disappointed but now I don't know why my bladder hasn't gone back to how it used to be even though its 10 days since I stopped taking them,very strange hope it lasts.",jodie
6,Solifenacin,Overactive Bladder,3.0,Taken for 5 to 10 years,"April 27, 2021",3,"For 5 years I was on Vesicare and it was great I had complete control. When I retired and had to switch to Solifenacin, the issues all came back. I would say 20% effective as Vesicare.",Ron
7,Solifenacin,Overactive Bladder,2.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"April 16, 2021",2,I was prescribed only 5mg. of solifenacin for my urinary problem.  I take it at night as it does make me sleepy. It is short acting and I still have to wear a pad during the day.  I also am having dry mouth (which is not a problem) and awful tremors.  Will stop this drug tonight!,none
8,Solifenacin,Overactive Bladder,2.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"March 16, 2021",1,"Decided to stop taking after 4 days because of significant drowsiness/tiredness. No effect on OAB during this time, but may have had if I had carried on taking. No drowsiness/tiredness now I have stopped taking medication.",Rohan
9,Solifenacin,Overactive Bladder,5.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"January 18, 2021",1,"I have been taking this for nearly a year for OAB. I switched from oxybutynin because Solifenacin is once daily and prefer to take meds as infrequently as possible. The oxybutynin also gave me concentration and memory problems with occasional diarrhoea. Apart from the dry mouth which is manageable, I haven't noticed any other side effects from solifenacin. It managed my symptoms OK but had better control with oxybutynin. All of a sudden after 9 months of taking Solifenacin my OAB symptoms have come back with a vengeance, not sure what happened but possibly think that I have built a tolerance to this medication and have restarted oxybutynin",M
10,Solifenacin,Overactive Bladder,8.0,Taken for 10 years or more,"December 1, 2020",4,"VESIcare (solifenacin):I had prostatectomy aged about 65, 17 years ago.It caused urine leak so doctor prescribed 10mg Vesicore daily.  I don’t remember any side effects and it was effective, but I still had to wear a small pad.I was happy and reduced the dose to 5mg which was almost as good.  I got it on the British health service with no cost to me.Now I am trapped abroad by COVID 19 and ran out of 5mg Vesicare.  I ordered genuine Vesicare online and while waiting for arrival I found in my travel luggage some of the very old 10mg which I discoverEd would last 2 or 3 days. Now my online Vesicare,  cost about US dollars each, have arrived and are proving very ineffective.  I will continue to hope for improvement and I will hope for better when I get back to England.I have checked the packet and information leaflet which seems genuine, although in a foreign language, possibly Persian. I have taken a double dose (2x 5mg) without improvement.",Ches
11,Solifenacin,Overactive Bladder,8.0,,"October 9, 2020",2,I've taken 10mg everyday for roughly 9 months now. I'm a healthy 25 year old other than my over active bladder. Before the medication I had accidents at least 4 times a day and rarely at night. After starting this my symptoms during the day were cut in half BUT now I have accidents every night. No other medication I've tried relieved my symptoms by this much but the wetting the bed once a night is better than 4 times everyday....odd but worth it in my opinion.,Liv
12,Solifenacin,Overactive Bladder,9.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"September 6, 2020",18,"VESIcare (solifenacin):Been using 10mg vesicare for just over a year now. (Upped from 5mg after 5 months) BRILLIANT drug for me and my overactive bladder. Only noted side effect was a slightly dry mouth. But hey, no more pads or wee dances on the school run.  Been asked to take a 'drug holiday' by my GP and well..... it's been 10 days now, 7 of them with the worst headache ever. About a million pairs of clean knickers been needed and an unhappy ""hello again"" to the old friend Tena. Sat here writing a review just after midnight as needed to get up for a wee yet again.  Suppose I best get back into the habits of dehydrating before I go anywhere, never passing up the opportunity of a free toilet and say goodbye to those pretty knickers for a while.  Soooooo hoping I can go back on them soon.",Me xxx
13,Solifenacin,Overactive Bladder,1.0,,"August 10, 2020",9,"I started Vesicare (generic-Solifenacin Succinate) three months ago for OAB.  At first the medication worked, 10 mg daily, with my urge incontinence, so I was pleased at the results.  After a week, I began to experience dry mouth, and constipation was a challenge, but I was also able to 'deal' with it due to the results from this medication, so I recognized that would be a trade off.  But when the lightheadedness started, on and off, that caused an additional problem that was far more challenging than dry mouth and constipation.  The dosage was dropped to 5mg on one day and 10mg on another, alternating.  The problem persisted and after three months, I found that this medication was not working to its full effect.    I called the doctor and stopped and after three days all side effects were gone-no more dry mouth, bathroom issues normal and lightheadedness GONE! This medication made me feel terrible!!  The side effects outweigh the benefits from this medication.",Janny
14,Solifenacin,Overactive Bladder,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"July 19, 2020",4,solifenacin is an awful drug. I took it for ten days and the  first day I had a dry mouth. It did help with frequency but on the second day I felt as if I was carrying a heavy suitcase on my shoulders. Then the nausea and stomach pains started .Worse after I ate  and then I lost all appetite. I thought the side effects might reduce but on the ninth day I just felt worse. Peeing all the time might be better. I am not sure if it was just this drug or a combination of all my other meds with it but I never felt like that before I took it.It does say that the side affect will wear off but I couldn't even work because of them so I decided to stop taking it. The horrible side affects last three days to get it totally out of my systems but I will never take it again. Sorry.,Torie
15,Solifenacin,Overactive Bladder,1.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"June 25, 2020",4,I had been taking brand name Vesicare for two years and then when a generic substitute came out my insurance (Medicare and AARP United healthcare)Would only pay for generic which I think is fair. Almost all of my drugs are generic except Myrbetriq another overactive bladder which is far superior to the generic vesicare. Solifenacin is weak and my overactive bladder acts up 6 hours later and I have sometimes taken another pill after dinner so I do not wake up at night to go to the bathroom 5 times. I would give it a zero out of 10,Linda
16,Solifenacin,Overactive Bladder,3.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"June 14, 2020",4,"Have OAB with major urgency issues & have tried almost all the meds.  Found one that works (Myrbetriq) but it's not covered by my insurance so I had to try Solifenacin 10mg since it is.  While the drug is very effective, the side effects are so massive, I had to stop after 3 days.  The half life is so long, that I'm still feeling most of the side effects days after I've stopped. Raspy voice, feeling like there is a 'fog' in my throat, shortness of breath, tingling in the hands & feet and excessively tired.  Between the extreme fatigue & the sore throat, I was thinking maybe I should get a COVID test, til I realized it was this medication.  What a disappointment, as this is one of the 2 most effective meds I've tried.",Zoe
