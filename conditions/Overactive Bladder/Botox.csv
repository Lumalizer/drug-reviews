0,Botox,Overactive Bladder,1.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"January 24, 2022",0,"I’ve had sensitive bladder issues since I had a spinal fusion surgery in 2015.  Myrbetric was helping but the constant urges got worse. I did the Botox injections and in October.  I have not been able to go without catheterising since the Botox.  I’m hoping it will eventually wear off so I can go on my own.  As for the sensitivity, it is still there.  The Botox injections made my problem worse.  I’m planning to see a different urologist in February.  Still looking for a solution.",Frances
1,Botox,Overactive Bladder,1.0,,"July 26, 2021",0,After my second injection of Botox I was worst off.  Didn't get a 3rd injection.  Why did this happen?Seems I can't get an answer.  Was the injection in the correct area for the Botox. No meds seem to help I would always have urinary track infections constantly for about 3 years.  Always taking Flomax.What is my next best alternative.  Can't go out an enjoy the day or evening.  House bound.,KAT
2,Botox,Overactive Bladder,,,"February 21, 2021",3,This procedure has totally changed my life I wish I  had done it years ago. The doctor put liticane in my bladder for 30 minutes prior to the shots and I had no pain at all. I have no accidents now and I can go hours without having to go I feel like I have gotten my life back,Anonymous
3,Botox,Overactive Bladder,10.0,,"November 6, 2020",4,I've been having bladder botox for several years now under general anaesthetic. I've had bad experiences with other procedures and opted for general anaesthetic. It has been a life changed for me after needing to go to the toilet up to 17 times a day. No side effects other than first couple of weeks needing to really push out to clear the bladder. But this passed. I'm glad I went for general anaesthetic as my Dad went for local and had to stop as too painful and he's got a high pain threshold. Good luck to you all,Fi
4,Botox,Overactive Bladder,8.0,,"July 26, 2020",4,"Female, 80. 3 single births within 2-1/2 yrs, the 1st being largest, 8 lb, 10 oz. Over the years, diagnosed with urge incontinence, stress incontinence & OAB. Sling surgery earlier this year for stress incontinence - has worked like a miracle for coughing/sneezing but nothing else. Meds didn't do much for urge or OAB (sample Myrbetriq/too $$, a few months of oxybutynin, then trospium). Botox about 3-1/2 wks ago. Was very uncomfortable and post-op, pain was intensifying. I started suspecting UTI and was correct. Probably caused by leaky bowel (an entire another problem!) since culture showed e.coli. Now that that's cleared up, I can evaluate the Botox procedure as being 50%-75% successful. Fewer pads, less laundry and overall more comfortable. My urologist said treatment should last 6-9 months. As of now, will repeat. Am glad I did not research it prior to surgery. I believe the failures posted would have  made me very hesitant. I am so sorry for those who went through pain and failure.",Horseless
5,Botox,Overactive Bladder,5.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"December 21, 2019",3,"I had a Botox bladder injection early in 2019 (low dose) and even though it didn't completely work, I felt my leakage was less.  Last week I had another stronger dose and I am leaking worse than ever and I just had an episode where I stood up and had no control over my bladder at all.  These reviews made me feel better because I couldn't find anything on the Web about Botox making the issue worse until I read other reviews.  I still have faith that maybe it just hasn't started working yet but who knows...I may just keep leaking. As far as the pain involved in the injection, maybe some people are super sensitive or maybe some physicians are better than others but I found it to be only mildly uncomfortable.  There was a little cramping but nothing too bad.  I was shocked that some people go under general anesthesia for this! Fingers (or legs) crossed that it starts working.",cj in MT
6,Botox,Overactive Bladder,8.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"December 14, 2019",3,"I had the botox injections for overactive about 3 months ago for incontinence. I am 47 and was constantly leaking. Having tried all other methods, I was offered botox. I was a bit dubious at first, but have a really good incontinence nurse and urologist. Everything was clearly explained and I had to show I could self-catherterise before they would do the procedure.  The procedure was a little uncomfortable and stung once or twice, other than that it was fine and I watched on the screen. The procedure worked for me, I can sneeze and cough without peeing myself. I have had one UTI since I had it done, but cleared with antibiotics.I do still occassionally leak, but that if my bladder is full and I put pressure on my bladder. I was lucky, I didn't need to self-catheterise. I'm glad I had it done. I'm am sorry for the people who it didn't work for",Lynndelou
