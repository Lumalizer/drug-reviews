0,Leuprolide,Female Infertility,9,Taken for less than 1 month,"October 2, 2012",12,Lupron (leuprolide):EXTREME HEADACHES!! Lupron - I started the medication 5 days ago and starting on day 3 I began getting really bad headaches and it doesn't seem to ever go away. I cannot take Advil so I'm not sure if that would help. I tried taking a nap but I wake up and it's still there. Never had this problem before so I'm certain it's the Lupron. Other than that I have no other complaints.,SandraCa
