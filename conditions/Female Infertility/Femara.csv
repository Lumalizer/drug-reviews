I consulted many doctors, different doctors different advises!! I started dieting and exercise but nothing worked! I was then told to start glucophage 500 mg and femara on my periods days 2-5. I had no side effects.With the grace of almighty I conceived that month itself and have twin baby boys now..",Sarah
1,Femara,Female Infertility,10,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"December 6, 2021",22,"We tried for a year and half to fall pregnant, then I discovered I had fibroids had to have them surgically removed. 8months later discovered I had gallstone & had to have my entire gallbladder removed which was another set back. 4months after my gallbladder removal now 42yrs old, the fertility Professor that removed my fibroids done a ultra sound said I have a few eggs but my age is against me and I would need to go on Femara along with artificial insemination.  My partner was not keen on AI he was more for it happening naturally and if it's God's will. I had the prescription for the Femara to take 2 tablets for 5 days starting on the 3rd day of my period took it in September without AI & nothing. Got my periods October again and I decided to give Femara 1 last go and after that I was going to give up & I thought it was just not meant to be. November 2021 I was 1week late for my period took a pregnancy test & BOOM positive. There is hope ladies wishing u luck with baby dust.X",Mom to Be
