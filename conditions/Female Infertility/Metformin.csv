0,Metformin,Female Infertility,7.0,,"March 22, 2022",0,I was given metformin by my doctor two 500mg twice a day  as I have PCOS and never had regular periods or even ovulated. I’ve recently lost some weight and my periods have come back each month.  I’m 27 and 21 stone we’ve been trying for a baby for over a year it’s my second month taking metformin and I’ve ovulated  as it was confirmed with a blood test. I’m testing my urine everyday with ovulation strips and tracking everything…good luck to all! X,Anonymous
1,Metformin,Female Infertility,4.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"January 14, 2022",1,So the purpose of my doctor putting me on this medication was so that I’m able to ovulate. She said my lack of ovulation MAY be caused by PCOS but she’s not sure because I don’t have any of the symptoms except for not ovulating. So far I’ve only been on this for about 3 days now. I’ve had stomach aches here and there but lots of trips to the bathroom. Today after the 3rd day I noticed when I was done using the bathroom I was spotting. I find this really strange because I have already gotten my period this month …is this normal ? Right now I’m on a dosage of 750 and will increase to 1500 next week. My goal is to ovulate so that I’m able to have a baby :) will keep you all posted,Anonymous
2,Metformin,Female Infertility,10.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"January 2, 2022",4,"4 days after my 34th birthday I was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes. My family doctor prescribed metformin... On that same day I had been on my monthly cycle 2 days. She failed to mention this could possibly increase fertility) which I never had any issues with. I was like clock work when it can to my period.Only once I was ever over 3 days late I was pregnant. (Which was twice)We she said she wanted to see me in 3 weeks. When I went to reception they said she was going to be on vacation that 3rd week.So .. 5 weeks later I was on my way to my appt.. thinking. Oh now. I'm at least a week late. Didn't mention it to her. Left the doc appt. 45 days after starting metformin. I had 2 positive home tests. I'm now expecting my second child (had a miscarriage at 12 weeks in Nov. 2019)We didn't want any more children - we have 3 in home total, and this information needs to be more stressed when prescribed.But we are due March 2, 2022.

3,Metformin,Female Infertility,10.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"December 29, 2021",11,I’ve been taking Metformin for 2 months now as I have PCOS and I am so happy I’m pregnant I also used the clear blue ovulation box as I’m so irregular but after my first period I’m pregnant so don’t give up - it really worked for me.,Anonymous
4,Metformin,Female Infertility,10.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"November 30, 2021",4,"I am 32, have been TTC for nearly three years, and have quite severe PCOS and very high AMH levels. We had one miscarriage in November 2020. I began taking Metformin (1000g) in September 2021, and within a couple of weeks I got my period (in itself an achievement!) and was able to begin taking Clomid to help me ovulate. Fast forward two months and I am currently 5 weeks pregnant! I will keep taking Metformin for at least another month and then my doctor will review it with me.My best advice with Metformin is to start slow and build it up. My doctor suggested I start with one 500g pill a day for a week and work up to taking two a day. I also like to take Metformin with food or I can get a little nauseous. Good luck to every single PCOS warrior out there!",Han Clark

6,Metformin,Female Infertility,7.0,,"May 13, 2021",47,I was diagnosed with diabetes in October. A doctor I was recommended to see has prescribed me Metformin to help me with my blood sugar level. It was pretty bad. But she forgot to inform me that this medicine help to ovulate women or help them get pregnant. I didn't know that all I know I wanted to get my sugar level on control. So after I took them about one month after I got pregnant. I really didn't want to get pregnant or wasn't trying because I have two kids already. And I wasn't planning to have more AT ALL. By January I found out I was a month and a half. I was surprised I cry so much because I didn't want this is not that I don't love kids because I do I have two boys and I love them so much. It just is hard is really hard to bring a baby in this life we live in. But I as a mother of two would bring this baby into this world healthy and full of love. Sorry my story is long but I just wanted to tell someone about this experience.,Blessed

22,Metformin,Female Infertility,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"December 12, 2019",13,"I have PCOS and had a successful pregnancy with clomid 2 years ago at 150mg after taking clomid for 5 months.  I started clomid again 150mg for 9 months with no success this time. I did ovulate every month though. My obgyn referred me to a fertility specialist and after doing more lab work decided to put me on a dose of metformin 850mg 2 tabs per day of metformin. I took 1 tab for 1 week and  the 2 tabs on the second week.  The first week I had diarrhea , nausea , headache but was tolerable . I also got my period 6 days after starting metformin after not having one for almost 6 months .. so that’s a plus. On the second week of metformin dosage of 1700mg my side effects got worse I still have diarrhea, light headed , stomach pain and also vomiting . I take it at dinner time. Once I get home since I work in the day time.  Hope this works with all these side effects lol . When I was on  clomid I did not have any side effects. I’ll update You ladies and see if I ovulate :)",Sophie
23,Metformin,Female Infertility,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"November 23, 2019",12,"My endocrinologist recommended metformin for a few reason, to reduce hair and acne on my back and chest to help with fertility. Speaking of fertility, me and SO had been trying for 2 years. We took the step to go through IVF.  We went to see the specialist did all the tests and was going back to see him when my period was 2 days late, however my cycle is on time every month so it seemed a bit odd. Took a pregnancy test came back positive, it was pure shock as the following week had my appointment with IVF. We were ecstatic, which was short lived as I had a miscarriage.  It has now been 4 weeks and I'm late again for my period but I've taken 3 pregnancy tests and all came back negative. So I'm confused as to whats going on.  I started metformin yesterday and the specialist said it will not affect my pregnancy  (if I am pregnant) or conceiving. Any chance my cycle has changed due to me miscarrying or could they be false readings? Just would like to hear everyone else experiences if similar to mine.",Zee
