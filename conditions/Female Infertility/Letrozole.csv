2,Letrozole,Female Infertility,9.0,,"March 5, 2022",5,"I’ve been trying to conceive from 2017 to 2022. I was seeing an endocrinologist and all he suggested was IVF. Finely I saw a new endocrinologist January 2022 and he was great. This doctor suggested I take Letrozole 2.5mg twice daily to ovulate because I have PCOS. He also suggested I get the digital ovulation clear blue test so I can test for ovulation. I did exactly what the endocrinologist doctor told me to do and got a positive ovulation test February 8th and 9th. Positive pregnancy test February 22nd and a beta hcg blood to confirm pregnancy levels of 1449. I’m currently 5 weeks and 2 days pregnant early I know but letrozole worked for me. I have had problems getting pregnant for 5 years, one hsg, almost did an IUI and now I’m pregnant. I’m so excited letrozole worked on day 3 of cycle to day 7. I had no side effects in taking Letrozole.",Anonymous

I took 2 rounds, the first was 2.5mg and I did not ovulate due to an ovarian cyst. My second round was 5mg and I had two mature follicles on my sonogram.

5,Letrozole,Female Infertility,10.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"February 15, 2022",2,"I have suffered with PCOS for years and have never been pregnant before. Me and my partner have had unprotected sex for astound 5 years. He has low sperm morphology. We were told to have IVF/ICSI straight away, but then a different fertility nurse told me to try letrozole just in case. I was certain it wouldn’t work. I was prescribed 2.5mg days 2-6. The first month it didn’t work, despite us having timed sex and having ovulation confirmed by ultra sound. No trigger shot or blood tests. On the second month (this month!), it worked! I still can’t believe it. Had blazing positive tests on 10dpo. One thing I would say is that on both months, my boobs were VERY sore, so maybe this is a side effect of letrozole instead of pregnancy. I also had mild headaches on both rounds. Aside from this, letrozole has been absolutely fine and I haven’t had any serious side effects, I’d of happily continued taking it if I didn’t get pregnant. Don’t lose hope!!! 10/10 from me.",Anonymous

I had a blood test on day 22 which showed it didn’t work. Same process was repeated and my dose was increased to 5 mg, didn’t work. Same process but I was given 7.5 mg and it didn’t work. However, the next month (still at 7.5mg) my hormone level was at a 7 in my bloodwork. My doctor said it needs to be at least 20 to ovulate, but up until then, my number was always less than 1, so for it to be 7 was a good jump! My period actually came naturally, and that month at the same dose I OVULATED. I didn’t get pregnant but that was fine - I was so excited to have ovulated. My period came naturally again & I took the same dose but didn’t ovulate! My number was less than 1 again. Am I ovulating after the blood test? Has this happened to anyone else?",Babydustpls

If you are checking the reviews for letrozole that means you are here to find out if it helped in conceiving for others. I am suffering from PCOS. My cycles are regular and also ovulation would happen in all the cycles. But the quality of eggs were not so good. So I decided on taking the letrozole. 1st month I took from cycle day 2-7 (5mg). Got my periods. I wasn’t really disappointed because whatever medicines you take, it takes some time for your body to adjust. I continued the letrozole for 2nd cycle. Just exactly on my expected period date I had cramping and brown spotting. No periods! As I mentioned I had a very regular cycle despite of PCOS, I waited for a week. And took a test! Booom I saw my 1st BFP at 5 weeks. For ladies who are trying to conceive, remember that not everyone’s body is same. Just have faith and keep trying.",Lily

I have PCOS and was put on Letrozole as was trying to conceive since July, only had 2 cycles and wasn’t ovulating.

This was my first cycle on the medication, I was getting symptoms on cycle day 17/18 and decided to try an ovulation test on day 18 (always had negatives with ovulation tests as I know these aren’t reliable with PCOS) and for first time ever it came back with a positive smiley face so we made sure to try then. I was getting some early pregnancy symptoms around cycle day 24 but could also be mistaken for PMS so didn’t want to over think it. I took pregnancy test yesterday, dpo 12/13 and got my first BFP!!

27,Letrozole,Female Infertility,,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"October 7, 2021",4,"The best tablet for getting ovulate and conceive. Please connect with your doctor to find out the root cause of your issue and then do take tablets accordingly. If doctor suggests you letrozole please don't hesitate in taking the medication since this will fullfill your wish of getting pregnant. This is from my personal experience I suggest. Even though in first cycle it didn't work out don't give up please try till doctor suggests. I had irregular periods due to hormonal imbalance since my puberty. After finding the root cause I took letrozole and in third cycle I got pregnant. In first cycle, my didn't work out with the tablet but with the second cycle it actually worked but due to personal issue it didn't form a baby and got periods at the correct time. After getting periods at the correct date, I got really the best hope and took the tablet for the third cycle and the miracle happened. God blessed us.
