0,Rituximab,Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma,,Taken for less than 1 month,"February 12, 2022",0,Had first round yesterday. Midway had a reaction of extreme chills and shakes. Benadryl and reduced drip to counter. I should have waited longer after treatment to walk. Got just outside building and dropped like a rock. Spent next eight hours in E. All my fault. Have another scheduled in one week. Will take snacks along and wait longer after treatment to become ambulatory.,Wait and See
1,Rituximab,Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"November 16, 2019",11,"Rituxan (rituximab):I had my first treatment two days ago for NHL and other than a flu like symptoms once or twice a day I feel good for at least 6 hours and then I will take motrin and feel good another 6 hours.  I feel great in the morning and go down hill in the afternoon.  What's odd is that my hip and leg pain on my left side is going away.  I don't know if Rituxan can work that fast but I feel better already.  I have the infusion once a week so we'll see how I continue to do.  But so far I'm only missing one day a week of work and that's my infusion day.  The next day is a little tough from feeling so tired but then I feel back to my old self for a few hours,",Neena
2,Rituximab,Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma,8.0,,"September 2, 2017",8,"I started this treatment with Chronic Fatigue Syndrome. However, since my first treatment my fatigue has become debilitating, I don't have enough energy to do any of the things I normally do, I had 4 treatments in May, then 4 more infusions in August. The fatigue lingers like a fog that will not lift.My sleep pattern has changed. I wakeup 3 to 5 hours after going to sleep feeling wide awake. I cannot stay in the bed though I am still sleepy.I have dreams that are so realistic that I participate in them, or act them out. My attention span is shot. I can't concentrate on what I am trying to do and end up jumping from one thing to another.",Jimmy210
3,Rituximab,Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma,,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"February 25, 2017",30,"Rituxan (rituximab):After 6 rounds of chemo (2 drugs, 2 days - Bendamustine & Retuximab), I had Stage 3 b-cell Lymphoma, I am cancer free.  My oncologist wants me to do a maintenance program of the Retuximab every 2 months for 2 years.  Is the maintenance necessary?",SuzRJ
4,Rituximab,Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma,10.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"May 6, 2016",1,"2 years on maintenance rituximab after 8 cycles of rcvp 15 months later 5 lymph nodes biopsied in breast ,Think it has grown again I was stage 4b  I went into partial remission,",Christmasloon
5,Rituximab,Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma,1.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"April 3, 2016",13,"I had three treatments of Bendamustine and rituximab for indolent follicular lymphoma. It seemed to work well on the lymphoma,  which has not completely gone, but after the third treatment I developed shortness of breath. It took doctors a month to diagnose it as rituximab induced lung disease (bronchiolitis oblivitans). I am now  permanently and severely disabled, unable to walk more than 10 feet, extreme difficulty in caring for myself. I am 55 with no other medical conditions, three months ago I could run, ski, and enjoy life. This drug destroyed the quality of my life and created complications for fighting lymphoma. The doctors said it was safe. I was not told about the serious and potentially fatal side effects.",Anonymous
6,Rituximab,Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma,9.0,Taken for 5 to 10 years,"May 14, 2013",63,"Rituxan (rituximab):In 2009 after 6 rounds of RCHOP chemo, then BCNU chemo in the hospital, a bone marrow transplant, I had 3 years of remission. In Oct. 2012, rediagnosed out of remission, started on 6 rounds of bendamustine and Rituxan. The 6th month was skipped due to a low WBC of 2.4. I will continue on Rituxan for maintenance. I began my journey at stage 4E. I was rediagnosed after a fall in May, and was back to stage 4 by October 2012, so the combination of bendamustine and Rituxan have done good. I will receive Rituxan every 3 months or sooner as a precautionary measure.",jmbwholesale
7,Rituximab,Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma,8.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"October 21, 2012",4,"I had chills, shakes and low blood pressure at my first infusion. Subsequent infusions were easier, but still difficult. I think it's 8 of 10 due to side effects, and I know it works well for many people. Not for all though.",hat_hat

The result was total remission, which truly amazed me. It's almost three years now, and I often think about what situation I'd be in if it hadn't been detected purely by chance.",exador
10,Rituximab,Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma,10.0,,"October 3, 2011",109,"Rituxan (rituximab):After first round of chemo with Rituxan...my lymphoma lump was completely gone to the touch.  Yes...I did have a mild reaction the first time Rituxan was administered, but it was easily resolved with a little Benadryl and a slow down of the Rituxan drip.  I did not have any allergic reaction of the subsequent two rounds of chemo.  After only three rounds of chemo, I had another PET/CT scan...and was deemed in total remission.  Almost a year later....and still no return of the lymphoma and I feel great.  It is amazing what medical science can do today to treat and cure people of cancer.",Anonymous
11,Rituximab,Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma,9.0,,"March 30, 2011",74,Rituxan (rituximab):Extremely important medicine for me with Lymphoma low grade stage 1 under my right eyelid. Very rare location for lymphoma. The first time I did 4 sessions with Rituxan in Jun/2010 and now March/2011 the second time. The pictures show my eyes before and after and big different this medicine made. Thanks doctors and nurses for brilliant work. Itchy was my first side effect and second time no side effects at all. Highly recommended.,Duarte
12,Rituximab,Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma,9.0,,"December 4, 2010",68,"Rituxan (rituximab):Just finished my sixth round of chemo treatment.  I had Follicular B Cell Lymphoma.  One on my right shoulder, one on in my neck and two on my chest.  After fourth round and a PET scan, Doctor diagnosed me as being in 100% remission.  I will do more research on the Rituxan  maintenance program recommended by my Oncologist.  I had a reaction to the Rituxan my first treatment but did not have any other problems with the medicine.  Highly recommended",rlhatfield7

The first infusion helped shrink the nodes and spleen but only by 1/2.  The Bexxar brought them to normal size. I'm trying Rituxan again because two nodes popped up 2 and 1/2 years after the Bexxar.  It is hoped that the Rituxan will operate as a maintenance to remission.  If so, the two enlarged nodes will be radiated to keep growth in check.",why not
