0,Rituxan,Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"November 16, 2019",11,"I had my first treatment two days ago for NHL and other than a flu like symptoms once or twice a day I feel good for at least 6 hours and then I will take motrin and feel good another 6 hours.  I feel great in the morning and go down hill in the afternoon.  What's odd is that my hip and leg pain on my left side is going away.  I don't know if Rituxan can work that fast but I feel better already.  I have the infusion once a week so we'll see how I continue to do.  But so far I'm only missing one day a week of work and that's my infusion day.  The next day is a little tough from feeling so tired but then I feel back to my old self for a few hours,",Neena
1,Rituxan,Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma,,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"February 25, 2017",30,"After 6 rounds of chemo (2 drugs, 2 days - Bendamustine & Retuximab), I had Stage 3 b-cell Lymphoma, I am cancer free.  My oncologist wants me to do a maintenance program of the Retuximab every 2 months for 2 years.  Is the maintenance necessary?",SuzRJ
2,Rituxan,Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma,9.0,Taken for 5 to 10 years,"May 14, 2013",63,"In 2009 after 6 rounds of RCHOP chemo, then BCNU chemo in the hospital, a bone marrow transplant, I had 3 years of remission. In Oct. 2012, rediagnosed out of remission, started on 6 rounds of bendamustine and Rituxan. The 6th month was skipped due to a low WBC of 2.4. I will continue on Rituxan for maintenance. I began my journey at stage 4E. I was rediagnosed after a fall in May, and was back to stage 4 by October 2012, so the combination of bendamustine and Rituxan have done good. I will receive Rituxan every 3 months or sooner as a precautionary measure.",jmbwholesale
3,Rituxan,Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma,10.0,,"February 29, 2012",97,"I am doing maintenance with Rituxan for Non Hodgin's Lymphoma. Last Chemo was March 2011. This medicine saved my life, and still does so.",Anonymous
4,Rituxan,Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma,10.0,,"October 21, 2011",59,"I had Rituximab treatment over four weeks for a lymphoma on my newly (three months) transplanted kidney. The result was total remission, which truly amazed me. It's almost three years now, and I often think about what situation I'd be in if it hadn't been detected purely by chance.",exador
5,Rituxan,Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma,10.0,,"October 3, 2011",109,"After first round of chemo with Rituxan...my lymphoma lump was completely gone to the touch.  Yes...I did have a mild reaction the first time Rituxan was administered, but it was easily resolved with a little Benadryl and a slow down of the Rituxan drip.  I did not have any allergic reaction of the subsequent two rounds of chemo.  After only three rounds of chemo, I had another PET/CT scan...and was deemed in total remission.  Almost a year later....and still no return of the lymphoma and I feel great.  It is amazing what medical science can do today to treat and cure people of cancer.",Anonymous
6,Rituxan,Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma,9.0,,"March 30, 2011",74,Extremely important medicine for me with Lymphoma low grade stage 1 under my right eyelid. Very rare location for lymphoma. The first time I did 4 sessions with Rituxan in Jun/2010 and now March/2011 the second time. The pictures show my eyes before and after and big different this medicine made. Thanks doctors and nurses for brilliant work. Itchy was my first side effect and second time no side effects at all. Highly recommended.,Duarte
7,Rituxan,Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma,9.0,,"December 4, 2010",68,"Just finished my sixth round of chemo treatment.  I had Follicular B Cell Lymphoma.  One on my right shoulder, one on in my neck and two on my chest.  After fourth round and a PET scan, Doctor diagnosed me as being in 100% remission.  I will do more research on the Rituxan  maintenance program recommended by my Oncologist.  I had a reaction to the Rituxan my first treatment but did not have any other problems with the medicine.  Highly recommended",rlhatfield7
8,Rituxan,Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma,9.0,,"December 11, 2008",52,"This is my second round with Rituxan (3 and 1/2 years ago and now). Two years ago I had Bexxar. The first infusion helped shrink the nodes and spleen but only by 1/2.  The Bexxar brought them to normal size. I'm trying Rituxan again because two nodes popped up 2 and 1/2 years after the Bexxar.  It is hoped that the Rituxan will operate as a maintenance to remission.  If so, the two enlarged nodes will be radiated to keep growth in check.",why not
9,Rituxan,Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma,8.0,,"September 21, 2008",103,"I thought this was a spectacular medicine, very quick acting engorged lymph nodes were reduced within about 7 days. I am now in remission and doing maintenance.",Lt_Taz
