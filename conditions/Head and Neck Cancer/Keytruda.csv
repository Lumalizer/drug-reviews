2,Keytruda,Head and Neck Cancer,1,Taken for less than 1 month,"February 7, 2020",38,"After my husband  lived through 3 separate squamous cell mouth cancers, the  4th recurred.Was advised by drs 5 weeks twice a day Proton therapy and once every 3 wks Keytruda. Two weeks after receiving Keytruda, his beautiful (non-smoking) lungs were chemically burned from Keytruda. They treated him with high dose of steroids and said he would have to be on them at least, if not more, for 1 year.  it was explained steroids at this dosage carried high side effects such as badly damaging kidneys and other organs. My husband chose death. Told me if I ever get diagnosed with cancer, just let it take me. Said it’s not worth the treatment, which is what really finishes you off. Ironically, 2 weeks later a friend also died from Keytruda after badly damaging  his lungs too.You don’t realize you are the test subject for these drug companies. Beware of this drug!",Broken-hearted

4,Keytruda,Head and Neck Cancer,10,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"October 13, 2018",17,"I've been on Keytruda for eleven months now. So far the growth has slowed to where we can call it ""arrested"". At least it has bought me another year of life.The side-effects are manageable, for me at least, so I guess I'm one of the ""lucky"" (I don't feel lucky having cancer to begin with) ones from reading the other reviews.",Artemis Captain
5,Keytruda,Head and Neck Cancer,10,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"October 2, 2018",16,"4 injections so far on Keytruda as a first line HNSCC treatment. No side effects. Approximately 70% reduction already in my left side face swelling which is due to swollen lymph nodes that have been swollen for years. 3 month MRI due Oct 8th 2018, so too early to say anything about tumor response. Diagnosed 6 years ago but did no treatment until Keytruda as I did not want to do radiation in the oral cavity and was offered nothing else. I have found many sources indicating the patient must have an undamaged microbiome for the treatment to work effectively. Patients on previous platinum based chemotherapies will have a weak microbiome. Action should be taken to restore the microbiome prior to starting immunotherapy.  John",john

8,Keytruda,Head and Neck Cancer,1,,"August 24, 2017",29,"I personally do not advise keytruda to anyone. I had a love one walk into the oncologist to receive this treatment and three weeks later she was wheeled back into the oncologists office, unable to walk her body was falling apart thanks to this atrocious treatment. Five weeks have gone by and she is currently laying in a hospital bed in the middle of her living room unresponsive and is thought to pass away within the next three days. Please keep loved ones away from it.",Anonymous
