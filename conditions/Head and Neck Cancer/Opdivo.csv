0,Opdivo,Head and Neck Cancer,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"February 13, 2021",3,These drugs poisoned my best friend.  He had been doing well and after 2 treatments with these drugs he is a dying vegetable,JJ
1,Opdivo,Head and Neck Cancer,10.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"January 22, 2021",2,"When I was about to start Opdivo, I was told it was not a curebut a life extender.  I prepared myself by taking natural immune boosters one month before start of Opdivo and during treatment.The tumor in my mouth started shrinking after 10 days from start of treatment.  After 25 doses (4wk schedule) and two years, I stopped my treatment.  The tumor was gone by the first year.  Hospice was my option before Opdivo saved me.Side effects where rash on face for  a week every three weeks out from my dose.  Natural immune boosters, Chaga tea, Astragalus, and Boswellia serrata.",CJL138
2,Opdivo,Head and Neck Cancer,,Taken for less than 1 month,"July 11, 2018",4,"Just started opdivo last week. Will have it every two weeks. Had to have a full laryngectomy seven months ago because of a tumor in back of throat. Was hoping to get a voice prothesis to talk again but , they discovered two small cancerous tumors on my tongue. Surgery, of course is not an option . Hoping opdivo will shrink these tumors at the very least if not destroy them altogether.",Jenkins
3,Opdivo,Head and Neck Cancer,1.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"July 8, 2018",10,"My Father was on Opdivo for 77 days. He became sick with all of the side effects (pneumonia, inflammation of the brain) as well as ultimately losing the use of both of his legs. In my opinion, the drug only increased his life by 77 painful days and it did nothing effective at all. I do not recommend using this drug at all.",Lt
