0,Herceptin,Salivary Gland Cancer,10,,"June 30, 2009",40,My husband has been on Herceptin for his salivary gland cancer for 2 years.  The fight to keep him on it has been harrowing as it is only formally approved for breast cancer.  I truly believe it saved his life.  He tested HER-2/neu positive (3) which is normally located in the breast.  Dr. Posner (Dana Farber in Boston) recommended a course of treatment that included Herceptin. His Petscans have now been clear and treatment can stop at the end of August.  More needs to be done to allow life saving treatment.,Jetmom
