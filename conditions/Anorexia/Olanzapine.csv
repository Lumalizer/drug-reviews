0,Olanzapine,Anorexia,,,"March 12, 2022",0,"I took zyprexa 5mg for only 5 days and I don't know what happened to me.. since that pill entered my system I feel like a weird person away from myself, it's been two months and I'm starting to feel a little bit better but I still have difficulty with coordination and movement and every time I move my head I hear a weird voice. Also there is pain in all my joints (jaw, neck, hands) thats the worst thing and I feel tired when I do anything beside the muscle rigidity and pain the bones. I wish to feel normal again. Never take this medicine its the worst",Anonymous
1,Olanzapine,Anorexia,1.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"August 2, 2021",0,I was on Olanzapine 7.5mg for 2 months. When we decreased my dose to 5mg I could not sleep at all. Then we started a liquid compound taper with my psychiatrist reducing by 0.1mg a week. 8 weeks into tapering I ran again into insomnia which I have never had before. I'm now stuck on this drug because if I reduce it further I don't sleep. It caused permanent brain damage. This drug should be withdrawn from the market and the people behind it  be made responsible,Shitprexa

This medication causes, tardive dyskinesia, horrible anxiety and memory loss. This medication will decrease your quality of life and lifespan.  We need to stop Big Pharma from manufacturing this stuff.",Anonymous
