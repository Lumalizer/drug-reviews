4,Ipratropium,COPD Maintenance,10,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"November 6, 2012",23,Atrovent (ipratropium):This works. It's about the only prescription inhaler that does work. This one works. It is not as good as Primatene Mist but it does work. Side effects including the standard steroid use warning though.,mcpepper111
5,Ipratropium,COPD Maintenance,10,,"June 25, 2011",57,"Atrovent (ipratropium):Up until a recent diagnosis of emphysema, I used Atrovent only if I got a pain in my lungs because of COPD.  After a couple of days, pain was gone and I felt good.  Now I am using Atrovent 4 times per day, and it continues to be a great medication that I can count on to work.",Anonymous
