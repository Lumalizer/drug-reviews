0,Incruse Ellipta,COPD Maintenance,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"August 6, 2019",20,"I quit this after suffering through two weeks of the worst of its listed side effects; this stuff is BAD. I couldn't function. What's the point of breathing if you can't live your life due to aches, pains, dizziness, the runs, you-name-it?  Horrible poison.",Angry

2,Incruse Ellipta,COPD Maintenance,2.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"March 15, 2019",15,"After 2 weeks on drug, leg muscles became too weak to be able to support walking, having to use a cane now and having to hold on to furniture just to move around the house. Doctor said muscle weakness is not a known side effect but did not suggest what the problem could be or what to do, other than stop drug and see if symptoms resolve. Three weeks now off the drug and no change. Ultra sound done on legs showed nothing wrong and PET scan is also scheduled. I was fine until I started using this drug, other than breathing problems, which was the reason drug was prescribed.Mar 13, 2019, 11:12 AM (2 days ago)",flamingo333
3,Incruse Ellipta,COPD Maintenance,1.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"August 18, 2018",33,"I started on Incruse as a replacement for Spriva (which I was doing fine with) but Medicare would no longer pay for. I had a horrible experience with it. The mouth/tooth pain was unbearable,  anxiety/ panic was intensified, heart palpitations worsened , throat pain, hoarseness and my breathing problems became so much worse. I took it for about 7 weeks, hoping all adverse affects would resolve itself. But it just became to unbearable. So I discontinued it and only using Advair discus for maintenance. It was a horrible drug for me.",Sickofcopd
4,Incruse Ellipta,COPD Maintenance,10.0,,"April 30, 2018",17,"Was prescribed Incurse along with the Breo. I like this medication, so far it is working for me, no shortness of breath or wheezing. I have more energy, I hope that I can continue to use these medications, I have a coupon for the incurse, and a free 30 day sample for the Breo. I will try to  find a coupon for the Breo. I like this better than the Symbicort that my insurance stopped paying for. My insurance will help with the Breo, but not much.",Diane
5,Incruse Ellipta,COPD Maintenance,,Taken for less than 1 month,"January 15, 2018",16,"Got the Incruse Ellipta due to my insurance stopped covering Spiriva.  Used it once, funny taste and felt like I was having an asthma episode which stayed with me all day.  I had to meet my deductible so paid over $300 for this inhaler.  Will not use it again, will call my pulmonary Dr. tomorrow and see if I can get the Spiriva back.",no nickname
