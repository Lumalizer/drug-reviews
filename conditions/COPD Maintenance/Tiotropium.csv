0,Tiotropium,COPD Maintenance,4.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"February 26, 2022",0,Spiriva (tiotropium):Spiriva’s Handihaler delivery system is a complete disgrace.  I have had many conversations with manufacturer and they are unwilling to own up to the fact that either the handihaler is defective or the capsules are duds.   SHAME.,Anonymous
1,Tiotropium,COPD Maintenance,5.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"February 1, 2022",0,Spiriva (tiotropium):While it has helped my COPD I have had many problems over the years with the handihaler not working properly and ruining capsule   Initially we were given one handihaler with 90 day supply and now each 30 day supply has a handihaler but it doesn’t matter - I have been forced to discard many capsules due to malfunction of handihaler and I think this company should be ashamed of themselves.  I have tried to resolve this with them and they have been very uncooperative,Stefan
2,Tiotropium,COPD Maintenance,7.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"January 26, 2022",0,"Spiriva Respimat (tiotropium):I had to go on it because Salbutamol use became excessive and not really working anymore. I do struggle a bit with side effects, but I am 64 and have a post viral syndrome, so any medication can whack me around.   I go to the loo a bit on this and a bit itchy but otherwise it is great to breath freely again, just like I used to! I do get a bit of trouble getting off to sleep but that is getting better. I persevere with this because I know my life is being shortened with COPD and it can only get worse and this medication may alleviate the worst symptoms in the next few years.  I do not like gasping for breath while talking to my husband. Not a nice look",Delia

4,Tiotropium,COPD Maintenance,7.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"November 9, 2021",2,"Spiriva Respimat (tiotropium):Important! Please keep watchful eye on the side of the Respimat container. When the orange area with arrow shows at end please do not try to continue using the container vs opening a new one. Why? Because I tried seeing how many dosages more I could get and on one attempt the second I pressed the grey button the container bruised my lip and on next attempt the container shot a piece of metal out along with mist so I discarded the container & opened new box .. This issue needs to be fixed as I'm lucky I kept the container away from mouth second try or that metal shooting out would have hit my throat causing possible injury.

5,Tiotropium,COPD Maintenance,3.0,,"October 21, 2021",0,"Spiriva (tiotropium):I have taken Spiriva Respimat for a total of thirty days; two weeks and a five day break and another 2 ½ weeks. It does improve my breathing a little bit but the side effects are not worth the slight easing of my breathing. I have extremely dry throat, sometimes can barely talk, my heartbeat went up significantly, my eyesight is all blurring so that I can hardly see to read, heartburn and generally feeling lousy. I am stopping it no matter what my GP thinks…and she is very bossy. However I feel generally too rotten to continue…absolutely no energy or motivation to do anything. I give it a 3 ½ out of ten because it does ease my breathing somewhat. I wish that I was one of the ones with no side effects. I have never smoked a single cigarette so how I came to have COPD is beyond me. My husband didn’t smoke either.",Lana
6,Tiotropium,COPD Maintenance,3.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"October 11, 2021",1,Spiriva (tiotropium):My biggest concern is the fact in every carton of Spiriva you can be sure you will have empty capsules or the handihaler makes exceedingly big holes in capsule.

7,Tiotropium,COPD Maintenance,5.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"October 1, 2021",0,"Spiriva (tiotropium):I have taken it for 2 ½ weeks and haven’t noticed any difference in my breathing. Because I have a giant hernia I can’t do a PF test so don’t know if I have COPD or asthma. One GP said asthma the next said COPD. I currently use Symbicort with Salbutamol when needed. I have never smoked. The Spiriva gave me sores in my mouth, an extremely dry mouth and throat, anxiety and bad, side and leg pain, though I am not sure it caused all of that as I have other chronic conditions. Since it didn’t help I have stopped it to see if the sores, anxiety and back pain go away or reduce. I don’t know how to rate it because I was in a severe car accident that ruptured my diaphragm, collapsed one lung and a severely fractured femur. I was on a ventilator for over a week and wonder if my breathing problems aren’t a result of that so I will give a tentative 5.",Smallrain

I'm having very bad blurred vision, extreme insomnia, tachycardia, I suffer from mental fogginess, forgetfulness, confusion, dizziness, (I am only 44years old ), I also jump with any noise and get scared easily, I also have mayor anxiety. I suffered from insomnia before, but not like this. I feel as I always have fluid in my lungs, something in my throat, I have a running nose constantly, (I am fully vaccinated, had minor side effects, but everything always targets my chest). Spiriva has controlled my asthma for a while, but now I'm not so sure, if I didn't take it or forgot to, I would not be able to breathe. I have tried well over 9 asthma medications and had severe side effects to most. Spiriva did help me manage to reduce the use of my albuterol (emergency inhaler).

My Dr insists this is the right medication for me and if I would lose weight I will feel better.

Of course the empty capsules were a big problem and the respimat solved that problem with a hefty price increase. I thought I couldn't live without it but once on Medicare I had to quit buying it due to the high price. I also had noticed that I had to urinate infrequently and could go long stretches without. Plus I was on high blood pressure meds with diuretics so I became aware, as lovely as having great bladder control seems, that possibly this was a problem. So I quit taking it a month ago & yes things have changed. I must urinate much more frequently and urgently, & I am hoping this is temporary & hope it subsides. But it was proven to me that Spiriva interfered with my bladder signals & I'm hoping there won't be problems later from that.

I can't say Spiriva has been very beneficial on top of my mainstay medication Seretide and Uniphyllin. It seemed to help initially but I now think that was more to do with psychological factors.  I recently went to see a throat specialist about the hoarseness/cough/phlegm issues only to be advised that my medication was not a cause but that I was experiencing reflux, something I have never experienced before I started taking the mediation.

Even though the directions are clear there is no substitute for personal direction. It has been my experience that the nurses, and in some cases the doctors do not take time to explain the do's and don'ts. I had to learn 75% of this on my own. The medicine, however, along with other drugs I am taking are making life much better.",hopeful57

I noticed NO relief.  After about a week of use I was forced to stop it's use and resort to my rescue inhaler (Primatine).  God bless those whom this medication helps but it is not for me. It seems I have had a paradoxical effect.,wolfman7h

This drug has helped to contract the hyperexpansion of my lungs so they can function better and by doing so has taken my functional vital capacity from 30% to 50%. I only take Spiriva nothing else one capsule every morning. I do not know why more doctors are not prescribing it.
