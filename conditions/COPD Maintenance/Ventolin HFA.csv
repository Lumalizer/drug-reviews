0,Ventolin HFA,COPD Maintenance,10,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"May 24, 2019",15,"I am a cancer patient who developed COPD following chemotherapy and radiation.  I use Ventolin for those times I am suddenly short of breath.I’m reviewing Ventolin to respond to several comments that the inhaler stops working before all of the 204 uses have been used.  This was happening to me — several times — and was frustrating: insurance only allows refills every 30 days, and my co-pay is expensive.I took my inoperable Ventolin in and complained to my pharmacist.  The counter indicated 75 uses remaining — I had wasted 10 attempts trying to get medication dispensed.  My pharmacist removed the canister from the dispenser and rinsed the dispenser under very warm water. I let it air dry for ages  She reassembled the inhaler and it worked perfectly!Ventolin has been very important in rescue occasions when I very suddenly and without warning cannot breathe.  This happens so unexpectedly that I don’t go anywhere without my Ventolin inhaler.",Carole
1,Ventolin HFA,COPD Maintenance,6,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"December 28, 2016",18,"My main complaint is that the inhaler seems to be empty before the 200 puffs are used. It seems to help well for the first 150 to 175 puffs, then stops feeling effective. I carefully following how to use it & don't know why I am not getting the right dosage throughout.",mathgirl

4,Ventolin HFA,COPD Maintenance,9,,"January 23, 2009",89,My husband has COPD and our doctor recently changed his albuterol inhaler to Ventolin. His other one was not working like it should. He has been on the Ventolin for about 2 weeks and it works great. He does not have to use it as much and it lasts much longer than his previous one. He loves this inhaler.,Anonymous
