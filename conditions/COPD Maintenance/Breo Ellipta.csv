So many medicine I gave my patients knowing they cause harm and I take medicine that’s horrible for my body. I look in the mirror and don’t even know that person. I used to run track. Very athletic until Drs started giving me medicine.",Mia

4,Breo Ellipta,COPD Maintenance,4.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"January 9, 2020",8,It somewhat works. It does not last a full 24 hours as they claim. Last about 14 hours. I'm going to stop using it because of the price. Way too costly.  They also change the price constantly. Can't wait until all these companies patents run out on long term inhalers so I can get a generic version.,nmcjane
5,Breo Ellipta,COPD Maintenance,10.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"August 23, 2019",13,I am a 57 woman with very early COPD due to smoking for 30 years.  I have been on Breo for 3 months and it has worked great for me!  No shortness of breath while walking like before. I have had leg pain but could be from the statin I'm taking.  I would say the benefits I've received from this drug far out weigh the slight side effects I've experienced.,Patty
6,Breo Ellipta,COPD Maintenance,,,"August 8, 2019",18,"I have chronic asthmaI have been on Breo  for 3 months. I am able to breathe . Not used any ventolin at all. At first I had dizzy spells a couple of times which lasted for a few hours. I was full of energy and so happy that I am able to do my house chores without any issues. After a while  I noticed my scalp itchy and dry.My muscles started to ache, my joints specially. I started to gain weight, hungry all the time. I was becoming tired unable to concentrate.
