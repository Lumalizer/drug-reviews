0,Fluticasone and salmeterol,COPD Maintenance,1.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"December 1, 2021",0,Advair Diskus (fluticasone / salmeterol):I’ve told 3 of my doctors that this medication is a waste of time for me all it does is make me feel like I’m holding my breath with absolutely no help with my breathing my doctor had ordered me trelegy but apparently Humana has a problem with a medication that actually works,Stretch
1,Fluticasone and salmeterol,COPD Maintenance,10.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"November 23, 2021",0,Well I think the medication is working properly the disc that displays the numbers is not functioning properly. This is a problem for me since I depend on the display of the numbers so I can discern what time of day is the dose is needed.,Dee Taylor
2,Fluticasone and salmeterol,COPD Maintenance,1.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"July 17, 2021",1,"Advair Diskus (fluticasone / salmeterol):I started taking this medicine for a COVID cough. After one week of taking it, I started having body aches. Another week passed and I was having chest pressure. It did help with the cough, but then I started having heartburn and was coughing more than when I had COVID. I started to develop Gastrointestinal issues. After eating, I would belch and regurgitation would happen. Heartburn and chest pain was also common. A cough would happen after eating. I went to see a pulmonologist and see told me that I can just stop taking it and that no withdrawal symptoms would happen. That was a lie. After stopping it, cold turkey, I started feeling like absolute rubbish. I started to have diarrhea, abdominal pain, insomnia, anxiety, depression, feeling dizzy and faint-like. She never told me about adrenal insufficiency that could happen after stopping a corticosteroid. It’s been almost 3 months since I stopped the medication and I feel like the symptoms are only getting worse.",Venom1992
3,Fluticasone and salmeterol,COPD Maintenance,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"May 27, 2021",1,"Advair Diskus (fluticasone / salmeterol):The worst inhaler I have ever used,  It has caused side effects of a sore throat, bad cough, congestion, sleeping issues, muscle and bone pain and doesn't work well as an inhaler.  Do NOT recommend. My emergency inhaler works better and lasts longer.",miatagal1
4,Fluticasone and salmeterol,COPD Maintenance,6.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"October 19, 2020",10,"Advair Diskus (fluticasone / salmeterol):Advair Diskus helped my breathing by day two. I loved it at first, other than the cost. By week three my joints started to hurt and by 4th week I was having some real joint pain. After seeing the doctor and stopping the Advair discus the pain stopped within a few days. This has been a problem for me with some other COPD meds but this was by far the worst for pain  for me.",shellie

6,Fluticasone and salmeterol,COPD Maintenance,,,"October 1, 2019",11,"I was doing soooo good on the Advair 500/50 diskus. Well, then , Medicare decides to switch me to the generic form. My O2 stats have dropped drastically. From 97 down to 93 and sometimes much lower like 87. My throat stayed clogged up, as well as my chest is heavy. I'm having muscle tremors as well. My heart shoots up to 128 and higher at times. The generic advair SUCKS BIG TIME. This inferior medicine is NOT the best or even close to the original. In the meantime I still have to struggle to breath. And try to fight this system that's forced upon me, as well as others. SHAME ON ALL OF THOSE INVOLVED. I was on Advair for about 9 years. This generic shit for about 4 months.",Gina
7,Fluticasone and salmeterol,COPD Maintenance,9.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"February 13, 2019",22,"Advair Diskus (fluticasone / salmeterol):Advair does work really well But the disk spray is terrible. This medicine is very expensive, they should work on new container. you have to clean it a ot, and when you do the number of use goes down to 0  when it has plenty in it..then you have to waste medicine using it in the air to see if there is any left.This medicine is so expensive they should look in to fixing the container it comes in..",Joe

10,Fluticasone and salmeterol,COPD Maintenance,9.0,,"December 16, 2017",12,Advair Diskus (fluticasone / salmeterol):I've been on Advair Diskus 250/50 for almost one month since being out of the hospital where I coded from COPD. Needless to say I have quit smoking after 30 years (cold turkey) I can actually breathe & no more wheezing. Only drawback is financially it cost $530 & I now have a thick mucus in the back of my throat that I remember having when I once had pneumonia. My throat stays sore & I am so afraid of coming down with pneumonia. Because of this I am going to try using Advair once a day instead of twice a day. I also have nasal drip all night as well.,Southrn_Granny
11,Fluticasone and salmeterol,COPD Maintenance,,Taken for 10 years or more,"December 13, 2017",8,"Advair Diskus (fluticasone / salmeterol):I first began using Advair after my second two week stay in the hospital for upper respiratory infection. For much of my youth and all of my young adult life up to this point 1997, I had constant shortness of breath and periodic times where I was unable to regulate my breathing without a bronchial inhaler 5, 6 or more times a day. The first time I used Advair I noticed a difference and within days I was breathing like I was 12 years old again. I could not believe the difference. It was night and day. I know that other users may not get the same level of relief, but for me it has been a miracle.",TheDom
12,Fluticasone and salmeterol,COPD Maintenance,9.0,,"November 15, 2017",24,"Advair HFA (fluticasone / salmeterol):I used to take the Advair in Diskus form. I couldn't breath in fast to get enough med so they switched me to the aerosol type Advair. This one works well for me. The thing is, some Drs do not tell you you MUST rinse your entire mouth and gargle after every use. It can cause thrush, which is awful, and voice loss, hoarseness, coughing, and mouth sores too if you leave residue within the mouth or throat. This has a corticosteroid in it so please rinse well! Avoid side effects. It will help you breath because its a beta antagonist blocker or something, which relaxes the lung muscle. Take care of your mouth! I have dentures so I must rinse even MORE but never had thrush in 9 years over it and can breath easier now.",There are no nicknames left!!

It really helped me breathe better and it is a great med for long term control. As my copd progressed, I was unable to get a good breath to inhale from the diskus so my doc changed me to the HFA inhaler form. Advair is great and effective and I sure know when I have run out how much it helps me breathe.",Lpit180
20,Fluticasone and salmeterol,COPD Maintenance,9.0,,"December 15, 2016",33,Advair Diskus (fluticasone / salmeterol):The very next day after starting Advair my life improved dramatically.  I am not kidding....this stuff really works.  I now do 40 min of yoga and a full mile of accelarated aerobic walking (20 min) 5 days a week. After that I immediately grab my oximeter....it is almost always at 97 or 98.  My dr. says am in severe stage and functioning and a level 1.  I don't even use my nebulizer and Aluteral  anymore.  I am 71 yrs old and am being fully honest.,bro3432

My breathing has improved immensely and I can easily walk 3 miles at 4 mph in 45 minutes, each day. My health insurance plan covers the cost; tends to be costly in Canada. I recently discovered that you can buy it in Asia for $20 (marketed as Seretide) rather than paying $175 in Canada. Very effective medication for me!",Stevemb1

I am also diabetic due to being overweight, and not being able to exercise. My FEV is 15%. Advair helps, BUT it has played havoc with my blood sugar. I lost 65 pounds since being diagnosed with type 2 diabetes a year ago. My blood sugar went down to normal levels since I had to  quit taking the Advair (temporarily) due to the high cost. My breathing worsened, so I refilled my Advair, but I my blood sugar went back up over 200. I'm in a dilemma now. The insulin is  $600/month. The Advair is  $200. If I don't take the Advair, I hardly need any insulin. I do take Xopenex/ipratropium via neb, but that doesn't last all day like the Advair. It's part B, so more affordable by far.",Lulubeans

I rated it an 8 only because of the side effect of heartburn, which can be almost intolerable at times.  I can find something to relieve that discomfort! I don't really have much of an appetite (see as a good thing for maintaining blood sugar levels and weight).  I am using in conjunction with another once a day inhaler.

I must say that I have noticed almost a complete turn around with my breathing problems which is wonderful. However, I am in the emergency room almost half of every month due to severe heartburn, gallbladder attacks, severe stomach, throat and esophagus pain. It is all due to the Advair. Have been on all the breathing medicines and Advair works the best. Just don't know if I can keep dealing with all these side effects.",blah36

No way of telling which one is better.  I seem to get a lot of head colds and sinus drainage with both.  Now my MD is putting me back on Advair 250/50, but I doubt it will be effective at all.  I walk 5 miles a day in an hour and 13 minutes.  So if my time improves a little, then maybe it does help more than Symbicort did.",watzknew
