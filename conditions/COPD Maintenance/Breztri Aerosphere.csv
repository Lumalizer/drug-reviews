0,Breztri Aerosphere,COPD Maintenance,10,Taken for less than 1 month,"October 14, 2021",5,"I am very happy with Breztri.  It has helped me tremendously!  Better than any other inhaler I have used.  However, I can no longer afford this medication.  Thanks to my Medicare and Supplemental Insurance, along with Well Care drug insurance, I will not live much longer as they will not pay for this , or any other inhalers I need. Thanks to pharmaceutical Prices ,  I will say goodbye now !",Hope
