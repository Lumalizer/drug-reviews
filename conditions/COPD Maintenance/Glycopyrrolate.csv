0,Glycopyrrolate,COPD Maintenance,8,,"December 27, 2020",6,"Lonhala Magnair (glycopyrrolate):In stage 4 for COPD according to tests and other diagnosis. Lonhala Magnair works well especially at first 6-8 months. Effect seems to lessen over time, however concerning what else is available at this time and when combined with Brovana ,its probably the best of its kind(long lasting ) you can get. All that said........BOTH MEDS ARE RIDICULOUSLY FREEKING EXPENSIVE. I was on a low income subsidy and was able to afford meds, but my wife due to circumstances beyond our control went into AS. Medicare with United Healthcare, so I'm going to loose my LIS. and now due to exceeding threshold, and will not be able to continue the combination treatment. Frankly the actions, rules and guidelines of AS.Medicare have signed my death warrant. I'd sure like to talk to someone in authority about this asanine situation !!!!!!",RMG
