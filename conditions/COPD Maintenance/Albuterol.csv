0,Albuterol,COPD Maintenance,,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"February 20, 2022",0,I asked my doctor if he would let me try Albuterol for my COPD because I could not afford the Spiriva Respimat so he let me try it and I can afford it plus it helps my shortness of breath just as well. So far I am taking 2 puffs every morning like I was with the Spiriva Respimat and so far it’s working for me. I was just wanting to know if it was safe to use it every morning,Punky
1,Albuterol,COPD Maintenance,3.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"November 10, 2020",8,"Teva Albuterol Sulfate Inhalation Aerosol clogs after only a few doses. I've found a can of compressed air is the handiest way to unclog it. Pharmacy refused to acknowledge it's an issue, but this generic's propellant, catalent, is manufactured by the same company that makes Perrigo inhalers, which were recalled in August 2020 for this same problem. I reported the problem to the FDA, but can't get my money back on this defective inhaler. Never had this problem with ProAir inhalers.",niknik
2,Albuterol,COPD Maintenance,2.0,Taken for 5 to 10 years,"October 1, 2020",9,"The Catalent Pharma generic of Albuterol, distributed by Perrigo, is terrible. It should be pulled off the market as you cannot rely on the actuator to not clog even when cleaned per the instructions. This is an emergency inhaler. It should work each and every time. A pliers is required to remove the canister. I can physically feel particles when inhaling it ergo the clogging issue. I called my pharmacy and requested the Teva. That is reliable. Shame on the manufacturer.",Coco
3,Albuterol,COPD Maintenance,1.0,,"September 7, 2020",11,I have been on albuterol for years and it’s always worked effectively until they changed the inhaler device. It does not deliver the medication properly. This inhaler must be banned! It’s dangerous for any one to rely on this and a waste of money !,LJR
4,Albuterol,COPD Maintenance,2.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"September 4, 2020",12,"Ventolin (albuterol):Express scripts gave me the VENTOLIN inhaler instead of PROAIR, the design of the inhaler did not work as well for me. It seems like the  time (1/100th of a second?) that the medication is delivered is too short to ""catch"" during an inhale.I called my doctor and changed back to PROAIR.",Mac
5,Albuterol,COPD Maintenance,2.0,Taken for 10 years or more,"August 31, 2020",14,"I have used ProAir HFA for decades without problem.  For reasons unknown to me I have been switched to Perrigo.  So far I have used four of their actuators.  Of the four, two have been messed up but in different ways.  Both basically stopped functioning slightly more than half-way through the 200 metered dosages.  The actuator is too big and awkward and you can't easily get the canister out for cleaning.  That process actually requires pliers!I hate these and want to go back to what I had before but I'm not sure ProAir HFA is still even being produced!  Who do I ask?   My doctor?  Pharmacist?  Insurance company?",Imp
6,Albuterol,COPD Maintenance,5.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"June 2, 2020",37,"Cannot remove perrigo albuterol sulfate canister from the body of the inhaler, even with a pair of pliers!  Removal of canister is necessary every five days to rinse through the inhaler, or it clogs up and is unusable.  The ""rescue inhaler"" is absolutely essential in management of severe emphysema. . .  HELP!   What can I do until Teva improves the design of their new inhaler?",maria
7,Albuterol,COPD Maintenance,1.0,,"May 28, 2020",31,The first time I used it it stopped dispensing meds after 4 uses.  Took it to Walgreens where the canister was extremely difficult for the pharmacist to get out. She cleaned it and gave it back to me.  3 days later I decided to try this particular canister again.  Nothing was dispensed.  I requested that my physician order only Pro Air.  Went to Walgreens and was given the same awkward useless inhaler.  I’m extremely frustrated with allergy symptoms getting bad.  I’m afraid to go anywhere without taking 2 with me and something to be able to pry out the canister with and hope it works.,Jean
8,Albuterol,COPD Maintenance,5.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"May 21, 2020",23,"I was given the new Perrigo albuterol inhaler by my pharmacy after getting the generic ProAir inhaler. The first Perrigo inhaler stopped working with 44 inhalations left. I decided that it might need to be cleaned. The delivery device has a clear plastic cover over the canister and is not possible to remove without using a screwdriver to pop the clear plastic part off. It is very poorly designed. Once I removed the canister, the delivery device fell apart. I cleaned it but it still did not work properly. The pharmacy once again gave me the same inhaler and I thought I would give it another try. This time it stopped working with 110 inhalations left. I believe this is such a poorly designed inhaler and it can be dangerous for someone who needs immediate relief.",aintjemima

It is terrible.  First, it does not come in a sealed packet, it is just in the box.  Secondly,  the safety cap is not attached to the spray unit and is difficult to remove. Thirdly, the spray is very, very weak.  I have used Ventolin and other versions of Ventolin  in the past and was alway completely satisfied.  This new generic version is terrible!",Erix
12,Albuterol,COPD Maintenance,8.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"February 17, 2020",4,Ventolin seems to work well. I do not do the prescribed amount daily and only use it when I feel shortness of breath or the need to exercise. So far so Good.,Dude

I use Ventolin for those times I am suddenly short of breath.I’m reviewing Ventolin to respond to several comments that the inhaler stops working before all of the 204 uses have been used.  This was happening to me — several times — and was frustrating: insurance only allows refills every 30 days, and my co-pay is expensive.I took my inoperable Ventolin in and complained to my pharmacist.  The counter indicated 75 uses remaining — I had wasted 10 attempts trying to get medication dispensed.  My pharmacist removed the canister from the dispenser and rinsed the dispenser under very warm water. I let it air dry for ages  She reassembled the inhaler and it worked perfectly!Ventolin has been very important in rescue occasions when I very suddenly and without warning cannot breathe.  This happens so unexpectedly that I don’t go anywhere without my Ventolin inhaler.",Carole

The inhaler the pharmacy replaced it with was very ""wet"" and seemed weak and that it stayed mainly in my mouth.
