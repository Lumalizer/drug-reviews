1,Symbicort,COPD Maintenance,1.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"November 28, 2019",13,"ok I could not afford this medicine, so I signed up for free or reduced price on their site, I filled application out and doctor sent in info as well. 3 weeks turned into a month then a month was turning into 2 months. I had called them and ask what the problem was they said everything I sent in was fine, she said she was getting it in order to be reviewed and she would call me back next day, I said are you sure she said ""yes I promise I'll call you back next day"" . I never heard from them.  She never called back, many time I spent up to 6 hrs just waiting on the phone to talk to some one. Next day same thing, over and over again I would call wait up to 5 to 6 hrs for some one to call back ,never got a return call, I believe they just want your info, cause I  can't find any other reason ,",noodles
2,Symbicort,COPD Maintenance,,Taken for less than 1 month,"September 28, 2019",15,"I have been on Symbcort just over a week for COPD and I have not felt this well in a very long time. As soon as I took my first breath after first dose..I felt like I could ""breathe "" again. I have not had to use my albuterol inhaler at all. In fact, I have Peripheral neuropathy and I pray it's not my imagination that my feet even feel better. I hope I do not face side effects, my only concern is my BP but I am not checking for awhile to allow my body to adjust fully in fact if it does up my BP I don't care because I feel better",Miss Maui
3,Symbicort,COPD Maintenance,10.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"October 13, 2018",39,This medication helps me but the cost of this medication is ridiculous. I do not qualify for free prescriptions nor medicaid. I cannot afford insurance and have a family to feed. The cheapest coupon I was able to find was 277.00. Tell me what average american family can actually afford that a month plus other meds? Pharmaceutical Companies  and AstraZeneca are making billions of dollars all the while people are needlessly suffering due to the cost of your medication. That is what I call a crime to humanity.,Bill
4,Symbicort,COPD Maintenance,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"September 30, 2018",40,"I have been diagnosed with a light case of COPD & prescribed Symbicort to help when I exert myself and have shortness of breath. Since taking this inhaler I have been sick with pneumonia like symptoms, hacking phlegm, Charlie horse's in my lower calf, & lacking concentration and confusion with organizing my work.

7,Symbicort,COPD Maintenance,1.0,,"August 31, 2017",34,"I was diagnosed with asthma and COPD and was given symbicort. First I lost my voice , then I would get constant leg cramps at night, then I started to lose weight. I went to see my new doctor, by the way my previous doctor sent me to have my throat examined for any problems and all came out ok. My new doctor asked me ""who told you you got COPD""?  my previous doctor. She asked did I have a lung test and I said no. Then  told me to quit symbicort get a chest x-ray  a full lung test and a complete blood scan which came back Normal. Now it's been over a week since I stopped symbicort and am breathing normal don't cough got my appetite back and don't use my rescue inhaler which I seldom used .

14,Symbicort,COPD Maintenance,10.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"September 27, 2013",85,I have been using Symbicort for 8 months now. It has been a life changer for me. I was using my rescue inhaler at least 4 times a day previous to being put on Symbicort. I have only had to use it twice since starting on it.

16,Symbicort,COPD Maintenance,10.0,,"January 14, 2011",89,This is the greatest thing that's happened in my life in the last year. I used to have to use my Ventlin inhaler 3/4 times a day. I have not used it since I started Symbicort! My last doctor wouldn't even let me try it. Glad I changed doctors. I can go up and down stairs without stopping trying to breath. My child even noticed the difference.,Becj
17,Symbicort,COPD Maintenance,9.0,,"October 31, 2010",96,Had tried Advair and one other inhaler and didn't do anything. Was using albuterol when needed (2-3 times a day). Doctor put me on Symbicort and had immediate relief. Only take 2 puffs in the morning and set for the day. No side effects yet (4 weeks).  Hopefully it will continue to work on my COPD.  ,Paul74
