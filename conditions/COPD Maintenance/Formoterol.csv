3,Formoterol,COPD Maintenance,10,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"November 24, 2012",25,"Foradil Aerolizer (formoterol):This medicine has been a true miracle for me.  I was on multiple medications, oxygen most of the day and night, and taking several nebulizing treatments a day.  Have been on Foradil for two months and only use oxygen when I go to sleep at night, only take 3 nebulizing treatments a day, and have gotten off two of medications completely.  I breathe better and feel better than I have in several years.  I wish I had been given this medication much sooner.  It is truly amazing the difference in the quality of my life that this medication has given me.",gladysw
