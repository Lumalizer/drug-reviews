0,Methotrexate,Rheumatoid Arthritis,1.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"December 27, 2021",0,"This drug has had devastating results for me and I found this drug so scary it should absolutely take off the market. After starting it, not more than two weeks of taking it, I noticed mental instability and immediately stopped. I was never warned about any related major medical complications. All I was told to watch for was psychosis which I’d told them had been an issue w similar drugs. I was never warned about lung toxicity, that RA patients can develop RA-ILA. At the moment I’m waiting to have one final chest CT to compare with one a month ago. I had reoccurring pulmonary complications where I’d been hospitalized, several ER visits. Never told about folic deficiency and even after I had poor liver function my physicians never mentioned that, my low blood cell count or the pulmonary complications being possibly related. Or the GI complications. And why would they? That would acknowledge their liability. I then was giving another med with some same related issues.",Jules021775
1,Methotrexate,Rheumatoid Arthritis,10.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"September 9, 2021",0,"53years old diagnosed in 2010 with RAPrior to taking this was taking Plaquenil 400mg and Prednisone 5mg daily. Had to discontinue the Plaquenil (5-2021) due to constant lower GI bleeding and diarrhea. I've been on MTX 25mg (6×2.5mg) once per week and it is helping. I had been in near constant flares after getting Covid (6-2021) and had so much pain and stiffness that I cried any time I had to move around. Now I only flare once maybe twice a week, or if I over do it. I do have some side effects, fatigue (up two days after dose) but a few short naps help, a little nausea (I found six smaller meals and saltines helped with it.) The biggest one I had was hair loss, during dose week three. My scalp got really itchy and felt really dry and tight, so I wet my hair thinking it was just dry and was just going to wash it after. Nope, about 50% of it fell out as soon as it was wet, which was a bit of a shock, but it's slowly growing back. Small prices to pay to be almost flare free and have mobility back.",Misa
2,Methotrexate,Rheumatoid Arthritis,3.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"September 4, 2021",0,"Methotrexate, 15 mg  injections, Helped tremendously with degeneration of joints,  stiffness and pain but has debilitating profound fatigue. I take 5 mg of folic acid a day and even have added post injection Leucovorin. With no reduction of fatigue, and brain fog/ short term memory loss. Taking  for several months along with prednisone and hydroxychlorquin, I am surprised the company, Pfizer, has not by now found something to help with this.",MDB
3,Methotrexate,Rheumatoid Arthritis,1.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"August 1, 2021",0,My husband was on this drug for about 18 months and it became the worst times of our life.

It helped with less pain, and better movement of my joints.Then he moved and I got a new dr. he said it was just the weather, and I did not have arthritis at all, and stopped my pills.Then about 4-5 months later, joints started hurting, and now I have nodules in my hands, bone spurs in my knees, and hip pain too.I found a new dr. he has put me back on methotrexate and took x-rays of my joints, which the other dr never did labs or xrays, just said I looked like I didn't have arthritis.

6,Methotrexate,Rheumatoid Arthritis,10.0,,"January 24, 2021",102,"Im on methotrexate 2.5 mg four pills 1x a week for around 5-6 years  for RA. I feel good when taking this medicine correctly and on time. I had got sick from taking too many antibiotics for urinary track infection and was told to stop taking methotrexate because I had to take a powerful medicine  to get my health back to normal and methotrexate may interact with that medicine. I went off for almost 1 1/2 months and RA kicked in bad, I was finished with the other medicine  so I went back on methotrexate and the RA subsided. My point is, this medication really does help and never just go off it because you don’t feel any pain anymore, and you think you are cured believe me it’s the medication that’s working, you are not cured you’ll always have  RA. I take mine once a week every Saturday and I feel great, if you skip a dose or 2 believe me ,you will know you skipped it, take it every week same day same time and you’ll feel as though you are cured , and I have had no side affects what so ever.",Ducky
7,Methotrexate,Rheumatoid Arthritis,8.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"January 14, 2021",44,"Started methotrexate in April for RA, pain in hands, knees, hips, fingers and toes. Started on 7.5mg injections but didn't see any difference. Slowly progressed to 15 mg and I'm now just having odd pains here and there, mainly if I've overdone things. Started on folic acid 5mg ever day but it made me feel so ill, now only take it once a week which my rheumatologist is fine with and I feel absolutely fine. No adverse side effects from methotrexate either. Yes my hair is thinner but no so anyone notices, eyelashes a bit sparse now but still there. I was so apprehensive to try this drug but at 45 I didn't want it to progress to the stage where I couldn't live a normal life. I know it's not for everyone but for me it's really helped.",Mel

I'm now about 38 kg Dr are hopeless and I feel like life is dissipating out of me in front of my children.  You can't help yourself on methotrexate as you don't know what you're doing.  It's like auto pilot,  surviving not living and your still in pain.  Better to eat no gluten no dairy no night shades.  Look up what causes inflammation.  Rest, eat well, make love, laugh, dance don't stress have good people around you.  Love yourself.  My daughter lost her first baby at birth two years ago.  Now her mum may go before her grandmother.

I was not light headed or faint just dizziness and not able to function. I was laid up for more than 2 weeks.  Due to   dizziness .  My vital signs were not off, just severe dizziness.

13,Methotrexate,Rheumatoid Arthritis,5.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"December 22, 2019",56,"When I was first diagnosed with RA six years ago, this methotrexate was the first medication that I was prescribed. I was just in so much pain at that time and being newly diagnosed, I just wanted to feel like myself again.  But ... over the course of the first three months, I gained just under 15 pounds. (And to make it worse I was so bloated, even though I was barely eating). Then ... worse yet, about nine months in to my treatment my long hair began to fall out (not in large clumps), but I started noticing my hair was all over everything. Okay, so now I have joint pain, I cannot fit in to my clothes, and my hair is falling out.I was taking this mediation for 14 months before I was changed, and throughout that time I am unable to say it really did anything to help me - although my doctor said it did stop the flare up.  Please note: even though I no longer am on this medication, I did not actually notice this helping with my joints and I do still have flare ups occasionally.",Savannah L

While I was on this I experienced bad headaches, I would bruise easily & badly if I bumped myself somewhere. I also developed lactose intolerance. which I was not until I took this.

The local hospital was treating her for pneumonia but that was not the case. Mom passed away at one of the nations top 10 hospitals from Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome or Adult Respiratory Distress Syndrome. Death Certificate says she died from ARDS and RA. If you love yourself or your loved ones do not let them take this medication. DANGEROUS. She was 52 years old. I can't believe she gone and its all from a little yellow pill she took once a week. Low dose or not doesn't matter. IT CAN KILL YOU. AVOID. Read manufacturer black box warnings and find alternatives. The medicine didn't help much anyway if any.,killedmymom4-16-19

In the past every RA drug seemed to work but immediately affected my liver numbers.  This doesn't affect my liver and works like a charm. Only issue I have now is my insurance pharmacy choice changed and the new methotrexate manufacturer and those  pills don't work. I've been on for a couple of months and am slowly getting worse.

20,Methotrexate,Rheumatoid Arthritis,1.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"July 10, 2019",155,"This is a horrible drug.  I took it once a week for 5 months, 12.5 mgs of awfulness.  My hair started falling out in clumps, even with taking folic acid, the headaches and nausea are debilitating, along with the fatigue and general malaise that I experienced for 2-3 days after taking it.  And it did not touch the flare ups or the pain I experienced from the RA.  I have now completely changed my diet and my way of thinking to combat this disease.  No gluten, no dairy, stress free as much as possible, and supplements like Nordic Fish Oils, Glucosamine and Chondroitin Sulfates and Turmeric help better than the Methotrexate did any day.  I called this drug ""Poison"" the whole time I was taking it.  Now I feel way better not taking and I know why, because it is a POISON.

At hospital 10pm, 1am they said she wouldn't survive? They did EVERY test, bloods/fluids/scans, NOTHING showed. She had lines in neck, drips everywhere, they treated for lots & hoped it worked. But at 5am advised us TURN OFF her life support. Drs were baffled. When they got GP info, & we mentioned methotraxate their faces dropped, they didn't blame meds solely, but they DID explain meds have knock on effect, & with prolonged use they can cause break downs in parts of body. More info should be available, to look out for signs & symptoms about this drug. Please keep getting  checked out. Mum had blood tests monthly & nothing showed, she NEVER missed appointment.

In December my Rheum increased my dose and it was like a switch was turned on.  Within a week, I felt better than I have in years.  I did have a case of ""thrush"" not long after it was increased and a vaginal yeast infection.  I have developed fissures on my tongue but I'm over that - treated - and feeling great.  I do get fatigued the day after I take my dose (I take it twice a week) - but that passes quickly. I've also noticed when my doc gives me a shot, it is not as taxing as taking the pills.  Lucky for me he says I can just get the  shot instead if you want! Having vitamin B12 shots is also the key - I'm doing shots at home - 1/2 dose every two weeks instead of every 4.

25,Methotrexate,Rheumatoid Arthritis,5.0,,"December 28, 2018",109,"I am 32 year old and a mother of two boys working full-time. I was on methotrexate for 2.5 years (10 mg per week oral). It did work and I had little side effects in the beginning. However, about 1-1.5 years in I became extremely fatigued and even depressed.  I  did not feel like myself. I read in other blogs that people had the same feelings  as I did so I was glad I wasn’t alone. I was at a point in my journey where I could try and get off the medication .   After only two weeks off the medication I felt amazing! Back to my old self! Both my husband and I were amazed.  Fatigue gone.  No longer going to bed at 7:30 pm.  No more depression feelings. And thank goodness my RA symptoms have not reappeared.  I do follow a strict dairy free, gluten free, almost pescatarian diet that I believe has a huge impact on RA.  So if anyone is feeling this way please talk to your doctor and try a different approach to tackling your RA if you cannot live with the frustration of the fatigue and depression.",Yay

I have had no symptoms since it kicked in (took a while), the most that will happen because of the medication is the day after I take it I will feel a little tired (was worse in the beginning), anyways please make sure you don’t read reviews and judge the medication from that. I nearly scared myself silly doing that, trust in your rheumatologist and follow the process. The medicine reacts with different people in different ways, I am definitely one of the lucky ones.

I hope in time I will be able to get back to work but I am suffering several side effects. (hair falling out, unusually dry hair, quick to have to rest unlike before and several others) I was completely bed ridden before starting the medication so needless to say I don't want to try anything else because I am scared to take the chance that it won't work at all. I know I'm just beginning and hope in time the side effects will fade.",Jenni bug

He was diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis and began taking methotrexate at 20 mg once a week; he has since cut back to 17.5 mg. It has made a huge difference in his functioning, and he's pretty much back to normal. (Regular strength training at the YMCA has also helped a lot). He was also told to take folic acid once a day, which he does. The only negative is that his hair has thinned quite a bit, which is a common side effect. He is in his 70s.",AnonCat

I started on Plaquenil, which was great, but I developed an allergy to it. Switched to methotrexate oral, but had a hard time tolerating the nausea and diarrhea. Switched to injectable methotrexate, and had no nausea, limited diarrhea. It worked moderately well for the RA. Not completely pain free, but could do most things most days. I got cellulitis while on it, so had to go off for about 3 mos. When I went back to it, it didn't seem to work quite as well, and I realized I was experiencing more side effects than I was aware of the first time: thin skin, dermatitis, bruising, bleeding, hair falling out.
