0,Mycophenolate mofetil,Rheumatoid Arthritis,9,,"July 13, 2021",0,I have been taking Mycophenolate for 3 years. I take 2 x 500 morning and night. I started getting R.A. at age 60 and began destroying my lungs. With a lose of 60% over 3 years my new doctors placed me on Mycophenolate and after 3 years now I am about the same and hopefully stable.,Rex

3,Mycophenolate mofetil,Rheumatoid Arthritis,9,,"October 10, 2009",66,CellCept (mycophenolate mofetil):I have been taking this for about 6 months now and it has greatly reduced the inflammation and pain caused by inflammation of the arthritis. The only complaint I have is that if I take it in the morning as the doctor wants me to (1000mg 2xday) I am drowsy the whole day.,Anonymous
