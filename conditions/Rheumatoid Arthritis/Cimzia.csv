0,Cimzia,Rheumatoid Arthritis,10.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"April 2, 2022",0,Been taking this medication for RA for almost 2 years. It's been amazing I finally have my life back. Was able to breastfeed and be pregnant whilst taking it and have healthy children. The injection pen is easy to administer especially into the stomach. I have no side effects. I found administering into my thigh much more uncomfortable and painful whilst pregnant. Over all 10/10 for me.,U Brady
1,Cimzia,Rheumatoid Arthritis,8.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"February 24, 2022",0,"Was using Cimzia every month for 3 years. Seemed to work except for one knee didn't calm down. Went off Cimzia in Feb and by July I had an avascular necrosis of my right hip, had replacement surgery in Sept and now into Feb of following year and need the left hip replaced. Drs say the Cimzia is most likely the cause of my hip issues.Cimzia works for one issue but then causes another issue.BE CAREFUL WITH THIS MEDICINE FOLKS!",Bolt lady
2,Cimzia,Rheumatoid Arthritis,4.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"November 24, 2021",1,"Used cimzia injection once a month for 3 years in the thigh area. Didn't completely do the job, so switched to another med. About 6 months off Cimzia I developed an AVN and had to have right hip replaced, now 2-1/2 months later the left hip is doing same thing, getting that hip replaced too.Some medical professionals tell me it's the Cimzia that caused the Avascular necrosis (AVN). So folks, please be careful when choosing Cimzia. It caused me more problems than it was worth.",Boltlady

4,Cimzia,Rheumatoid Arthritis,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"September 22, 2021",1,"I have been suggested CIMZIA when I informed my doctor that I plan on having a second kid. I am not really sure if CIMZIA is good or bad. I just had 1st dose of cimzia and have experienced stomach pain, irregular period and constant headaches. I am trying to reach out to the doctor, to know if I should even be continuing this drug and plus to mention other scary side effects they show on google.",Priyanka S
5,Cimzia,Rheumatoid Arthritis,8.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"September 6, 2021",1,"I read some reviews on the drug & wondered if it’s helpful how come some people remain on it 10 years. If there’s no inflammation, why stay on it if it suppresses the immune system this is what scares me with this drug. I am also taking methotrexate so I’m not sure which one is working. I was coughing up blood for over a week & called the doctor office who said cimzia has no side effects so I should call my primary care doctor to get evaluated. Has anyone experienced bleeding while on the medication, weight gain I know is one, and perhaps blurred vision not sure. I have found relief but like I said not sure which drug is responsible.",4 months on
6,Cimzia,Rheumatoid Arthritis,,Taken for less than 1 month,"May 16, 2021",10,"I was to start today I have done other home injections Humira Embral to name a couple for Psoriatic Arthritis the Cimzia needles are huge they do not glide gently into the skin the needle burns and the medication as going in feels like fire under the skin the medication seems to leak, I immediately had a taste in my throat, I couldn’t even finish the first Injection and as I said I am not new to home Injections.Will be calling my Doctor in the morning to let her know this is not a medication I can use.I would not recommend their choice of syringes for home self injection, along with whatever they use that burns so strongly",Dgcraig 1
7,Cimzia,Rheumatoid Arthritis,10.0,Taken for 5 to 10 years,"February 9, 2021",20,"I have been taking Cimza for about 10 years. I tried Enbrel and it worked about 2 months, then went on Humira and it worked for about 6 months. After that I was put on Cimza and have had the very best results for the last 10 years. I pretty much do everything I was doing before RA and it was very bad at one time, my pain was unbearable at onetime.  I have had some weight gain (10-15 lbs) but that is fine with me, my lab work comes back great every time.",David
8,Cimzia,Rheumatoid Arthritis,9.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"November 17, 2020",21,Dmards were not working and Rheumatologist said MTX was too damaging to liver. I was leary of trying biologics because I gain weight with every new drug I try. Cimzia has given me my life back but I have gained 15-20 lbs. I had a gastric sleeve done 3 yrs ago and maintained same weight for 2 yrs. The weight came on from this drug. Cimzia does cause weight gain. Maybe you will or will not gain weight. These bioligics affect your body chemistry and metabolism. I am depressed about it. But I am working on getting the weight off. I heard others say do not bother it will not come off till you stop the medicine. I would rather be pain free and have a stomach roll than crippled and depressed from pain. I have no other side effects from it. The first few starting doses I had a lot of fatigue for a few days. That went away. Good luck. Remember not everyone gains weight. I just know it did it with me in particular.,Porkchop
9,Cimzia,Rheumatoid Arthritis,10.0,,"July 2, 2020",29,"Diagnosed with sero-negative RA after five years of joint replacements and worsening pain and disability. Got with a terrific Rheumatologist. On Hcg, methotrexate and then Cimzia. Been on it for just over a year. Life is almost normal! No pain. No flares. Some belly fat weight gain ( yuck), some hair thinning but that’s about it for side effects. Monthly blood work is perfect. Very thankful everyday for giving me my life back! Pray that this continues.",Lyn
10,Cimzia,Rheumatoid Arthritis,9.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"July 1, 2020",16,"Took 12 weeks  for Cimzia to become effective. Have been on it a year now and experiencing very little stiffness or pain. Only issue is the size of injection, pressure needed to engage it for administration and pain of administration. But only lasts about 15 seconds.I do get fatigue and viral type symptoms but no temperature about 24 hours after taking it.",Anonymous
11,Cimzia,Rheumatoid Arthritis,10.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"May 22, 2020",21,Cimzia was wonderful I had severe rheumatoid arthritis and the flare ups were terrible no side effects and if there were any they were so minimal I didn't notice.  It took effect relatively quickly after loading dose and second dose I was able to do things I hadn't be able to do for a while. My only warning is speak with your drug coverage as mine is apex and I had and awful time. They denied so many claims and my dr ended up having to take me off it and then I was worse than when I started with pain and all the flare ups and had to go thru the reauthorization for an alternative drug they would cover. It was terrible I wish I could have the Cimzia my dr originally prescribed,Anonymous

13,Cimzia,Rheumatoid Arthritis,4.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"March 20, 2020",18,"Hi there! I have been taking Cimzia for almost 4 months now and it has been working great for my RA. I can actually function and get out of bed pain free every morning. BUT after starting it, I now have very scaly, dry skin on my face. It is along my jawline, beside my ears, eyelids, sometimes my forehead, and my upper arms. But the biggest issue is that since starting it, I have not ovulated now for 3 cycles whereas before this, my cycles were like clockwork. One of the main reasons I started this medication was so that I could get off of Methotrexate and start trying to conceive. My doctor put me on it and then has been off because of an injury since and I haven't even had the opportunity to talk to her about what's going on. The nurse that I have with the Cimzia support group doesn't know much. Really starting to freak out because I am a bit older and am hoping the ovulation starts again but I am HIGHLY considering stopping the medication altogether.",JJ
14,Cimzia,Rheumatoid Arthritis,10.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"March 8, 2020",23,"Cimzia has been successful for me.  RA flares reduced to once every 3 or 4 months, and these have occurred with cause (using my hands for heavy work or undergoing a stressful event).  Only possible (not sure to blame Cimzia) side effect has been a recurring minor skin rash that I control with OTC creams.  I receive a monthly injection at my rheumatologist, and would hate to give up this medication!",QueSeraSera
15,Cimzia,Rheumatoid Arthritis,10.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"February 5, 2020",20,"Cimzia put my RA into remission.  Before I started this drug, I thought I would be coping with joint pain for the rest of my life.  Now, I function normally for the most part.    I haven't really experienced any side effects with this medication, except for a bit of weight gain.",JAC
16,Cimzia,Rheumatoid Arthritis,7.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"January 12, 2020",12,I’ve been on Cimzia for about a year with good but not great success.  The injections are very painful.  My recent problem is I am getting a very itchy red rash on my eyelids.  It starts on one eye then moves to the other.  It then goes away and the skin flakes off.  After a week it starts the cycle over again.  Waiting to get into the dermatologist before fully blaming the Cimzia.,Amy
17,Cimzia,Rheumatoid Arthritis,7.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"January 9, 2020",22,"This drug was a god send, my flares finally were at bay, I was even able to go back to lifting with my fiance 3 times a week! Huge downside is that I had a quick burst of Scalp Psoriasis and since then it has spread all over.. will have to unfortunately say goodbye and find another drug as its getting horribly out of control.",Pammmmm
18,Cimzia,Rheumatoid Arthritis,6.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"June 24, 2019",21,"The product Cimzia works OK for my RA, but the company is one of the worst in regards to patient support, I would try others like Humira first prior to starting this.  It should be a last option just  due to the lack of patient support.  I would list all of the areas they are lacking in, but it would take too long.  Other Biologics have their act together with better HUBs and support.",MW

The  side effects are becoming less. The early side effects were fever and pain, even though it is now helping my joint pain. I have high hopes and will continue with this medicine.  I am hoping for less pain and future joint damage",Cloud
20,Cimzia,Rheumatoid Arthritis,10.0,Taken for 5 to 10 years,"February 21, 2019",23,"I use to take Humira and it helped for 2 years, my doc put me on Cimzia around when it first came out. I been on it since 2010 and only 1 problem, my blood pressure goes up. Happens to only 1 out of 100 people, when it starts to wear down my blood pressure returns to normal. I started about 3 yrs ago to only take half dose (one syringe) and that shot will last for 31 days. This is great for me cost wise doing it this way. As far as the psoriasis goes take virgin olive oil 2 TBS every day and good fish oil.",Tibs

I was on Simponi & Enbrel before but they stopped working after a few months and took some time to kick in. The only thing is that all these biologics make my psoriasis come back for some reason.

24,Cimzia,Rheumatoid Arthritis,6.0,,"January 10, 2012",81,"This medicine was initially a God send and my joint problems got better to the point that I was able to cut down on my pain killers.  Side effects included upset stomach and abdominal pain, muscle pain.  Unfortunately I have developed thyroid nodules and my liver has become enlarged and my spleen shrunk - all was well when I had a scan before taking the medicine. Have had to stop the injections and my joint condition has come back with a vengeance. ",laney lintel
