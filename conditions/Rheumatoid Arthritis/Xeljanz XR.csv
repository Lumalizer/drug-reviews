1,Xeljanz XR,Rheumatoid Arthritis,9.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"June 28, 2020",16,"I’ve been on Xeljanz XR for 2.5-3 months now and the difference is night and day. I used to have weekly flares, but now I haven’t had a major flare ever since I started taking it. I still have some low-level pain and stiffness but I am far better off and I now have a quality of life that I was lacking before. It’s so nice to be able to do the things I enjoy again.",jk0117
2,Xeljanz XR,Rheumatoid Arthritis,2.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"January 25, 2020",15,Been taking xeljanz xr for almost 2 years with not much pain relief Plus much back and upper right quadrant pressure. Now I’m taking pills for increased liver counts and high blood pressure and sinus meds to try to breathe. I’ve had shingles outbreak and it’s damaged my nerves in my right pectoral area. It’s impossible to shut out the pounding and ringing in my ears. Insomnia despite sleeping pills. Oh and I gained around 40 pounds without changing my diet clean eating. Tingling hands and feet. Only mild pain relief for a very short time along with all the negative effects. Now I have to take care of my liver and blood pressure along with all the other things that went downhill while on xeljanz xr.,Patriciawildfire
3,Xeljanz XR,Rheumatoid Arthritis,1.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"November 19, 2019",22,"This drug Xeljanz has worked incredibly well,  however, 7 months after taking the medication I was diagnosed the hepatocellular carcinoma (liver cancer) .  It may be a coincidence but the doctors are baffled as to why because I meet none of the criteria.  My liver function tests and bilirubin are all good but I have multiple tumors throughout my liver which, means I am not a candidate for transplant.  This has been a tremendous shock for my entire family.  I have stopped the Xeljanz in hopes that the tumors will stop multiplying and am hopeful the planned treatments get me to a place where transplant is an option.",Sad
4,Xeljanz XR,Rheumatoid Arthritis,2.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"August 12, 2019",17,"I've been on Xeljanx Xr almost 3 months with no relief for my arthritis. Still need to take prednisone (10 mg daily) for pain.  First few weeks were horrible with constant headache, stomach ache. Still get a stomach ache a few hours after taking it.  Cholesterol levels have increased and I have night sweats. I will be switching to a plant-based diet and taking myself off this medication.  I see there are now lawsuits regarding this med...be careful.",mamabear
5,Xeljanz XR,Rheumatoid Arthritis,8.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"January 9, 2019",15,"I've been taking Xeljanz XR for over 3 months and have found much relief from morning stiffness, pain and inflammation.  I almost never need to use prescribed pain medications, I sleep soundly, and am almost back to pre-RA workouts!  I have had to discontinue daily dosages on occasion, due to colds and flu, and I cannot seem to get rid of sinus congestion and discharge, but the trade off is worth it.",Pratt
6,Xeljanz XR,Rheumatoid Arthritis,,Taken for less than 1 month,"August 30, 2018",10,XELIJANZ XR  Gave me my life back. I could tell a difference after taking the first pill.,butterfly
7,Xeljanz XR,Rheumatoid Arthritis,9.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"May 26, 2018",16,"I’ve been taking Xeljanz XR for 5 weeks. So far it is helping me immensely. My pain is 70% decreased and my energy is 70% increased.  This is the best I’ve felt in 7 years. I am cautiously optimistic, so far I haven’t had any negative side effects except I have gained 6 pounds but I think the weight increase has stopped.  I’ve been blessed with a copay card so the expense isn’t an issue. I’m so glad I asked my rheumatologist to prescribe it!",Audene
8,Xeljanz XR,Rheumatoid Arthritis,10.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"March 8, 2018",16,"Since being diagnosed with RA 6 yrs ago, I have tried what seems like every medication & combination with very little to no results. Two years ago, my rheumatologist prescribed Xeljanz in addition to the Plaquenil I was already taking.  I have seen a big difference in the degree of stiffness & pain I’ve endured for so long.  I still have occasional flares which I consider normal but overall I am extremely pleased.  I would do a tv commercial in a heartbeat to recommend it!",Agnes
9,Xeljanz XR,Rheumatoid Arthritis,4.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"September 26, 2017",13,"On my 3rd week with no improvement, increased pain, swelling, and FEVER exponentially increased, (not ""core"" temp just ""hot joints"") decreased energy, frequent headache, and increased depression! I didn't know any of these things could get worse than they already were? But they have! :-( Hanging in there because mine is in every single joint and ""unrelenting"" I don't really have flares cuz mine is constant daily (and nightly) pain, swelling, the fever ",LosingHope111
10,Xeljanz XR,Rheumatoid Arthritis,10.0,,"August 20, 2017",16,"Along with starting XELJANZ XR I've changed my entire diet. Taking on this fight to put myself in remission so that I don't have to live my life with needles, infusions, severe pain, I wanted to find my own path to remove the inflammation, joint pain out of my body. Today has been three successful weeks of living on a plant based diet I've discovered ((it's what we put in our bodies)) that's got us so sick. You must change your diet today. This medication is working! after trying infusions, injections, 7 different pills a day and I still couldn't move, enough of that! This is the best I've ever felt In four years. This medication and diet have changed my life.",BPositive1414
11,Xeljanz XR,Rheumatoid Arthritis,9.0,,"July 16, 2017",10,"I have been on so many different drugs for my RA, this one has been the best one yet.  I do have insurance, but the cost with insurance is still very high ($1000) a month.  My doctors office helped me to help from Xeljanz to pick up the difference.",roxban
12,Xeljanz XR,Rheumatoid Arthritis,10.0,,"May 9, 2017",15,Xeljanz XR is the first medication to truly give me relief.  I has allowed me to live somewhat of a normal life!  None of the biologics worked and methotrexate was a bust with lots of side effects.  I've been on it for 9 months and an very happy.,Nana Me
