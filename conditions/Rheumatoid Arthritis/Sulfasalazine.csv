My medications have run the gamut from A to Z. The last medicine was Humira, which ended up giving me Hodgkins Lymphoma and 6 months of chemotherapy to put it in remission. I am now back to square one and was prescribed Sulfasalazine. A few weeks after taking it I noticed constant nausea, ringing in my ears, hair loss and constipation with no relief for my swollen knees. I am done being a guinea pig for these pharmaceutical companies and am looking at a natural approach using a strict diet, turmeric and other natural compounds to manage this.

I have also been on sulfasalazine for a number of years now.  It has helped to some extent, nothing overwhelming. But better than any of the other drugs.  It has helped with IBS which I have as well. Just before Covid hit I was about to try yet another drug that would lower my immune system, to fight the RA, but held off. Now that I am vaccinated and the Covid numbers are falling I am going to try another drug.  But during this covid year sulfasalazine did keep RA somewhat under control with no side effects.",Horticulture

8,Sulfasalazine,Rheumatoid Arthritis,9.0,,"March 13, 2021",10,"My rheumy, after RA diagnosis in 11/2019, put me on prednisone, then added plaquenil, then sulfasalazine, gradually to 3 tabs 2x day. No side effects. After my joint pain was 75% diminished, my doctor weaned me off the 10mg daily prednisone. Took  3 months. There was a little bit of flare up after each lessening of prednisone dosage but after a few months, nearly every joint felt 90% better. It's been about 1 year since I went off prednisone completely and I've noticed one of my knees has become pain-free and only one has some pain. I also have a little pain in one shoulder but compared to the 20-something joints that had been initially affected I'm happy with this drug cocktail. I believe both drugs are helping me greatly but I'm not sure how efficacious if I only took one and not both. For that reason, I must rate this drug 9/10. I'm very grateful that my doc was able to get me from excruciating pain to nearly normal function. I hope you will all find your magic elixir.",DeeDee

IMHO, there is no such thing as growing pains.  I have been on sulfasalazine for well over five years now.  It does not make me sick, lose my hair, dizzy, or more grumpy then normal...for me anyway.

18,Sulfasalazine,Rheumatoid Arthritis,2.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"December 10, 2019",20,My mum was started on sulfasalazine 4 weeks ago for RA with severe bilateral hand pain and swelling. Initially everything was fine but when the dose was increased in the 2nd week to 500mg twice a day her mood started to deteriorate and developed symptoms of plantar fascitis. She became bed bound and in the fourth week developed flu like symptoms together with rash on the upper torso and feet. Her medication was stopped as the initial worry was that she may have Steven Johnson syndrome.  Luckily it was not this. Her symptoms of plantar fascitis improved since stopping this drug so we suspect it was most likely symptoms due to sulfasalazine. The Rheumatologist now  want to start my mum on methotrexate but at the moment we are holding back and symptoms are being controlled with  prednisone.,JB

20,Sulfasalazine,Rheumatoid Arthritis,3.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"September 11, 2019",25,Update from 2017. My husband is still taking Sulfasalazine after almost three years. Along with the Minocycline. He has no symptoms of RA and no joint damage whatsoever. However after an episode of severe kidney/back pain in the night last week I took him to ER. A CT showed one stone in his right kidney and one stone in his bladder. Kidney stones are a known side effect of Sulfasalazine. He has cut down to two 500mg a day but because he continues to have back spasms and chest pain he has been put on a week of Prednisone. The previous episode in 2017 was actually diagnosed as Anaemia of Chronic Disease and treated with Prednisone. He now has it again. Seriously considering stopping the Sulfasalazine as most of his episodes can be attributed to this drug. Still no other symptoms of RA.,NZNurse28

At about 6 weeks on sulfasalazine, I started getting improvements.  I'm now at 9 weeks and I went all day and barely had any joint pain.  The only thing that sucks is it seems to be making my GERD symptoms a little worse at times still.  I'm hoping that this will gradually decline in the next few weeks though.

Immediately felt dizzy, confused, nosebleed and depression and also severe vision changes. Bi-Weekly blood draws were a total painful waste of time. Then began a very intense ringing in my ears. Discontinued Plaquenil twice a day, and dropped the SZS from 4 per day to 3.  I did get some relief from RA, but far from worth the suffering of the severe side effects. Ringing in my ears continued especially bad in the mornings. Stopped  SZS 2 days ago and ears still ringing like crazy. I hope this stops soon as I am almost crazy with it. Both drugs are very nasty and I will never again take either of these drugs. Appointment with Rheumitologist as soon as the ringing stops. She suggested an appointment with Audiologist to address the tinnitus. I know it is the SZS causing it. Going to try a different treatment, might as well go all the way at this point.

33,Sulfasalazine,Rheumatoid Arthritis,10.0,,"May 14, 2018",58,"After 6 months of symptoms I was diagnosed with RA 5 weeks ago and started this medication immediately. The pain was primarily affecting my feet, ankles, and toes, and I had been totally unable to walk for the whole 6 months. After about 3 weeks I noticed a major improvement. Although I still had pain, the locked-up stiffness was totally gone which meant I could walk again. Today, after 5 weeks, the pain is drastically improved and I hope this continues. Today I went out to see how far I could walk, and I made it 4 kms. I also experienced no side effects coming onto this medication. I would also suggest anyone with RA check out the Paddison program.

In 2017 I began methotrexate and became ill along with neurotin and 2 Tylenol 2 times a day with ear muffs. Now after week 1 of just the sulfa I stop the ear muffs but when I got to week 2 and added the hydrochloriquine I needed the ear muffs again. My head hurts bad, constipated and with hair loss and more pain. So I stopped the hydrochloriquine.  Today I took a pill called Ultimate Immunity  along with Sulfasalizine 2 pills 2 times a day, 1prednisone, 1folic acid.  I make a mustard pack and put under my feet at bed time and 1 fiber capsule no ear muffs.  The moral to this is finding what works for RA and how to treat the side affects.  I put mustard on a paper towel in put in the pit of my feet at night for the headaches. The fiber is for constipation the ultimate immunity is for the immune system and the rest is prescribe for the RA and hair loss I'm 2 months in and LOVING IT.

51,Sulfasalazine,Rheumatoid Arthritis,9.0,,"September 27, 2016",36,"I've been on sulfasalazine for just about 8 months. I started it as they advise--increasing dose each week until up to 4 per day. (for RA) It began working fairly well after a few weeks, however, by the time I got up to the full dose, I began to have a feeling of something stuck in throat-almost unable  croak out a sound.I'm a professional singer/musician, so this was impossible. I immediately cut back, and it got better. I really wanted this to work, it's cheap and one of the safest RA meds.  Anyway, I was able to totally control my RA with 1 sulfasalazine and 2 plaquenil daily.Still hoarse/throat problems, and now fingers are peeling and sore. Time to switch to methotrexate to see if it gets better. :(",rebbie55
52,Sulfasalazine,Rheumatoid Arthritis,6.0,,"June 9, 2016",58,"I have been on these meds for 6 weeks now. Started with one pill a day, then increased weekly to four pills a day. It has greatly helped with my pain. I'm sleeping better at night and especially within the last week, have been able to go about life almost how I did prediagnosis. So for that part - I would recommend giving it a go. As for side effects, I've been fortunate enough to not experience any type of stomach upset or headaches or anything like that. I have however been losing alot of hair. I can run my hand through very lightly, no tugging whatsoever, and end up with about 20 strands. I can run my hand through continually like this and the same thing happens. No pain from pulling, just falling out :( Choosing to tough it out for now",australiankitten

My body would become so stiff, felt like I had pre death rigormortis... especially after sitting for any length of time. Getting up from a sitting position was extremely painful and awkward.  My only complaint about the med is that it is to large for me to swallow.  I take 3 per day, and I am fearful that I will choke on them.  They scrape my throat and esophagus when I take them.  Wish they would change the shape and coat them to make them easier to take.",mygoldens

First four weeks difficult as experienced headache, palpitations and felt exhausted. I also had severe mouth ulcers and required antibiotic therapy. Found increasing tabs weekly too intense so reduced increase to four weekly and found my body tolerated increase better.
