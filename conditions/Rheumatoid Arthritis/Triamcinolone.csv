1,Triamcinolone,Rheumatoid Arthritis,1,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"April 25, 2021",2,"Kenalog-40 (triamcinolone):I'm a 24 year old female and have had RA since I was 8 years old. I had 80mg IM injection in December and within 24 hours my face was red and burning. 5 months later I am still suffering the horrible side effects of this. I constantly have hot flushes, nausea, irregular menstrual cycles, unwanted hair growth. I have no idea if and when these symptoms will subside and completely regret taking it. With regards to my joint information it has eased the pain but I still have residual swelling. My fatigue has also worsened since the injection.",JasmineTrout553
2,Triamcinolone,Rheumatoid Arthritis,1,Taken for less than 1 month,"October 3, 2020",1,"Kenalog-40 (triamcinolone):I had a shoulder injection for chronic pain the next day I went into horrible AFib which lasted 10 days, 2 days after the injection I developed severe headaches with pain behind my left eye then I got so fatigued and could not do anything. I'm still feeling bad 11 days after the injection. My Dr. said these are all side effects of Kenalog I would have refused the injection if I had known of these side effects.  I have had other injections for lower back etc and never had this reaction.",DKC
3,Triamcinolone,Rheumatoid Arthritis,10,Taken for less than 1 month,"October 28, 2019",28,"Kenalog-40 (triamcinolone):I was suffering with rheumatoid arthritis and my quality of life was non existent. I was hopeless. My thigh area and my groin area would burn and feel as if it would snap. I couldn't do anything. Pain management could care less about a person's pain anymore. I was in pain management for 8 years.  An orthopedic surgeon checked me out suggested the injection of kenalog-40 and I have a life now. It's as different as night and day. I had a reaction right after the injection. Felt faint. Broke out in a sweat. It passed. I took some water. I was fine. I have such relief FINALLY. I hope my pain doesn't return. I'm worried about that because it pained me so much. But right now 3 weeks later, I'm way good!!!",Mel
4,Triamcinolone,Rheumatoid Arthritis,1,Taken for less than 1 month,"May 3, 2018",31,Kenalog-40 (triamcinolone):Worse drug I have ever had. I was given a Kenalog injection for arthritis and fibromyalgia. I immediately had my blood pressure go off the chart and developed a rash and rapid heartbeat. I also had trouble breathing and problems with my eyesight. I now have a permanent heart problem. I do NOT recommend this drug for anyone!,Cher
5,Triamcinolone,Rheumatoid Arthritis,9,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"April 18, 2017",4,Aristospan (triamcinolone):It's the only injection that truly helps my son be able to function  as a rambunctious teenager without pain in all his joints. He's had up to 17 injections done at one time for his Poly-particular Juvenile Rheumatoid Arthritis with a short recovery time and pain relief for 3-4 months. I highly recommend asking about getting this injection instead of a short lived Cortisone injection.,Jrounds78
6,Triamcinolone,Rheumatoid Arthritis,10,Taken for less than 1 month,"October 15, 2015",24,"Kenalog-40 (triamcinolone):I went to doctor and told her my left arm was starting to freeze up like the right one did. I have R A for 15 yrs. The next morning I thought a miracle had taken place. Never felt so good for so many years. Went to Costa Rica and after about two months it returned. Came home and after searching for the drug. They had it at the hospital. Took it to my doctor and he gave it to me in right hip. Didn't last but about one month. Next time he gave it to me in my left hip and it maybe lasted 3 weeks. The next time I ask him to give it were my other doctor in Panama city beach,fl gave it to me. In my left arm and it is still lasting. Also noticed how my complexion cleared up. I have rosacea. Once it got in my eyes. You need to get it from a hospital drug store.",sailen4love

I am on second shot and it has been ten days and it's still working. I wake up at 5 every morning feeling refreshed. I look forward to my shot.",steve 007
8,Triamcinolone,Rheumatoid Arthritis,10,,"July 11, 2013",41,"Kenalog-40 (triamcinolone):I have had rheumatoid arthritis now for about 4 years, mainly in my neck and shoulders. I'm a school teacher and it would be excruciating to raise my arms to write on the board. I'm also a musician with allergies. A year ago last spring I decided to get an allergy shot to reduce my allergy symptoms before a performance and was astonished to experience that my rheumatoid arthritis pain literally left my body. I didn't attribute the regression to the Kenalog but while talking to my doctor she made the relationship.  The Kenalog shot for allergies was suppose to be good for a year. A year later my arthritis started to seep back into my neck and shoulders.  I went back to the same allergy doctor and got exactly the same shot and my rheumatoid arthritis symptoms left again. My life has changed tremendously.",Jimjames
9,Triamcinolone,Rheumatoid Arthritis,10,,"February 17, 2009",38,"Kenalog-40 (triamcinolone):I have suffered excrutiating back, hip and knee pain for 15 years.  I had my first injection and felt thirty years old again.  I was able to walk normally and without pain.  The second shot had no noticeable effect and the euphoria from the first faded away.  The first was given very close to the spinal nerve involved.  The second one not so close and today's shot was very close to the nerve.  I would recommend this if medically cleared by all your specialists.  It will change your life, at least for a while.",Sargent Rock
