0,Hydrocodone and acetaminophen,Rheumatoid Arthritis,8.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"March 22, 2022",4,"I was started on hydrocodone with acetaminophen one 325 from Watson Labs.  During flares when aspirin or Alene, Motrin or Advil can’t help ease my flare pain, I’d take my Watson hydrocodone. It would ease me enough I could finally fall asleep and no nausea   It helps me during the more than usual painful days.  Watson Labs hydrocodone worked great for me. Over a year ago, my pharmacy changed brands and I’ve not had a painless time since…only nausea and no relief!  Why?  Can we request or demand the brand that actually helps?",Rhapsodyu
1,Hydrocodone and acetaminophen,Rheumatoid Arthritis,1.0,Taken for 5 to 10 years,"February 24, 2022",8,"Norco (acetaminophen / hydrocodone):I have crippling arthritis, degenerative disk disease and about to have cervical spine surgery with putting in a metal plate Bolts and fusion. I’m also scheduled for knee replacement as soon as possible after cervical surgery. Since they’ve taken the Yellow Norco off the market I’m getting no relief!! With some of the white norco I get maybe a bit of relief but with others no relief at all!! I believe some may have a small amount of hydrocodone but others none!! Surely something could be done. If the ones responsible for this had the pain most of us have I guarantee they’d be doing something about it!!! PLEASE bring the Yellow Norco back!!",Peggy
2,Hydrocodone and acetaminophen,Rheumatoid Arthritis,8.0,Taken for 5 to 10 years,"February 5, 2022",1,"I have RA and fibromyalgia  add to that, a L5-S1 18mm herniated disc with furs involvement and stenosis and you have someone who has to live with chronic, severe pain. Of course, most who have RA develop a higher pain tolerance than someone who suffers an acute pain episode because we deal with constant pain 24/7 and you tend to grow to accept that pain and your brain tends to help you basically hypnotize yourself into a bit of pain relief just as a mechanism of self preservation, however, the pain is still there and it’s still very painful.  You just automatically fool yourself into thinking or accepting it as less.  Having said that, RA patients also contend with flares (flare-ups) which not only has you feeling constant pain, you just get to add to that already constant pain with a total body pain/aching and fever which feels like a bad case of the flu with aching all over along with your already excruciating cronic pain.  So, relief via pain medication is absolutely necessary",Rhapsodyu
3,Hydrocodone and acetaminophen,Rheumatoid Arthritis,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"December 30, 2021",5,"These new White Hydrocodone are terrible, but you already know that, does the companies care?I don't think so. The yellow Hydrocodone worked like they were supposed to work, relieve the pain not make us sick. The white Hydrocodone cost a whole 1/2 of a cent less, Pharmacies do you think that your customers that get sick on this junk are worth keeping as customers? Shame on you. I guess it's more important to keep the stock holders happier.Meanwhile some of your customers are getting sick on this junk, just to save 50 cents. Customer service is getting horrible. When is it enough. Bring back medications that work, not the ones that make us sick. Isn't the point medications to help people. Some folks these white tabs work fine that's cool, but some of us they don't. Why not carry both brands.",Tipped over

I have severe pain in my back, arms, knees and legs from R.A.. Most days I'm crying in severe pain and this terrible hydrocodone does nothing for my pain! It is inhumane to allow this kind  I was prescribed oxy 30 mg & they always helped my pain and was able to work full time. I never took more than 2 to 3 a day. Pain management dr cut my prescription of oxycodone  down and prescribed 4 to 6 of the 10 mg hydro/day. I have been in agony for the past year because of this med not helping me! Now I have severe ringing in my ears that never goes away! I thought maybe I had a tumor & had 3 MRI's to check my ears, my head and my arteries. Mind you I had to pay a 2K deductible. After reading all these other reviews I see I'm not alone. The FDA is obviously in on this charade or they don't just don't care.  There's going to be a huge lawsuit against the FDA when this is uncovered! It IS inhumane 2 let people suffer like this, this is a crime.",Rasheia Rubey

I tried several pharmacies with little to no luck. I've been taking first hydrocodone since mid 1990s and about 5 years ago began Norco 10/325My doctor never had a problem prescribing my meds and had me sign a waiver to continue use. I've been to two different pain clinics over the years and they did no good. I moved to Washington and my new Dr won't provide any pain meds except muscle relaxers which never worked. Now I am forced to buy my meds through the street from my Dr's own patients. So very wrong. What is wrong with this world!!,Fedup

8,Hydrocodone and acetaminophen,Rheumatoid Arthritis,2.0,,"August 26, 2021",1,"I went every month to Walgreen’s for brand name Norco authorized by my pain management doctor.  Walgreen’s requested the drug be sent to their warehouse.  It wasn’t shipped and they didn’t know why.  I called Allergan who made brand name Norco and was told that Allergan sold to another that no longer makes Norco, the original drug before aka the generic versions.  The generics are all bad compared to Norco 10/325 I was taking.  They are full of fillers that cause health problems and less pain relief than Norco.We are in trouble.  Norco and Watson were good pills that worked.  They were very hard compared to generics that are soft showing the difference right away.  I can’t list all the problems with Tris but the original drug decades was Norco and it was far better than any generic I tried.  The worst was Mallincroft that went in the toilet.  We are on our own with generics that don’t work and cause side effects.   First sign of a bad generic is big and soft pills.",Tris

16,Hydrocodone and acetaminophen,Rheumatoid Arthritis,1.0,Taken for 10 years or more,"February 2, 2021",23,I have suffered with the pain of chronic RA for the last ten years. This past month the Walmart pharmacy switched my hydrocodone to the brand Camber. They offer zero pain relief. Honestly I took a baby aspirin they gave me more pain relief that the 10 mg acetaminophen/hydrocodone camber brand. Maybe if these pharmacies pharmacists suffered from RA they would start demanding the manufacturers of these junk generic brands be tested because they cannot have any opioid pain medication in them.

The yellow pills with the V on them are the only ones that work, they are made by Qualitest, which is now Par pharmaceuticals.  None of the big retail pharmacy chains will order them.  I called several local pharmacies until I found one who will order them and keep them in stock for me.  They’re only open 5 days a week and I have to drive about 35-40 minutes round trip to get them, but it’s worth it.

I have tried RP, and Mallinckrodt brand and they do absolutely nothing as far as giving me the overall pain relief.  No real relief as they had before like Watson.  Mallinckrodt used to be good but that was a long time ago.  It’s almost like - might as well take an Aleve and a Tylenol.  Problem with that is I have to take a lot of those often and then my kidneys and liver are hurting.  Trashed my body even more.  Mallinckrodt is better pain relief but nothing much better than Tylenol.  There may be some formula out there to avoid the euphoria effect but without triggering that, it doesn't offer any of the pain benefits.  Kind of like - have to have both or you get an alternative that does not actually work.  But. Then people don't overdose so I get that also...

40,Hydrocodone and acetaminophen,Rheumatoid Arthritis,4.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"February 9, 2019",21,I have charted every acetaminophen/hydrocodone I have taken for the last five years. The relief has always been consistent until the last year when results seemed to vary. I never gave the supplier any notice because the results  were consistent and spectacular for my pain relief. I thought I may have been imagining more recent poor results and after reading other patient reactions in these comments I now suspect my current supplier of quality control issues. I have been using medication made by Aurobindo ( UO3 ). My current pharmacy could not supply another brand so I went to another and got a medication made by Lupin Limited ( n 358 10 ). Just started today but I can't find and comments about this company either good or bad. Hoping it works better than what I have been using. Would like to hear any other feedback.,Mort Lincoln

Everybody complains and pharmacies don't care, Drs and Pharmacist treat all patients bad like they are addicts, even legitimately ill patients. They are truly playing god . FYI, i did my research and found out watson was sued by the state of Mississippi and so sold out to activis and are no longer making watsons.",Chris
42,Hydrocodone and acetaminophen,Rheumatoid Arthritis,3.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"October 27, 2018",28,"Had used Qualitest Brand for years (pink with V and very hard tablet) and would have rated pain relief a 7. CVS will not carry Qualitest anymore and gave me Lupin. I get virtually no relief and they aggravate my ulcer to the point I have to take Carafate. I take them as ordered. At my last doctors appointment, they did a urine screen. NO hydrocodone was found in my urine. I had taken one the night before at 8pm and one at 8am. The test was at 1pm.  The pharmacy has now given me a different brand. Qualitest was recalled for having too much acetomenophin. Myland is now distributing the Qualitest brand. The pharmacist is ordering those to see if it helps. It is absurd there is such a variance in quality and strength. We will see how this goes!",Savannah
43,Hydrocodone and acetaminophen,Rheumatoid Arthritis,5.0,Taken for 5 to 10 years,"September 18, 2018",38,"The hydrocodone made by Mallinckrodt Pharmaceuticals is a much weaker version of the one made by Watson. Be aware when taking this medication that many generics do not assist with pain the same way as other brands. I have found the main difference is pain relief. Where as I take one Watson made hydrocodone it equals the effectiveness of 1 1/2 Mallinckrodt Pharmaceuticals made hydrocodone (M366). I know from research companies make medications with different ingredients etc, and I would recommend to anyone that if you are taking this medication (hydrocodone) you splurge a little on your wallet and ask for the Watson made brand. It is more effective, lasts longer, and doesn't give you headaches. Please also never take this med to get ""high"" it causes regulations that make us true pain sufferers suffer more to curb your addictions and criminal behaviour. Ty.",crunchyyellowlion

I have arthritis and consecutive tissue disorder. As a child I tried to play but got tired and too painful to stay up for long periods of time. I stayed in bed a lot. I tried to ride bikes with my friends as a teen but struggled. Until a Dr put me on pain meds in my 40s that I felt relief for the first time. Now the medical field is trying to reverse back. They need to hear the other side of the people that have been helped. It is not our fault if people are misusing their medication. I really do not believe this is the cause of the epidemic. Drunk drivers are caused by drinking too much and driving. If you don't over drink and you don't drive while drinking then there's no issue. Same thing here. I truly had no life before this pain medicine,Dee

51,Hydrocodone and acetaminophen,Rheumatoid Arthritis,3.0,,"January 25, 2017",36,I have been taking the Watson brand for over ten years and it helped me tremendously with my RA pain. Now I am having to resort to this pill bc NO PHARMACY will order the Watson brand! Why is this? Does any one know bc this pill does not touch the pain like the Watson brand. I hope I am not the only one that thinks this pill doesn't work as well... Is it the chemical make-up bc I was told generic is just the same... To me it's not! One pharmacy does carry the Watson brand but does not take my insurance so I have to pay full price! In my opinion this is why we have these pills being sold on the streets bc people who actually needs them cannot get them in pharmacies! Any one have an opinion on this?,Any opinions?
