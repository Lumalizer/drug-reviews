0,Imuran,Rheumatoid Arthritis,5,Taken for less than 1 month,"January 6, 2022",1,"I've been taking Imuran for 2 weeks now to treat my inflammatory arthritis since no other drug seemed to help. I haven't noticed any improvement yet, but the nausea is unbearable. I'm not able to eat anything and I'm constantly hungry. Reminds me of my pregnancy morning sickness, though it's not as bad as methotrexate was. I've already lost a bit of weight due to this. Yesterday, started taking anti-nausea medication to be able to cope. I hope the side effects end soon and the drug helps treat my symptoms.",Camilla
1,Imuran,Rheumatoid Arthritis,1,Taken for less than 1 month,"May 24, 2018",19,"I was put on Imuran for RA and RA-ILD ( Rheumatoid arthritis, Interstitial lung disease).As another mentioned, this drug is not widely used for RA nor is it widely accepted as a treatment for ILD caused by RA.  My docs are hoping to cover both bases with one drug.  So far the side effects are monstrous.Willing to go back on a 'regularly prescribed' RA med and hope for the best in the lung flare ups.",Soho79
2,Imuran,Rheumatoid Arthritis,1,,"February 18, 2016",36,"The first two-three weeks were fine.   Then I started experiencing a bad headache, the next two days fever and chills.    The next evening, severe chills, weakness, dizziness, raging fever (up to 104.3) and began throwing up.    It was the worst I've ever felt in my life (and that includes a hospitalization in ICU when first diagnosed).    I was on the verge of calling 911.   However, it eventually passed (as the medicine worked its way out of my system) and the fever subsided.   My Rheumatologist ran a complete series of blood work and she said that I had an allergic reaction.   Prior to starting Imuran, I had been tested for liver compatibility and the results showed that I would have no issues so I proceeded.  Proceed w/extreme caution.",MI mom
