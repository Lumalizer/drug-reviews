0,Hydroxychloroquine,Rheumatoid Arthritis,3.0,,"March 22, 2022",0,"I was diagnosed with RA a year ago.  And been on this drug for a year now and haven't felt any improvement. I've noticed many of you have been on it for many years and noticed a remarkable improvement.  Maybe I have to give it more years to see and feel improvements? Or give it a few more years, cause it's not doing any wonders so far on my joints. It's my fingers, shoulders and knees, it's really strange. I guess working at the Home Depot doesn't help either.  I may have to change my position or job",Susan
1,Hydroxychloroquine,Rheumatoid Arthritis,2.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"March 13, 2022",0,"Plaquenil (hydroxychloroquine):I developed sudden paralysis in my right leg about a year ago.  After being hospitalized, and subjected to a variety of medications, my condition deteriorated until I needed a walker to even stand up - and was only staying awake about 3 hours per day. Finally,   I asked to be tested for RA. Very positive results. On my first visit to the rheumatologist, she prescribed hydroxychloroquine.   I had reacted severely to other medications, so I started with 1/2 prescribed dose - one 100 mg pill with supper daily.  Within two days, I could stand and walk independently for short distances.  Within a week, I was walking and driving and staying awake throughout the day.  This was like a wonder drug...and then I started to get serious cramps in my intercostal muscles so that I felt that I was being crushed and could not breath.  I ceased to be able to feel my hands and feet.  It took over two months for this to stop after quitting the pills, and I still show some liver/kidney damage.",bjaques

I haven't had any side effects at all. All I know is this. My disease is better . These reasons make me a fan of the drug. If you stop this drug your disease can get worse.

3,Hydroxychloroquine,Rheumatoid Arthritis,1.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"October 20, 2021",0,"I am a 74 year old female that was diagnosed with RA and some other auto immune disease that I can't pronounce, 3 months ago. Was put on Plaquenil 400mg once a day which I decided into 2 doses, one in the am and one in the pm with food. I had such stomach pain, abdominal pain with cramps and nausea all day, which I thought was my IBS. And yes my IBS had kicked in because of this medication and actually made far worse to the point that I had to see my gastro doctor to get tested for stuff which all returned negative. Got off of the Plaquenil and everything went away about 2 weeks later. Waited 14 days and started again to see if it truly was this medication, and bingo, the same thing happened. I tried it later again with just 200mg because I didn't want to give up, but it did the same thing again as it did with 400mg. It also made my hair fall out and made my joints hurt worse and caused muscle pain. Go figure. I am off it now, it's not for me.",Gabbs

5,Hydroxychloroquine,Rheumatoid Arthritis,,Taken for less than 1 month,"August 17, 2021",2,"In 2019, Several weeks after starting my first RA drug (diagnosis delayed +10 years apparently) I began hydroxychloroquine and felt no side effects. At the same time, I had a too-fast heartbeat (thyroid related) and my cardiologist did my routine 3-month EKG to follow-up.  We were very surprised the EKG showed a long-QT abnormal heart rhythm for the first time!  Long-QT sufferers can do fine but sudden death from sudden heart stoppage is also possible (my layman’s terms). Since hydroxy can cause long-QT problems, the cardiologist advised stopping it immediately.  I did after rheumy agreed.  Luckily, 3 months later a new EKG showed my heart back to normal rhythm.  If I hadn’t had my routine EKG, the long-QT could’ve gotten worse and who knows what could have happened.  So hydroxy. users should consider a screening EKG to protect themselves (I had no heart problems other than my rapid heart rate due to poor thyroid disease treatments).  I am lucky I got the EKG!",TxMom

When I sleep I have VERY weird, detailed, and realistic dreams bordering on nightmares in a few cases, but just bizarre in the majority of cases. The dreams are so weird I don't share the details with anyone like I used to do. Last night's dream had me partially conscious and at one point I raised my arm to defend myself from an attacker (in the dream) and I was aware of doing it. Weird, huh?

I started taking Plaquenil in 1987.  I was on gold shots and an NSAID and not doing well at all.  A Rheumatologist put me on Plaquenil.  He said if I didn't get enough relief, they would put me on a new drug called Methotrexate.  I had some improvement with Plaquenil, but 2 years later they did put me on Methotrexate.  At one time I was on those 2 drugs, plus Sulfasalazine & Orencia.  It was changing my diet that got me off of those other drugs, but I still need to be on the Methotrexate & Plaquenil.  I feel pretty good, but I still have flareups occasionally.  I have had no side effects from the Plaquenil.
