0,Aleve,Rheumatoid Arthritis,10,,"January 31, 2021",7,When I have a severe onset of arthritis pain I take an Aleve. After about an hour I begin to feel relief and can start moving again. It has been a great product for me.,CJ
1,Aleve,Rheumatoid Arthritis,9,,"December 15, 2016",18,"I have R.A and I was skeptical at first but I was in so much pain in my wrist and hand I wanted to scream. Well I took a 250 mg Aleve and it took 2 hours to kick in but I must say thank goodness for Aleve. I still feel a small amount of discomfort but its nothing that will interfere with my day, I recommend this. Normally I take Tylenol but I think I like Aleve better. My first time taking it. Put it this way it won't hurt to try and I'm glad I did.",Mona Lisa

I am 34 and in good health and have never had swollen feet. I then noticed the next day my feet and hands were swollen. I finally put 2 and 2 together and realized I was allergic to the Aleve. I stopped taking it and haven't had swelling since.",Anonymous

Although I experience severe body and joint pains on a daily basis I take one Aleve on the days I work and can put in 4 to 6 hours pain free.  I have not suffered any side effects so far.  So far none of the other medicines I have tried have been as effective as Aleve.,jadou
