0,Xeljanz,Rheumatoid Arthritis,7.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"September 20, 2021",1,"When I started taking Xeljanz I was also on Methotrexate and hydroxychloriquin (Plaquenil). I was having GREAT results! My doctor had me slowly taper off the Plaquenil and Methotrexate and I was still doing really well. BUT, then came Covid-19 and I was told to stop the Xeljanz for two weeks prior and following my vaccinations (Moderna two shot vaccine). So, I was off Xeljanz  for two months. The pain that returned was so severe. Once I could restart the Xeljanz my doctor also put me on low dose Prednisone to speed up my recovery. However, it's been 5 months back on Xeljanz and I'm only getting very, VERY minimal  relief from my pain. It seems that being off Xeljanz for those two months caused my body to not react the same as before. It's very frustrating. I hope my doctor can figure out a new way forward soon. PS- I had no known side effects from taking Xeljanz .",Elspeth

I started Xeljanz after trying methotrexate(pill form) and Enbrel (injectable). I’m trying to find an arthritis medication that is in a pill form rather than injection. I was only on Xeljanz for about 4 months and did not have any noticeable improvement. What did happen was my face broke out in what appeared to be acne. Before this medication I never had issues with my skin, never had to use any special products. At first I thought it was due to having to wear a face mask 10hours a day at my job(due to covid) but as soon as I stopped the xeljanz my skin went back to normal. I was really disappointed as methotrexate did a similar thing to my skin but not as bad. Now I am trying Arava and hoping for the best.",Pepper

I was on this drug and was promised the doctor only had one failure? Did that mean death? I have a history of heart disease on both sides of my family. Within one week my blood pressure was up by more than 20 points, I had palpitations, and was sick all the time due to stomach complaints. This is one of many RA ""drugs"" I have tried with limited to no effect except worsening pre-existing conditions. Get a CLUE doctors. Prescribing steroids like prednisone which only lead to further bone degeneration in a population with this problem? Doctors do not know WHAT they are doing. Remember, there is NO CURE for RA. Do not trust your DR. That is my advice. They do not have time to deal with you, they have patients booked back to back due to insurance. You are lucky if they really know your name without your chart or nurse telling them. ",RAWoman123
