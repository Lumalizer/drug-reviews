4,Methylprednisolone,Rheumatoid Arthritis,10,Taken for less than 1 month,"December 10, 2017",5,"I have both fibro and lupus. I injured my hip bone and was in severe pain, worse than the pain I'm in on a daily basis. Lately the pain has kept me debilitated and depressed. In addition to the prior mentioned I haven't been eating, loss of hunger and gastrointestinal issues. My PC Dr placed me on this medication. The first day I wasn't sure what to expect. I can tell you that I did get hyper. With that said, this was the first time I was able eat.  Then I found that I was joking around with my family. Day 2: I ATE,  3 meals! Still needed pain medication but not as much because the ibuprofen and extra strength Tylenol  were allowed to work. I was able to move.  Day 3: I ATE AGAIN!! I took advantage of everything I could. I feel alive!",Lizl58504

7,Methylprednisolone,Rheumatoid Arthritis,1,,"April 7, 2017",7,"I have been taking methylprednisolone on and off for years. Yet every doctor that gives it to me always says ""now we don't want to stay on this too long because it has side effects"". Well, that's like saying don't drink poison u might get a stomach ache. Out of about forty side effects I had at least ten, and the most painful.  Not realizing the cause the more pills I took, the worse the pain got.

The best result was Methotrexate but unfortunately after a bout of pneumonia this was stopped. I was at my wits end and lost interest in everything.....even the news that I was going to be a grandma! My rheumatologist, seeing my distress gave me the injection and its like a new world! I have the odd 'ouch' but I can now sleep, my memory is back, I can smile and mean it. Don't know how long it will last but for me its been a bit of a lifesaver.",Natawol

11,Methylprednisolone,Rheumatoid Arthritis,9,,"August 15, 2009",44,"This medicine worked great! I could walk, jump, run, and do all the things any other teen could do. The negative parts of this medicine include weight gain, headaches, and other serious things like glaucoma (the reason I had to get off, so please get eye exams when on this). The hardest part is getting off after you've been on it for a while. I flared up to the point where I was back to square 1. Also, never miss a dose. Despite all of that, most people don't have those side effects and it does seem to be effective even in the long run. It's also relatively cheap and definitely worth a try.",Anonymous
12,Methylprednisolone,Rheumatoid Arthritis,10,,"April 3, 2009",31,"Methylprednisolone (medrol) has far fewer side effects than most other steroids. It still, though, has increased appetite, especially when not taken steadily, so be aware of how much food you consume. It is a highly effective systemic steroid and requires 20% less to achieve the same effects mg for mg than prednisone. It is, however, weak compared to dexamethasone (decadron).",Anonymous
