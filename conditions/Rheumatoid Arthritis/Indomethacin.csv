2,Indomethacin,Rheumatoid Arthritis,8,,"October 10, 2009",49,Indocin (indomethacin):Before taking Indocin aches and pain are felt throughout my joints. When I take it at night I sleep better and the following day I feel the pain is diminished by 60% or better. I stop taking them after 3 to 4 days and start when the pain gets unbearable.,FM2
