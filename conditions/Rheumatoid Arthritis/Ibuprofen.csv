5,Ibuprofen,Rheumatoid Arthritis,10.0,,"April 23, 2008",55,Advil Liqui-Gels (ibuprofen):Absolutely could not have survived the pain and inflammation without this drug.  It is gentle and safe enough to take 800mg with food. The liquid gels seem to work (gets into my system) much quicker than just plain ibuprofen.,Anonymous
