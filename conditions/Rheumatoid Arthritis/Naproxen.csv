But then the side effects kicked in. Nauseated, dizzy, lethargic, black stool, vomiting, headaches and horrible neck pain. I am done with these pills. I am going back to Advil. That also worked for me. Even after both my hip replacements.",Atn
1,Naproxen,Rheumatoid Arthritis,10.0,,"January 31, 2021",7,Aleve (naproxen):When I have a severe onset of arthritis pain I take an Aleve. After about an hour I begin to feel relief and can start moving again. It has been a great product for me.,CJ

I now have had to stop this medication  due to stomach issues. Pain in the stomach and Tar like stools (gastric bleed?). So it os  back to the Doctor to seek an alternative medicine.",Julio
3,Naproxen,Rheumatoid Arthritis,9.0,,"August 26, 2018",22,"I have had rheumatoid arthritis for over 25 years. I have always found that if I take only 200 mg naproxen or ibuprofen with water and some food an hour before going to bed, I have very little morning stiffness in my hands or feet. It makes a world of difference to me taking it before bed time.",Annie

6,Naproxen,Rheumatoid Arthritis,4.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"January 5, 2017",14,"I took Naproxen for a week without taking Omeprazole.  The doctor had said I should only take the Omeprazole if needed. By the time I needed it , the damage had been done.  I had chronic gastritis (inflammation of the stomach lining) caused by the Naproxen. You must take both at the same time. I was in agony.",downhillafter50
7,Naproxen,Rheumatoid Arthritis,9.0,,"December 15, 2016",18,"Aleve (naproxen):I have R.A and I was skeptical at first but I was in so much pain in my wrist and hand I wanted to scream. Well I took a 250 mg Aleve and it took 2 hours to kick in but I must say thank goodness for Aleve. I still feel a small amount of discomfort but its nothing that will interfere with my day, I recommend this. Normally I take Tylenol but I think I like Aleve better. My first time taking it. Put it this way it won't hurt to try and I'm glad I did.",Mona Lisa

13,Naproxen,Rheumatoid Arthritis,5.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"November 8, 2013",21,This pill is a super strength Rx form of Aleve. If you have chronic pain it's good for inflammation of the joints that narcotic meds just cover up. Take them for breakthrough pain prn with food. They can be hard on your tummy like Tylenol type meds. I've lived with severe pain since 1989. In 2003 I was crushed between my back bumper of my car after running outta gas and the front grill of a Blazer SUV. My left leg was degloved. After a long hospital stay and many surgeries they saved my leg by reconstruction. I finally found a pain management Dr after jumping thru lots of hoops. I always fear loosing my meds before. I get where I no longer needs. them one day ( I hope). Good luck to those that aren't so fortunate as to find a compassionate Dr.,katz_trippin

It was found out that Naproxen was the cause. I will have to find another medicine to help with my rheumatoid arthritis. I was not aware of the side effects.  I believe that this information should be more and more publicized. ,owlcollector

They definitely helped the day get better and be able to function daily.  However, they did not stop the morning stiffness and pain or the build up of inflamation in my body.

24,Naproxen,Rheumatoid Arthritis,,,"September 19, 2008",33,I recently had my meniscus removed from my knee and am now dealing with arthritis in the knee which is hampering my recovery. I started on naproxen and didn't realize how helpful it's been until I switched to a cream version. Within a day I was in constant pain and could not exercise at all.  I went back on the pill form and was back walking nearly normal before the 2nd dose.,Anonymous
