I have 2 infusions every four months , 15 days apart, reduced from originally every six months.  The speed that it takes to get into my system required a shorter space of time between sections.  The only side effect I have is not sleeping the night after the infusion.  I know it’s working as I can feel when I am nearing the end of the medicine gets near.

In 2000, I started infusions. Remicade for 14 years and then just stopped working. Tried Orencia for three months - never worked. Rheumatologist put me on Actrema - some success for about 18 months and then it quit working altogether.  In 2016, my Rheumatologist put me on Rituxan. I’m on a 16-week/2 week cycle. It’s been a great. I sometimes have trouble sleeping the night of my infusion (due to Solumedrol I have to take with it) and then really fatigued for a couple of days after - but I’ll take it. My joints seldom hurt, never swell - I generally feel fine.

Some fatigue occasionally but no joint pain. After retirement, the combination of allergy to a new huge Maine Coon cat causing chronic congestion AND the suppression of my autoimmune system by years of Rituxan - led to repeated chest, ear and sinus infections. After many tests, allergy shots and several consultations with specialists, the Rituxan was discontinued. Now (2 years later) no more infections but the RA is up and raging again. New hand and finger damage as well as bunions and flares on toes that had never occurred before. My doctor is waiting for a fifth Simponi infusion in 2-3 weeks before moving on to another drug.

This is my eighth drug in four years as NOTHING has worked at all and the side effects were a horror   show.  Do far I have used hydroxychloroquine, sulfasalazine, methotrexate,   Arava, Inflectra, Xeljanz, Kevzara. After my first infusion with rituximab on Dec 12 I had three days of pure bliss. I was in remission...or so I thought. I was pain free for the first time in 4 years .The evening of the third day the pain in my left hip  started back and got worse daily. After waiting 4 weeks for the second infusion, I had three hours of relief on the second day after treatment. Since then it has been straight downhill with the pain going back into my knee.

This time it worked after about 7 weeks and has continued to work really well - it's now Jan 2019 and I'm still fine... amazing..... my consultant was totally right! I'm due my third round of infusions this week and am no longer in fear of the med not working. It is really good - after 14 years of RA treatments I would say this is my best med. No methotrexate needed. I've not had any side effects - I haven't even caught any more colds than anybody else! If thinking of trying out this med be patient and good luck - it might give you your life back! Incidentally, it also cured my husband's lymphoma when he was given R- Chop (cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone plus Rituxan) medication.... so we've a lot to thank the NHS and the scientists who developed this med for! x",Linz

I went 2 weeks later for the second infusion & continue to feel no pain.  No side effects so far.  Finally got off steroids.  I did feel very tired last night, a first.

Worsening symptoms have led to Rituxan infusions. I experienced throat pain/itching along with itching of my ears and then scalp itching.

After the first round, my condition seemed to worsen. I dreaded going to bed at night because of the pain I know the night will bring. I could barely walk, lost function of my hands/wrists, couldn’t raise arms, and my neck movement was limited. After my second round, which has been 6 days ago, I’ve seen slight improvements. Pain, swelling and stiffness has seemed to move to different joints. Still hopeful it will work. I have tried Enbrel, cimzia, and xeljanz which brought relief, just not lasting.

First one was very uncomfortable, I can’t take any steroids (very allergic) so I rely on Benadryl IV. I had a mild reaction toward the end, felt bad for days. Went 2 weeks later, same thing.  I thought, I’m not doing this if I’m going to feel rubbish for 2 weeks. Almost exactly 4 months later, I started feeling all the fun stuff that had gone with RA.  I had forgotten how I typically felt.  It worked very quickly on me, and has only gotten better.  I went to my doc, she said, you’re a 4 month person. Personally, retuxin was the starting point of a complete life shift.  I felt better, which gave me energy, which allowed me to slowly start going to the gym, which goes hand in hand with eating clean.  It has been a life changing medication for me.",SRR

While most patients receive concomitant methotrexate therapy, I do not, due to liver damage from previous methotrexate use.  Rituxan has improved my quality of life physically, mentally, emotionally.  My advanced RA will never allow me to live ""normally"" but I am the best me I can be with this treatment.

The second one two weeks later went without incident, about 4 hours.Five months later, I have been able to reduce my prednisone intake without a flare up of RA, and the nerve pain from the vasculitis has remarkably dwindled from lasting and unbearable to very manageable.  It doesn't reverse damage, but my sed rate is around 11 (from 30) and if I didn't have to worry so much about the ghastly cost of this med, at this point I have to say it's been most amazing.

Have only had the two original infusions so I can't say what it will do long term.
