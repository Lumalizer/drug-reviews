0,Humira,Rheumatoid Arthritis,3.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"March 9, 2022",1,"I have had 3 injections so far and am going to quit. The last one was yesterday. My reason for quitting is that I sense I am getting depressed, even though I take antidepressants and have for years. This seems to interact with the meds I already take, and I don't like the way I feel. It certainly helps the RA; my hands are so much better. But I would rather have my mental and emotional health back.",PhxBarb
1,Humira,Rheumatoid Arthritis,10.0,Taken for 10 years or more,"February 16, 2022",0,"I have been on Humira since 2007, 14 years and 4 months. It took over 2 years for me to be diagnosed with RA. I went from a jogger, hiker, waterskier to someone who could barely walk from my car into my office building, needed both hands to turn my car key in the ignition due to pain, swollen and painful fingers and feet. Felt like I hardly had a life. After 6 months on Methotrexate, my doctor put me on Humira. Within a few months I was back to running, hiking in the mountains, and water-skiing- I had my life back! I am rarely ill, and have only had one bad sinus infection in the years on Humira. It's worked very well for me.",Kathy

I've been on it 5 months for RA I have a rash at the injection sight, and swelling burns a little too, just like a bee sting. But this doesn't bother me.

3,Humira,Rheumatoid Arthritis,3.0,,"December 27, 2021",0,"Absolutely unexplainable, horrid, complications however after reading thru their warnings and drug interactions the experiences have everything to do with my prescribing rheumatologist being negligent and not the drug itself. I had many very severe side effects because despite fully knowing other conditions I was on, and even some meds with moderate interaction this should never have even been considered an even possible treatment for me. None of this was disclosed to me with the exception that I’d be more prone to infections however while it was made clear it really wasn’t explained well or as possibly serious as it could be. The one thing that had prompted me to even question my now fired rheumatologists was by using the drugs.com app I keep track of all my meds in and when I entered humira immediately a major health hazard indicated not just one warning but two. Both of which I know they were more than aware of. Coupled with the fact they were also negligent with my first medication.",Jules021775

Was on methotrexate, but did not control RA well and kept having to have joint replacements. So prescribed Humira, first inection, was okay, did not see any effect, but was told it had to build up. Second injection the next week. The next morning I woke up in trouble! TERRIBLE..rash, facial mask, hives/itching, sores in mouth and throat /eyes. Taken off Humira and told I had a ""lupus like"" syndrome. Was on steroids for months as it stayed in my system for three months before the lupus episode was over. Humira said once it was out of my system, it would be okay (still get hives off and on). I believe it is likely, now reading literature, that PEG (those lipid nanoparticles) in the injection might have been a cause, but no one knows for sure. BAD drug in my case.",JEC

Due to the PF,  doctors were reluctant to try biological drugs. I did try Orencia, but had side effects.  Was placed on Enbrel, but no Relief.  I finally got Humira. I took the first dose and felt strange the next day; panicked.  By the next day my life was in utter chaos! I did find that if you're on Benzos, it blocks them, so I was in total withdrawal!!!

15,Humira,Rheumatoid Arthritis,5.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"April 6, 2019",27,"Diagnosed with RA at 22yrs. Started with Plaquenil, it helped for a year then we added methotrexate. Took some time to get the dose right due to nausea. That combo helped for about 2 years. Then added Enbrel. Added Meloxicam. Prednisone as needed for the worst flareups. After serious ulcers I stopped the meloxicam and prednisone as they both increase changes of getting ulcers. Enbrel only worked for 1.5yrs. Just switched to Humira, still taking plaquenil and methotrexate. I prefer the syringes to the pens. Some relief in the first week, hoping it works for more than a year or two. Many illnesses due to the compromised immune system, and extreme fatigue, but my RA is so severe I am fully disabled without these meds.  I hope I can find one that will last a little longer.

Not the healthiest eater, notice when I do eat healthy major differences in effects. Take medications every Saturday night to sleep off pain. When I didn't care about diet I felt extreme effects of a headache and pain in the stomach. Noticed that if I eat a lot of food that day my effects aren't bad. Watch your diet !! With Humira the first few months I noticed pain went away. Was so happy, now I think that it isn't helping anymore. Feet still ache because of cold weather but the first few months I had no pain. I read reviews and the mention of tinnitus comes a lot. I thought ears may ring/hum because wearing earbuds but starting to believe that it may be caused by Humira.

Previously I'd been on Prednisone, which helped the pain but had horrible side effects, and methotrexate, which didn't help and had horrible side effects. Humira has been a life safer. The shot itself definitely stings, especially in the thigh, but I went from constant pain, a severe limp, and inability to do much of anything to basically a slightly less flexible but otherwise normal able-bodied person. No side effects have yet appeared. I don't know how I managed without it for so long.

I just had my 3rd dose (every other week). Other than the extreme pain during the shot and a bit unsettled for about 10 minutes after, I say this medication is a miracle.  I am 99.75% pain free ~ the first time in over a year.  So far no side effects other than very thirsty.  Cutting down on coffee and have increased my water intake.

About three days after my first Humira injection I felt amazing. Didn't realize how bad the pain had been for so long. Then I had a setback. I was taking Imuran with the Humira and ran out of Imuran for three days. All the pain returned. I didn't go back to being pain free after that and some symptoms returned. My doctor switched me to Humira biweekly and injections of methotrexate weekly. Pain again subsided. I have had an itchy, puffy reaction at the site of Humira injections. Now after 3 or 4 shots I have horribly itchy, watery, burning eyes. Not sure if this is some kind of allergic indication.",Anonymous

The shot is not painful. I let it stand on the counter 15 minutes before I give it so it's not so cold. My Doctor suggested that I sit in a straight back chair so that the abdominal area is already pinched and you'll have both hands free, then pick a spot on my stomach that's 2 inches away from the navel and just do as the directions explain. You won't feel the needle, but the medication will burn just a little.  I can't even say it hurts. Don't be afraid.",Anonymous

Thanks to a great doctor I was immediately referred to a Rheumatolgist who started me on methotrexate(weekly), prednisone(daily) and Humira every two weeks. My doses of Prednisone was gradually reduced and I have now been off totally for 6 months. I went from 20mg of Methotrexate weekly to zero now. Humira is the only medicine being taken weekly and even though stiffness and swelling have returned to some degree I am still great compared to where I started. Side effects include higher liver enzymes and daily itching outbreaks. Otherwise, if I can remain at this level for another 30 yrs. I'll be fortunate. ",Anonymous

I worked with my Doctor, COBRA provider and Humira customer service to be reinstated.  I have been on it now for a month one injection every two weeks.  I find the auto injector easy to use and safer than a syringe.

She was very nervous about how painful she heard it was but followed the advice of a pharmacist who told her to put an ice pack on the shot location for approximately 5 minutes before and after. It was great advice and worked well for the pain and also the bump she was told to expect. I checked the area about 10 minutes after it was all said and done and couldn't even see where the shot was given.She also read these comments and wanted to respond to the advice about letting the drug get to room temp. Her doctor said that it is extremely important to keep it cold because the proteins will separate, rendering the medicine useless. Hope this helps.",mojoe

After that the pain starts to return.  I am currently researching other medicines so I can stop taking this.  The cost is just too high for me.
