9,Diclofenac,Rheumatoid Arthritis,9.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"February 6, 2019",6,"I was diagnosed with juvenile rheumatoid arthritis at the age of 10. Doctors would prescribe strong opioid pain killers. I get more relief from the diclofenac gel applied to my joints and muscles than from any pain killer. Diclofenac gel is more affective for me  than oxycodone, Morphine, Dilaudid, etc.",Theonlysos

Surgery prescribed.  Meanwhile hurts plenty and loss of balance when pain strikes like a knife mid stride.

I take no other medication for arthritis.",Jai

13,Diclofenac,Rheumatoid Arthritis,10.0,Taken for 10 years or more,"December 10, 2017",13,"I have been using voltaren (diclofenac) for my RA for 27 years without any other strong medications. Yes, I lost my knee joints and had their replacement, however, for all these 27 years I have never stopped working full time job as a teacher. The most recent dosage is 150 mg a day. If I had stronger pain, I did diclofenac shots to myself and that helped a lot. What I noticed, the quality of the European diclofenac is much higher. After staying on the US production or maybe because of aging (or both), I've started feeling side effects: GERD and stomachache at night. So it's time to find something else, though I am grate full to this medication for keeping me alive and productive for 27 years!",Diclofriend
14,Diclofenac,Rheumatoid Arthritis,10.0,Taken for 5 to 10 years,"September 21, 2017",9,I want to answer Bellestar above and give a comment.   I wonder why she was told Diclofenac is being discouraged from use. My son who has a connective tissue disease and has severe joint issues was given the drug years ago by the wonderful Pain Clinic Hospital . It was a miracle drug for his pain. He's had no side effects that we know of.,Countrymom8

16,Diclofenac,Rheumatoid Arthritis,9.0,,"August 3, 2017",23,"I was diagnosed with RA 32years ago. My initial treatment was Myocrisin [gold injections] and diclofenac during flare ups. After 18 years the Myocrisin was not working, so medication was changed. Since then quality of life has not been good, and the only relief from pain was Diclofenac, which settled things down in 1-2 days. Now told it was being discouraged from use, so taken off it. All the alternatives have not worked, so persuaded a new Rhumatologist to re-instate it for short while and life was good again. I had no side effects from this drug. When a flare up occurs I take 2 in the day 75mg and everything quietens down, then it may be weeks before another attack. To me it is a wonder drug. All drugs are a risk, and for me this is good",bellestarr10

When the doctor gave it to me he said I would see a difference or not in a day or two.  Immediately I had relief and could rise from a chair, lean over a table, and pick up objects.
