0,Upadacitinib,Rheumatoid Arthritis,8.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"March 11, 2022",0,"Rinvoq (upadacitinib):I’ve been on Rinvoq for 13 months now for RA. I have always been an optimist and have never had even a whiff of depression in my 57 years of life…until the last several months. My RA seems well-controlled on the Rinvoq, but my mood is getting worse and worse for several months now. I feel hopeless for no apparent reason. I have never had this symptom before, nor any other mental health symptoms. I am not usually prone to moodiness or anxiety. On the contrary, among my friends and family, I have traditionally been the most well-grounded person, the most likely to cope easily with emotionally difficult situations…until now. I guess this must be what depression feels like. Now, I find it hard to remember what it used to feel like to have joy. But, I do know that THIS IS NOT WHO I WAS for the first 56 years of my life. So, I’m wondering if this could be a less-common side effect of Rinvoq? Has anyone else had new-onset of depression or mood disorder with Rinvoq?",Esobek

My specialist  had me on so many meds even had to take injections. They didn't work I was in so much pain. I had a hard time getting up in the morning and walking around. I have it in my hands, fingers, toes, ankles, and knees.  I started seeing  a new specialist  and  he put me on Rinvoq. I have been on it for almost 2 years. I have been noticing I am always tired and sleep a lot. I don't know if this is because of the meds or is it just me. I have been breathing deeper to so is this normal or what?

3,Upadacitinib,Rheumatoid Arthritis,3.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"December 23, 2021",5,"Rinvoq (upadacitinib):I was in a clinical trial for Rinvoq for five (5) years.  Never again.  In September 2021 the FDA issued a ""boxed"" warning (the most serious kind of warning) to be put on Rinvoq regarding the possibility of heart attack and stroke.  The research lab conducting the study never informed me of this and they had to have known because the FDA does not issue boxed warnings overnight.  Thank God the trial ended in October 2021.  In addition, the research lab did not tell me about side affects such as horrible acne with large whiteheads on my face and back pain.  I would not sign up for a clinical trial again because I would not know if they were telling the whole truth and nothing but the truth,  No more Rinvoq for me.  Research lab also told me that Rinvoq would be available at the end of the 5-year trial if I wanted to continue taking it (I don't).  Yes, available at the retail cost of $5,969.00 per month.  Yes, per month.  I don't know anyone who can afford that except the very wealthy.",Charlette

First doctor gave me Celebrex which basically did nothing. Went to doctor no. 2 and he diagnosed the RA properly. Put me straight on to prednisolone 25mg. and booked me in with a specialist. I felt 20 years younger within a few days. I began taking Methotrexate and cutting back 5mgs of the prednisolone every 6 weeks. The pain and swelling started increasing so I stopped reducing the steroids. After 3 months he put me on Plaquenil  and I resumed cutting back on the prednisolone. It got to a point where the pain was controllable after a few hours each day, I'm sero positive so there are good days and not so good days. My job is quite physical generally so the RA had been quite debilitating at times. By about May this year things weren't great again so the doc suggested Rinvoq as an alternative. I've been on it for 2.5 months I'm loving the results. No real side effects yet.",Tony

Off prednisone completely now, and let me tell you, Rinvoq is a game changer. My pain, which was constant and unbearable has been reduced by 80%.

14,Upadacitinib,Rheumatoid Arthritis,10.0,,"September 19, 2021",10,"Rinvoq (upadacitinib):For me, Rinvoq has been a miracle.  I started on it almost 6 months ago and after only a few days all of my symptoms disappeared.  Not only was the pain and stiffness gone but the dry eyes, fatique and swelling gone but my COPD cough completely disappeared and my breathing improved by 10-20%.  My doctor thinks the breathing improved from the inflammation going away.  I'm 72 and honestly felt like I was 25 again!  I have had RA for 7 years and tried Methotrexate, Plaquenil, and Leflunomide along with occasional courses of Prednisone and a few ER trips that called for Morphine.  Before starting the Rinvoq I took Sufasalazine which helped for a couple of years but just helped, had good and bad days with it.  Nothing really worked other than the Prednisone and eventually it didn't help much.  After the Sept. 1 FDA report my doctor encouraged me to stop taking the Rinvoq because of the deadly side effects but I'm debating what to do.  It comes down to quality of life vs. fear of side effect",SAL

The cons of this drug is that it gives me bad fatigue. The fatigue was very disruptive to my life for the first 6-7 months. I have a constant lingering feeling that I am getting sick but never actually get sick. I have also started breaking out around my chin and forehead, I am in my 20s and during puberty I did not suffer from any acne.

So I have discussed this option to my Arthritis doctor to switch me to Rinvoq.  I was exhausted all the time, gained weight, depressed, going to the ER due to experiencing painful flare-ups but they couldn't diagnose my problem even when I told them I was having a RA flare-up, crying for a cortisone shot.  My hands, shoulders, knees were crippling that I couldn't pick up a glass, flush a toilet, etc so I was popping prednisone like candy.   When I first started Rinvoq I was feeling good UNTIL these last 3 months I have been having VERY painful flare-ups again with a sore throat, flu-like symptoms, dry mouth, tiredness, and more weight gain; back to the old painful symptoms again.

The first doctor gave me hydroxychloroquine. The second doctor gave me Leflunomide. None of these very effective. My wrist and fingers get stuck in the night especially when it's cold. The third doctor suggested me specialty medicine called enbrel. Enbrel was effective for the first two or three months. Then it had no effect. Symptoms gotten worse. So the doctor suggested taking Rinvoq. Rinvoq is also useless. Enbrel was very good at least for 3 months. Rinvoq had no effect from the beginning.

I have had a big problem with vertigo which I think has been exacerbated by Rinvoq. An Otologist diagnosed the condition as viral vertigo. I know the literature states that Rinvoq can active the virus that causes shingles and I wonder if it activated a virus that may be affecting my ear. The vertigo has been debilitating at times and the swishing noise is horrible. I was on antivirals for a year along with a mild diuretic and a very low sodium diet. I went a whole year without a problem during which time I was off the antiviral. After a year the problem is back.,dp

Fast forward 6 months later and the drug is keeping me sick about every 6 weeks. I've had multiple sinus infections with 2 of them causing vertigo which makes RA seem like child's play. I have to battle yeast infections, congestion, sinusitis, and horrible acne all over my chin. I am trying to take the drug just a few times a week to keep the swelling down but even that isn't working. I hear a swooshing sound in my ears and I'm always terrified I'm going to get vertigo again and be driving or in a store. What started out as a miracle drug for me has developed into a nightmare.

I have been suffering terribly this past year or so. My Doctor precribed Rinvoq and didn't say much about it. Within the first two days I started feeling better. Almost a month in and I can say I feel like ten years have been lifted from me. It is like a miracle, I am tapering from the prednisone. I am so much more active now. I hope it continues to work.  Oily skin and flushing no big deal",Tiger

Knee had to be drained several times and corticosteroid shots given almost weekly, against regulatory use, just to control the swelling and pain. Started Rinvoq in January 2020. Knee fluid and pain gone within less than three days — it worked very fast! RA went into remission and was off for two weeks starting September 2020. Labs done last week and ZERO inflammation markers in my blood work WHILE OFF MEDICATION. Just went back on Rinvoq at a maintenance dose for COVID-19 protection (reduce cytokine storm/inflammatory response in body). This drug has been a miracle in my life! It shouldn’t be overlooked. Great for inflammation/effusion/overactive immune response. My RA doctor  was able to get my insurance to cover it ($3 co-pay).",Cat

I'm always skeptical about drugs working since I've been trying them for 39 years. Rinvoq says it can start to work 2 weeks to 6 months.  I have noticed little things like easier time standing up and not as stiff when I wake up.  The last 3 days I've been having more pain and stiffness. As far as side effects I've had cough, hoarseness, muscle cramping. Recently extreme bruising, I woke up with bruises all over hands palms back fingers, all over legs and forearms. None of these side effects will cause me to quit the medicine. All pretty mild compared to effects of other meds.",Libramd

My pain has significantly improved but swelling has actually worsened. I now have edema in both legs, ankles, and wrists. I’ve also gained weight with this drug and not happy about that. I love that this drug is in daily pill form vs. a weekly pill or injection and I don’t have to stress about feeling  nauseous and tired after my weekly methotrexate dose. Overall I’m happy to be getting a mostly pain-free life back, but am concerned that my doctor my take me off of it at my next appointment when he sees the amount of edema I now have.",Nanato7
