0,Dexamethasone,Rheumatoid Arthritis,10,Taken for less than 1 month,"January 28, 2021",1,"Doctor said in 20 years she never saw Plaque Psoriasis as bad as mine, I looked like a breakout of the measles or something. So after 8 mg first day, in 30 minutes started feeling better, 3 days later clear skin.... haven't taken for a week and no flare returned. Picking up my script today taking 2mg 2 times a week and a week off to be mild on the body.",Quando62
1,Dexamethasone,Rheumatoid Arthritis,1,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"June 14, 2018",15,"I hated being on this drug. But my rheumatologist insisted. I was compliant for almost three months. During that time I became very irritable and depressed. My appetite surged, and I gained almost 20 lbs during that time. I completely lost interest in sex. I was often weak and tired. And I did not notice much change in my RA symptoms. Simply put, I was no longer myself. I returned to the doctor with my concerns. She actually wanted to increase the dosage!  She is no longer my doctor. I am off Dexamethasone for about six weeks  now. I am feeling much better emotionally. I am off most of my RA meds since I contracted kidney disease because of them.   I see a new doctor in August. But for now I am trying a more holistic approach. So far so good.",MJ
