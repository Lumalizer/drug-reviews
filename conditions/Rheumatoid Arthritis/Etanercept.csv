Sulfasalazine  helped a lot but then I had to have a new rheumatologist due to retirement of the previous and she recommended Enbrel, informing me I could discontinue the Sulfasalazine.  This was a bad idea, substantial pain returned which was alleviated but starting the Sulfazine again.  I have no idea if this very expensive drug is worth the cost.",Anonymous

8,Etanercept,Rheumatoid Arthritis,,Taken for less than 1 month,"July 9, 2021",2,"Enbrel (etanercept):I have recently been diagnosed...is only in this day and age that we as patients reach out to our Doctors and tell them what medications we should be on because of an ad we saw on TV. My followup with the doctor is in one week when these decisions will be made. I have been watching pharmaceutical ads on TV much more closely these days. I will not ask my medical care provider to recommend  Enbrel. The ads as with many many other like minded ads for so many pharmaceuticals treating so many diseases or illnesses. Why should we as real patients with real diseases believe your ads full of ""actor portrayals"" telling us how much better they feel and how improved their quality of life is. If I want acting I will go to the movies. What would be so wrong with featuring actual patients on the actual medications telling us their true experiences?",Peeks
9,Etanercept,Rheumatoid Arthritis,7.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"May 12, 2021",25,Enbrel (etanercept):Do not start this drug if you are not wealthy or if you are near retirement. It did help me while I was working and had commercial insurance. Enbrel gave me copay assistance. However when I retired I was on Medicare and used tufts insurance for prescriptions. Enbrel is a specialty tier drug and the insurance pays 70% However that still leaves you with a $1700 copay which is crazy. Enbrel does not assist you if you're on medicare. Don't start this because then you have to be suddenly cut off and feeling in worse condition than before.,Candy

I am an RN. My Mother was diagnosed about 20 years ago with Rheumatoid Arthritis. She was around 70-71 years young. She quilts and stays busy. She is  now 91 and STILL quilting and gardening, staying busy! I think the combination of someone that stays busy along with the wonder drug, Enbrel, is why she is still able to quilt and do all that she does! Her Rheumatologist shows everyone her xRays because if you saw them you wouldn’t think she could do anything! She’s a beautiful woman inside and out and a great inspiration to others.

I am also on methotrexate and .5 prednisone. I am hoping to get off of these but am doubtful. The prednisone took away all the swelling which was so painful, as you all know. THE RA came on so quickly in March 2019. By September I could barely walk or hold things. I'm in my early 60s and I felt like 90. Now I'm up and moving. No adverse side effects except exhaustion. Feel like I could sleep all day... although I am also going through intense am. and pm. 'hot flashes'. And the injection is a bit painful but it's over fast. Some site swelling. The drug is extremely expensive and my insurance wont cover it. $1325.00 per injection. My doctor has been working on trying to get me a reduced rate.

I tried diets, yoga, supplements, even psychotherapy (because some drs claim RA has emotional roots). While strict diets did offer pain relief, joint damage persisted. I reluctantly started on Enbrel October 2018. I insisted my doc start me on the lowest dose ( a pediatric dose of 25 mg per week. Advocate for yourself! She would have put me on double the amount I actually needed). 25 mg worked. Within 1-2 weeks, my pain was gone. I've been on it for over a year with zero side effects. I know it's a scary drug so I understand people's fear. I had to work through debilitating  panic attacks the first few months ( that's how scared I was of it--I did need some anxiety meds to get me through it), but I have my life back. It's been a miracle drug for me. Both RA and biologics stink,  we each have to decide which is worse. I wish everyone the best.",Kcab

Just wondering if anyone else is feeling this.I intend to stick with Enbrel as its dramatically halted my all over pain and its given me 90 % of my mobility back so far.,DJ Spoon

25,Etanercept,Rheumatoid Arthritis,10.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"April 6, 2019",26,"Enbrel (etanercept):Diagnosed with RA at 22yrs. Started with Plaquenil, then added methotrexate. Took some time to get the dose right due to nausea. That combo helped for 2 years. Then added Enbrel. It helped immediately but still had problems so added Meloxicam. Prednisone as needed for flareups.  After serious ulcers I stopped the meloxicam and prednisone. Enbrel only worked for 1.5yrs. After I'd been on it about a year it started wearing off. I would inject every week but the meds would only last about 5 days and then I'd be disabled until time to take my next injection. Finally it stopped working all together. Just switched to Humira, still taking plaquenil and methotrexate. Many illnesses due to the compromised immune system, and extreme fatigue, but my RA is so severe I am fully disabled without these meds.  I hope I can find one that will last longer.

At that point she even struggled to walk. She was prescribed Methotrexate by NHS in the Uk, which didn’t seem to change anything and had terrible side effects. She was then injected with Embrel in each of the 23 affected joints, which had an immediate effect and she was able to walk and on a lot less pain in a matter of days. She was put on weekly Embel injections and has been on it since, 10 years now. We tried tanking her off twice, after  arteries went into remission, but both times it came back.

I am certainly thankful but wonder how it could work so fast. I have RA, fibro & thyroid autoimmune diseases. Plus degenerative disc in the lower back. Enbrel has even helped w/that. It has been more like a twinge than pain. No swelling, redness or pain anywhere. I was so afraid to take the medication but now that I have wish I hadn’t waited so long.

41,Etanercept,Rheumatoid Arthritis,10.0,,"September 16, 2017",57,Enbrel (etanercept):I live in Western Australia and disturbed by some comments on here. The cost of Embrel is cost of an ordinary prescription $36 for me the government pays the remainder of the cost to the chemist. I also go to the the medical centre every Saturday morning a Dr looks over my prescription and then he advises the nurse to administer the injection also no cost to myself and this is part of nurses duties. I am unsure of the country where people who have made comments referring to cost and that nobody is there to  administer the injection for them.

It was helpful only for a few days and then the rest of the week was too painful.  I then switched to Enbrel, at first 25 mg twice a week, and now 50 mg once a week.  It has been wonderful - I still have joint soreness if I over-do, and  need to take a muscle relaxer at night, but I am so much better.
