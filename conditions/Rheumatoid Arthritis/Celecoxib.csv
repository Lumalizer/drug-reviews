5,Celecoxib,Rheumatoid Arthritis,8,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"October 16, 2019",31,"Celebrex (celecoxib):This medication Celebrex is helping to reduce inflammation and pain.  Do I  still have pain yes. I  started with 200mg I just started taking 400mg. The 200 was helping but not enough, I'll know by the end of this week if the increased dosage of Celebrex (generic) has helped",Bettybean
6,Celecoxib,Rheumatoid Arthritis,9,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"September 21, 2018",50,"Celebrex (celecoxib):I have RA, DDD (Degenerative disc disease), and osteoarthritis.  This medicine helps me so much.  I like to take walks 2 to 3 miles a day.  But if I don't take Celebrex at least twice a week, I am in so much pain.  My feet and back the most. I try not to use it so much because of the side effects scare me. I do think it causes weight gain too. Or its just my age (54) . Celebrex seems to work better than methotrexate.  But I will continue Methotrexate to help reduce joint damage later in life.",Kelly

I haven't experienced any side effects at all.  It took weeks to work, but I couldn't be more pleased with it now.  I've noticed on some of the comments here that it worked immediately for some people, but it's not always like that, so be patient and give it time--hope this helps!",Hele
8,Celecoxib,Rheumatoid Arthritis,9,,"June 21, 2017",57,"Celebrex (celecoxib):Works fantastic, a wonder drug...except for a flushed face for about twenty minutes. I had excruciating hip pain, nothing worked except Tylenol and Motrin in huge doses. One 200 mg dose of celebrex reduced 90% of my pain and allowed greater range of motion. I'm truly amazed. I have been using this two days. 50 yrs old and had a very physical life, this seems to be my path back to full physical activity.",Zedogguy

It is a miracle medicine for me! !!,Lanky mom

11,Celecoxib,Rheumatoid Arthritis,1,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"August 18, 2016",3,"The only thing the TEVA 200 mg brand of celecoxib did was make me sick. The medicine gave me diarrhea, heartburn to the point of reflux after 3 months of taking it & increased swelling & joint pain.

14,Celecoxib,Rheumatoid Arthritis,9,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"June 22, 2016",7,"52 y/o male; I have dealt with joint pain 15 yrs. I dismissed as aging. Hands & knees really bad, & feet. Complained to Dr. over yrs. only to be dismissed. Last 3 yrs pain increased after walking, yard work. Get out of bed, hobble 5 min. before can walk. Have sporadic scalp psoriasis 20 yrs. Thanks to TV comm. by pro golfer Phil Mickelson, life's changed. I realized/suggested to Dr. I may have Psoriatic Arthritis. He agreed. Started me on Celebrex, 200mg x2. On for 1 mo now. Fixed all fore mentioned issues! Unbelievable! I've hauled 20 wheelbarrows of dirt from neighbors yard to mine, from across street! Couldn't have done a mo. ago. Worried its a black box drug through!

16,Celecoxib,Rheumatoid Arthritis,10,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"January 4, 2013",172,Celebrex (celecoxib):I was given Celebrex for arthritis in my knee. After taking it for about two weeks I started to notice not only was my knee better and I was able to resume all of my normal activities with no pain but my foot that I had been suffering from planter fasciitis for two and a half years was finally not hurting. I had been through every treatment  and three different foot doctors with no relief at all. Celebrex is by far the best medicine I have taken it has given me back my life in more ways then one.,Anonymous

18,Celecoxib,Rheumatoid Arthritis,7,,"March 14, 2011",90,"Celebrex (celecoxib):Have been on Celebrex for a year.  Initially for TMJ issues, then picked up mild-to-moderate rheumatoid arthritis last summer.  Been on it continuously except for a couple month long steroid regimens. I wouldn't call it a miracle medicine, but it knocks my inflammation and pain back about 60%.  Certainly not as effective as the steroid, but 60% is enough to keep me fully functional and unlike the steroid, I have minimal to zero side effects with it.",Matt in NC

I started on prednisone 20mg which helped somewhat but I was having flare ups in the ankles and hands.  Finally got switched to Celebrex because the pain and swelling were not going away. 200mg daily - all I can say is it's been like night and day since I started taking it - less pain, less swelling, better days!",32yrold woman

The pain gradually came back and I had so many flare ups even when I was taking it.  My doctor just gave me Prednisone 20 mg daily to combine with Celebrex. I started yesterday and most of the pain has gone, however, my doctor advised not to take Prednisone for more than one week in order to prevent having the serious side effects, such as bone problems.",ktl682
