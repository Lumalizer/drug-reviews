1,Nabumetone,Rheumatoid Arthritis,9.0,Taken for 10 years or more,"October 8, 2020",4,I can't live without nabumetone. It controls my pain better than any other single drug. Even better than narcotics.,Magdala
2,Nabumetone,Rheumatoid Arthritis,,,"June 21, 2020",4,"My doctor prescribed Nambutone for my TMJ. But I do have arthritis in my hands, knees and feet. They just hurt all the time, especially since I've been moving to another house. I hadn't been taking my Nambutone so I thought about trying it again. Twice a day, 500 mg. After about a week it started working and I didn't hurt when I got up in the mornings. But now I'm in the bathroom constantly with stomach pain and lots of bowel movements that has turned into diarrhea. It works great, but I'm gonna have to lay off of it for a while.",Jane
3,Nabumetone,Rheumatoid Arthritis,10.0,,"April 7, 2018",19,This medicine was like a miracle pill for my knee and ankle pain from inflammatory arthritis. Both my legs were in agony from inflammation I could barely walk. I took one dose of this and the next day I could walk without pain!  My pain level went down from an 8 down to a 2! It was such a relief to be able to function again.,Luna
4,Nabumetone,Rheumatoid Arthritis,2.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"March 2, 2018",5,Very bad knees.  Only been taking it for 2 weeks. Not much help so far. I do have very bad headaches in morning.  May be a side affect.  But I will keep trying it for a while. I really want it to work for me also very expensive   but it will be worth it if it works.  I have had extensive back surgery. My back is not in pain just my knees. It may have helped my back a bit.,Jan

Orginally prescribed a Cox-2 inhibitor, have high Blood pressure, the cox-2 experience was VERY BAD.  Then tried Nabumetone 750mg, was prescribed 2 daily.  Was acceptable to my Blood Pressure.

8,Nabumetone,Rheumatoid Arthritis,4.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"August 31, 2012",36,"Relafen (nabumetone):Like Celebrex and Vioxx, this caused blood pressure spurts, along with dizziness, weakness, and other side effects. Too dangerous for me to take because of how high it would send my blood pressure within an hour or so of taking it.",Anonymous
