0,Mobic,Rheumatoid Arthritis,10,Taken for less than 1 month,"February 13, 2022",0,"This is a wonder drug. Having broken both of my ankles in my early 20’s, I am usually in a lot of pain. Especially now that I’m 36 and work in the service industry and am on my feet 13 hours at a time. Before mobic I would come home at night crying and unable to walk the arthritis was so bad. Nothing helped... not ibuprofen not lorcets not anything. My doctor prescribed me Mobic and all I can say is wow. Not only am I completely pain- free at the end of my shifts, my usually awful period cramps are now nonexistent. I was skeptical at first but if you have issues like info, I absolutely cannot recommend this stuff enough:",Gigi5406
1,Mobic,Rheumatoid Arthritis,8,,"December 13, 2020",9,"I have been on mobic about 18 months.  I didn’t think it was doing much till I ran out.  Then I realised, mobic has reduced my pain and morning stiffness substantially.  Very good and doesn’t bother my stomach.  I take it after meals in the evening with my plaquenil.  Also on plaquenil and prednisolone in the mornings.  Trying to get away without using methotrexate",Sue
2,Mobic,Rheumatoid Arthritis,2,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"April 27, 2020",10,"I have been prescribed 4 different arthritis medicines... Mobic being one of them. Took as directed and took for a minimum of 3 weeks. It didn't help me at all. Steroids seems to be the only thing that help. Had fluid removed from both knees within a week of each other, and then knee surgery (subchondroplasty) in February. I have found no surgery and no medicine has helped. Within a couple days of being off the steroids, both my knees will swell up and I have to use a walker or crutches to walk more than 2 feet.",Steeleone
3,Mobic,Rheumatoid Arthritis,1,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"October 26, 2016",30,I have tried mobic for quite some time and just recently switched to celebrex.  Pros mobic is cheap but ineffective.

7,Mobic,Rheumatoid Arthritis,8,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"January 7, 2016",50,"I have taken Mobic sporadically for the last 3 years.  I only take it when I'm really in pain and cannot manage the pain through natural methods.  It helps me to sleep, and it helps the pain in my hands and hip.  I do not feel groggy when I wake up, but sometimes I am stiff and hurting from sleeping so deeply.",JodyE

11,Mobic,Rheumatoid Arthritis,9,,"December 19, 2013",152,Was on  Voltaren for months. Maybe my body got used to it and maybe it will also get used to this but this is a miracle. I had 9 places with pain. After I pop this pill (15mg) I feel great within an hour and even more amazing throughout the day and into the night. Probably a good 12 hrs of relief. I got to find a way to eat in the morning and take it. Currently I'm taking it with a big lunch but miserable in the morning after it wears off from the day before and before I take it that day. This makes me feel normal. Especially my fingers.,monkeyheadchb55

13,Mobic,Rheumatoid Arthritis,9,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"July 22, 2013",145,"I had been on Relafen for years for my osteoarthritis, and I just discovered this summer that I have Rheumatoid Arthritis. I was still on the Relafen and had driven a long ways to see one of my doctors, and the RA was so bad in my knees and feet that it was becoming difficult to walk. I called my Orthopedic Surgeon, and they changed my NSAID from Relafen to Mobic, and within an hour of taking the Mobic, I had relief. What a difference it has made for me! It made such a difference with the inflammation in my joints, and made it easier for me to walk. After taking the Mobic for a few days, I had improved greatly. I have had no stomach or intestinal issues from the medication.",Relief Within an Hour!

17,Mobic,Rheumatoid Arthritis,8,,"April 14, 2011",88,"I have been on Mobic (or some generic form) for 3 years now for PsA - Psoriatic Arthritis.During this time, I got quite ill and my GP sent me for a test. I had an MRI and wore a heart monitor for 24 hours. They thought I was having seizures. After 2 years of feeling dreadful only at night my GP took me off the Mobic to settle a stomach upset and I realized that I no longer had any of the neurological effects anymore. Upon mentioning this to my Specialist - he said that the neurological side effects were quite common with Mobic - yet neither of the GP's saw new of them. So just be aware, this can make you feel like you are running slow, your brain may slow down and you might fall over.",GCChriss
18,Mobic,Rheumatoid Arthritis,7,,"May 5, 2010",44,"I started taking this medicine to help with carpal tunnel issues I was having. The doctor had me taking 15-30 mg a day, which I see according to this site, is more than I'm supposed to have. It helped the carpel tunnel, and has done wonders for my knee pain. It only helps mildly with my hand pain (arthritis). As far as side effects are that it has affected my bowel motions and I don't always have much warning before I need to take one.",Anonymous

It has helped me so much that I get teary eyed just thinking about it. The doctor that I am seeing now may have saved my life.",sickntide
20,Mobic,Rheumatoid Arthritis,10,,"July 13, 2009",148,"Mobic has been a good drug for all the basic inconveniences of arthritis. I was this close to going in for a knee replacement when my Geriatric Specialist offered Mobic.  I take Pepcid with it as it is very hard on the stomach, but it has increased my mobility and reduced the pain by 90%. I am very pleased with this drug. Hooray!",monetscgb
