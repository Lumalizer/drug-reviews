1,Naprosyn,Rheumatoid Arthritis,5,,"November 3, 2009",74,"I've had RA for 4 years.  500mg naproxen tablets were my first treatment.  They definitely helped the day get better and be able to function daily.  However, they did not stop the morning stiffness and pain or the build up of inflamation in my body.  I definitely needed a more serious drug to stop the progression of the disease.",Anonymous
