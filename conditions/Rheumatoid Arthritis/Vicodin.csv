Now have osteoporosis, scolosis, arthritis and more.I have always cut the pills in half and never over used them. My dr gives me 2 prescriptions a year and I make them last. I have not had any side effects from this med and take a half most of the time. A whole one only if in severe pain. Sometimes do not take them for months depending on my pain level",Mini

2,Vicodin,Rheumatoid Arthritis,8.0,Taken for 5 to 10 years,"May 15, 2018",73,I was born with a gene called hlab27+ . I have arthritis and consecutive tissue disorder. As a child I tried to play but got tired and too painful to stay up for long periods of time. I stayed in bed a lot. I tried to ride bikes with my friends as a teen but struggled. Until a Dr put me on pain meds in my 40s that I felt relief for the first time. Now the medical field is trying to reverse back. They need to hear the other side of the people that have been helped. It is not our fault if people are misusing their medication. I really do not believe this is the cause of the epidemic. Drunk drivers are caused by drinking too much and driving. If you don't over drink and you don't drive while drinking then there's no issue. Same thing here. I truly had no life before this pain medicine,Dee

8,Vicodin,Rheumatoid Arthritis,9.0,,"February 17, 2011",127,I am 28 and have severe RA and fibromyalgia. I was on Darvocet which worked good. But then that was taken off the market. I've been on Vicodin for a little while now and it works wonders for me.  Which is great since I'm up chasing my 5 yr old all day.  It's the only other medicine I've tried that actually works.,Anonymous
