0,Glucosamine,Rheumatoid Arthritis,9,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"September 4, 2018",5,I started taking glucosamine chondroitin msm for moderate to severe knee joint pain related to arthritis. I am also a breastfeeding mother and there is not much research on the affects of taking it during nursing so I figured I'd leave my experience.  The supplements worked wonders for my knee pain. It is amazing. And had zero effects on my nursing 18 month old.  However it did drastically reduce my milk supply. I was taking it for about a month and I have been off of it for 3 days now and my knee pain is coming back but my milk supply is coming back also. I will be waiting until I wean to take glucosamine again,Llcoolmom
