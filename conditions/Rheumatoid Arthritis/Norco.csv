0,Norco,Rheumatoid Arthritis,1,Taken for 5 to 10 years,"February 24, 2022",8,"I have crippling arthritis, degenerative disk disease and about to have cervical spine surgery with putting in a metal plate Bolts and fusion. I’m also scheduled for knee replacement as soon as possible after cervical surgery. Since they’ve taken the Yellow Norco off the market I’m getting no relief!! With some of the white norco I get maybe a bit of relief but with others no relief at all!! I believe some may have a small amount of hydrocodone but others none!! Surely something could be done. If the ones responsible for this had the pain most of us have I guarantee they’d be doing something about it!!! PLEASE bring the Yellow Norco back!!",Peggy
1,Norco,Rheumatoid Arthritis,8,Taken for 10 years or more,"October 17, 2021",8,Ever since Watson brand became unavailable I've had not much luck with the brands available. I tried several pharmacies with little to no luck. I've been taking first hydrocodone since mid 1990s and about 5 years ago began Norco 10/325My doctor never had a problem prescribing my meds and had me sign a waiver to continue use. I've been to two different pain clinics over the years and they did no good. I moved to Washington and my new Dr won't provide any pain meds except muscle relaxers which never worked. Now I am forced to buy my meds through the street from my Dr's own patients. So very wrong. What is wrong with this world!!,Fedup

3,Norco,Rheumatoid Arthritis,1,,"March 17, 2021",25,"Feb 28,2021I've been getting my prescription Norco 10/325 from CVS and lately they haven't been working on my pain. So I called my doctor and mention it they suggested I try a different pharmacy could be manufacturer so I did.  I tried Walgreens worse decision because they gave me a brand called Mallinckrodt. It don't help at all with pain. I've had really horrible side effects bad weigh gain, head aches, depression, forgetfulness.  Never again.",D.
4,Norco,Rheumatoid Arthritis,3,Taken for 5 to 10 years,"February 3, 2021",52,I've been taking Norco for 10 years I've never had a problem but my pharmacy changed to this pharmaceutical company mallinckrodt and I'm literally taking one pill every four hours and it still doesn't work it takes 30 to 40 minutes for it to take effect so I sit here in pain. it just seems that there's something wrong with this drug I've never had a problem before I don't have an addiction to these pills I've been very careful only to take them when I need them.,Annie
5,Norco,Rheumatoid Arthritis,1,,"June 9, 2020",640,"This Mallinckrodt  acetaminophen/hydrocodone generic Norco is absolute rubbish! I've complained to my doctor, to the pharmacy, to the FDA too many times to count, and to the company itself. I'm at my wit's end in pain! What is going on and how are they getting away with this? For 5 years I've been on this medication and when it was Watson brand it worked fine, didn't take away all the pain but it was better than what I am experiencing now!  I'm seriously thinking about asking my doctor to switch me from 10 mg to 5 mg because someone said they worked great, maybe it's just the 10's that are junk. Tonight I am ordering some drug tests just to see if anything shows up because honest to god I am almost 100% positive there is not any active ingredients in the Mallinckrodt 10 mg. Why should I be crying in pain after taking 2???? ENOUGH. I am in the process of getting a chemical analysis of my medication.  ",Bootsie
6,Norco,Rheumatoid Arthritis,10,Taken for 5 to 10 years,"January 17, 2020",27,"What’s everyone’s issue with Mallinkcrodt? I’ve been taking 10-325 for 5 years. When I don’t take them, I’m in tremendous pain. When I do take them, I am not. They work just fine for me... Take them as prescribed and with ibuprofen if necessary.",Captain America

8,Norco,Rheumatoid Arthritis,10,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"May 30, 2012",133,"I've had back pain for years. Then I started getting really bad pain in my knee and found out I have Rheumatoid Arthritis and Osteoarthritis and I'm only 28 yrs old. I have been on Lortab 10/500 for 6 yrs. Then started going to a pain specialist and I'm now on Tramadol ER 300mg 1x a day and Norco 10/325 4-6x a day and it works miracles. I also take the muscle relaxer, Flexeril and it helps very well too. I still have pain but I always will for the rest of my life because of my arthritis. But these medicines makes life much better.",KP323
