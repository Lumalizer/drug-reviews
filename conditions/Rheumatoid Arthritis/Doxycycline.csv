0,Doxycycline,Rheumatoid Arthritis,9,Taken for less than 1 month,"July 21, 2020",14,"I have suffered from severe inflammatory arthritis for 10 years. I have it in over 40 joints. I was on prednisone for 3 years that gave me cataracts and DMARDS including Humira and methotrexate. I am considered to have refractory arthritis, meaning I donâ€™t respond well to multiple treatments. I struggle with regular  respiratory Illnesses as a result of  Immunosuppression. I recently was prescribed doxycycline and began to feel considerably better.  Dr. Brown might have a point!",Anonymous
1,Doxycycline,Rheumatoid Arthritis,10,,"December 13, 2019",38,"20 years ago (1998) my wife got a flu shot, which was contaminated with mycoplasma bacteria. The result was Psoriatic arthritis, she was treated with Remicade, a popular biologic, and methotrexate. In 2008 we were made aware of the fact that arthritis is a bacterial infection not an ""autoimmune"" disease. We found an ethical Rheumatologist who put my wife on Doxycycline 50mg daily. She saw results in 6 months, she was off Remicade. She still took the poison methotrexate for 10 more years until it started liver cirrhosis. When she stopped that and with NAC (N-acteyl cystine) and milk thistle she overcame the cirrhosis. The fact is ""autoimmune diseases"" are usually a bacterial infection which can be cured, not just treat the symptoms. The ethical doctor is now trying to get her off the Doxycycline which means she is cured of the mycoplasma bacteria.",TVLEE
2,Doxycycline,Rheumatoid Arthritis,10,,"December 30, 2017",39,"I have  aggressive RA and was put on doxycycline by a doctor and was supposed to take uptake inhibitor and prednisone at the same time.After reading negative comments about prednisone decided to take doxycycline alone.  Within 3 days I started to get some relief and by 6 days it was much more.  My next appointment with doctor was at 7 days but I was not able to get there. I split pills in half to last till appointment.When I told doctor I felt much better from doxycycline he said no evidence suggests it is helpful. I had already done research online and knew this was not true. I found a source that gave me doxycycline. Roadback.org suggested 3 times a week 100mgs, Monday Wednesday Friday, I'm still hanging in there ",Danny Boy 1
3,Doxycycline,Rheumatoid Arthritis,3,,"August 24, 2017",14,"WOW! I have tried biologics, methotrexate, TNF blockers, and Prednisone to treat severe RA and basically concluded nothing treats this evil monster. Then, I tried doxycycline, and WOW. The agonizing constant pain and fatigue subsided within the first week. 200 mg a day for the next 90 days until my rheumatologist appt. I could hardly wait to share the great news!! I felt normal for the first time in 4 1/2 years!! Then, 35 days in things took a sudden turn. I started getting skin tears which is a common occurrence in the elderly. I am 50. My skin tone changed and appeared see through, opaque. When I ran my finger down my arm it instantly left a bruise. Suddenly I had pus bumps all up my arms and the back of my legs. Goodbye Doxy.",LDLD
4,Doxycycline,Rheumatoid Arthritis,8,,"May 6, 2016",32,"For me this drug has helped when others have failed me. I started simponi and it worked great for months until I developed a severe allergic reaction to it for some reason then everything I tried after similar to simponi I became allergic to in some way. Finally I found an artical online that talked about the use of antibiotics to treat RA. That is when I asked my doctor about trying Doxycycline. She once took me off of it and tried Minocycline which did not work for me in fact it made me worse, please never try this. Then she took me off of everything I got worse again, until finally putting me back on the doxycycline recently and I am slowly getting better again.",Paetra
