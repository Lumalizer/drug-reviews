0,Leflunomide,Rheumatoid Arthritis,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"March 5, 2022",0,"Diagnosed with RA in Sept of 2021 after ultrasounds of hands and feet as blood work had not shown RA.  Took prednisone with methotrexate for a month. Taken off due to feet and ankle swelling. Took either acetaminophen or ibuprofen for continuing pain and trouble sleeping.  Taking 10 mg of leflunomide once daily for past week but no relief yet.  Hands and feet throbbing and burning.  Experiencing nausea and headache in mornings. Assume it’s side effects but going to try to continue until next rheumatologist appointment in 2 weeks.  Worried about possible increase in blood pressure, poor liver function, and hair loss.  I take 20 mg. (recently upped from 10 mg ) lisonopril for moderate high blood pressure. Diagnosed with morphia since I was 12 yrs old, fibromyalgia at 33, and RA at 69.  At 70 now and wondering if I should go to John Hopkins for a complete work up.  I am surprised and worried that this drug stays in your system so long and often needs another drug to remove from system.",Neat

2,Leflunomide,Rheumatoid Arthritis,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"January 29, 2022",1,"I took 20 mg of this medication about 6 months ago for 10 days. After a few days of taking it, I developed a very itchy rash on my arms, legs, belly, and back. After that, I stopped taking it so I don't know if it would have helped with my RA symptoms. I take allergy medicine everyday to calm it. The rash has remained and has spread more after I was put on blood pressure medication and began using a steroid cream (2 months ago). It has been slowly diminishing since then.  I had a blood test to see if the drug was still present.  It's there but in small amounts, .018mcg/mL, where .020mcg/mL is considered eliminated. But I can't see how it can be anything else causing the rash because it started right after taking it, is a common side effect, and can remain in the body for a long time. But my rheumatologist, a dermatologist and an allergist are convinced the leflunomide is not the cause of the rash. I'm convinced it is.",Anonymous
3,Leflunomide,Rheumatoid Arthritis,2.0,,"December 16, 2021",2,"Arava (leflunomide):Caused stomach upset, worse the first two weeks and then slowly subsided. It really did help with pain. However, I was only on it about two months and lost substantial amount of hair. As a middle age woman, thinning hair is another issue to deal with as you face all the challenges of ageing, and this was really a disappointment because I’m in question if my hair will grow back now that I’ve stopped the medication. It also gave me mouth sores and some acne, which otherwise I have always had clear skin. Pain relief vs. hair? It’s awful that we have to find out if that will be the effect the drug will have on each individual for its effects are different for all. But personally I can’t handle this amount of hair loss, maybe a little hair loss I could have tolerated, but not at this level.",Anonymous

Went through 6-18 week trials of 6 different biologics (currently taking Olumiant) without full remission but achieved about 60% reduction in all RA symptoms.  My rheumatologist and I, not  satisfied with my only partial remission, decided to add leflunomide to the mix (20 mg/day) about 2.5 months ago.  As stated above, I am close to complete remission!

Diarrhea, to being ""very regular"" was tolerable, but the pneumonia was not.

To be fair, I do not tolerate meds very well at all (maybe being a redhead/drug interaction issue), so hopefully a different result for others. Not sure if I truly want to stop or not as it did help with the pain initially, and possibly more if I stay on it.",Markwr

Methotrexate was also a difficult med., which caused confusion, depression, loss of balance, hair loss and an INCREASE in joint pain.  Arava had similar effects, but instead of 5 weeks as with Methotrexate, she was only able to tolerate 3 days of Arava! (at 1/2 dose per rheumy recommendation).  She had symptoms very much like a stroke the evening of the third day - unable to speak more than a word or two, not to mention absolute terror as well as the effects listed above.  For anyone keeping track: she waited a full 2 weeks between stopping methotrexate and trying the Arava. after 5 weeks now, she's ALMOST back to normal.  Beware!",EvilLena

Just by increasing it from 4 tabs a week to 1 tab every day I've only had a couple small headaches, and pain was greatly decreased in my fingers.  So far (at 3 weeks) still leaves a lot to desire.
