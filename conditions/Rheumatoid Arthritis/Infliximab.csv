0,Infliximab,Rheumatoid Arthritis,9.0,Taken for 10 years or more,"July 30, 2021",3,"Remicade (infliximab):I've been on Remicade a long time. Spanning 19 years, but with one year of Humira due to a coverage problem and one awful year trying Xeljanz at the urging of my now-former MD. I was happy to return to Remicade. It's not perfect, but it keeps me controlled most of the time.",BeachMR
1,Infliximab,Rheumatoid Arthritis,10.0,Taken for 10 years or more,"July 15, 2021",3,"Remicade (infliximab):I’ve had RA since 1981 with no relief from any of the drugs on the market at that time, e.g. gold injections, Plaquenil, Penicilamine, all NSAIDS, high dose methotrexate, prednisone etc. In 2001, I started Remicade with low dose methotrexate. It has changed my life. Within the first 4 doses, my fatigue disappeared. I have had no new joints involved for the past 20 years. I’ve had no side effects from Remicade. The only thing the medication hasn’t done is repair the damaged joints! That’s taken surgeries and joint replacements. I am very grateful for the benefits from Remicade.",Cornus
2,Infliximab,Rheumatoid Arthritis,10.0,Taken for 10 years or more,"February 28, 2020",22,"Remicade (infliximab):I was diagnosed with RA about 12 years ago. Started on Methotrexate but had to discontinue because of higher than normal enzyme levels in either my kidneys or liver (can't remember which organ). My RA doctor recommended we switch to a biologic Remicade. I was also on Plaquinel and Leuflunomide along with Remicade but have since discontinued Plaquinel with no issues. Still taking leuflunomide. I've been taking Remicade (800 mg infusion every 6 weeks) and Leuflunimide (pill once a day)now for over 10 years since my diagnosis of RA. I've had no side effects with Remicade or leuflunomide,  no joint damage (caught RA diagnosis very early) and in complete remission for over 10 years. Now my insurance company wants to switch me to Inflectra over Remicade because it is cheaper. I may have no choice but I'll be calling my RA doctor and see what he thinks. May have to appeal to the insurance company if RA doctor has reservations and stay on Remicade which works remarkably for me!",Jimmy C
3,Infliximab,Rheumatoid Arthritis,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"January 30, 2020",10,"Remicade (infliximab):My mother had RA, was prescribed ""remicade"" as an option for her RA.  To say the least, we ended up burying her. Shortly after taking remicade my mother's health diminished quickly.  I do believe the doctor was at fault for suggesting this medicine due to her prior medical conditions.  The drug was too strong. Be careful, or you could end up apart of a Eulogy!",LSJ
4,Infliximab,Rheumatoid Arthritis,5.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"January 22, 2019",2,"I have been taking Plaquenil for 6 years and then 2 years ago added Methotrexate to the regime.  4 months ago the Dr. added Remicade infusion treatments.  After the 1st treatment, the pain in my wrist went away but the swelling remained.  I was thrilled.  But by the 2nd treatment 2 weeks later, some of the pain came back.  4 weeks later, I received another treatment.  I began to have severe muscle pain in my legs and feet along with joint pain throughout my body.    I don't know if  it was my RA or my Fibromyalgia that flared.   The muscle pain subsided some as well as the joint pain.  However, when I took my last treatment 8 weeks later, the muscle pain and joint pain returned.  It has been 4 weeks since the last infusion and I am still experiencing sporadic muscle pain and continued joint pain.  Prior to starting Remicade, I was not having severe muscle pain nor as much joint pain.  I don't want to further this treatment and will be talking with my doctor for alternatives.",debhonda
5,Infliximab,Rheumatoid Arthritis,,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"November 4, 2018",52,Remicade (infliximab):My wife had RA from when she was a child. She had used the normal meds till remicade. She was in Japan and started on remicade in Apr 2007 and die in Feb 2008 from the reactions/side effect to it. I advise that if you get any of the side effect symptoms to see your doctor right away. I have found that if you get one symptom you will get more. There are 3 pages of side effects/reactions.,Anonymous

First I was on Plaquenil which never seemed to help and on top of it I developed a terrible hive rash which went away once I stopped taking it. Next I tried Humira. That worked great for about 6 months before my symptoms came back. Now I'm on Remicade and have been for almost a year now. It works great. I get my infusion every 8 weeks and have NO SYMPTOMS!! I love Remicade. It gave me my life back. I am slightly concerned though because I've developed another rash that won't seem to go away after 2 months of dealing with it, trying steroids etc etc. Cross your fingers it's not Remicade causing my rash.

I started remicade nearly 4 years ago, my Dr started me out getting an infusion every 8 weeks and over the first year he brought it down to every 4 weeks. It's been working great but after the first 2 years my knees started bothering me but after some injection at my orthopedist they have been under control. Now both my elbows are really bothering me, at first it was when I woke up but now it's 24-7. I go in for my next infusion next week and will talk to my rheumatologist about the pain.

Amazing for my  Juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA), my arthritis started when I was a baby and I am now 25 year old female. Within the first year I developed psoriasis, who cares right? I can walk, I can actually bend my knees, zero pain. I started doing UVB light therapy and my psoriasis has not been back. 2016 I developed what I first thought was heat rash. Turned out after months and months of pain, swelling, terrible rash all over my legs that I had developed hypersensitivity leukocytoclastic vasculitis. A listed rare, severe side effect which immediately had my doctor taking me off of remicade. Giving remicade a 5 because it worked for me but couldn't continue.",crystal92

After a year and 1/2 of trying different medications with no relief, I started Remicade. The first two Infusions got rid of the flu like symptoms and the horrible aching pain throughout my body. The third Infusion got rid of the same symptoms, except I do feel knee and back pain still due to damage done to those areas from arthritis. I felt the back and knee pain after the first two Infusions too.  I didn't realize how sick I was until I felt better. The last time I didn't feel like I had the flu all the time, was 32 years ago!

Remicade was started & after one infusion I had a horrible reaction: Serum Sickness"" . Paralyzed for 3 days, severe allodynia (pain all over). Would never take this drug.
