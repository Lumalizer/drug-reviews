0,Azulfidine,Rheumatoid Arthritis,10,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"October 25, 2019",83,"56 yo female diagnosed with RA two years ago. Before the diagnosis I had severe pain in my hands, arms, shoulders, knees, ankles and legs. I really thought I was going in the direction of a wheelchair. I had been a runner but never thought I would run again. After about six months of being on the medicine  Azilfidine I was able to start running again. This year in July, I qualified for the Boston Marathon! Something Iâ€™ve only dreamt about, thank you so much for the medicine!!",Runnergirl
