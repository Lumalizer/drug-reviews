0,Aspirin,Rheumatoid Arthritis,10,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"January 28, 2014",19,"Stanback Analgesic (aspirin):I have rheumatoid arthritis in my shoulders and hands. My doc has had me try several different NSAID's for it. I was having the best results with plain old ibuprofen. But I was having to take 16 - 20 200 mg tablets a day. I saw Stanback at a local discount store and got 2 boxes. I was suffering terribly from the shoulder and hand pain and was willing to try anything. I tried Stanback, and it was like a miracle for me! If you're not familiar with Stanback it is a headache powder you can either take mixed with a liquid or pour straight on the tongue. It's very old school but works well and doesn't even taste bad.",JohnHalo
1,Aspirin,Rheumatoid Arthritis,10,,"August 18, 2008",22,Ascriptin Maximum Strength (aspirin):I have used this aspirin for about 30 years to help with rheumatoid arthritis. I miss it terribly when I have to stop it for tests or medical procedures. The coating helps to keep it from hurting my stomach. ,Anonymous
