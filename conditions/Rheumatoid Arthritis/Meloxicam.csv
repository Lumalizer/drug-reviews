0,Meloxicam,Rheumatoid Arthritis,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"February 13, 2022",0,"Mobic (meloxicam):This is a wonder drug. Having broken both of my ankles in my early 20’s, I am usually in a lot of pain. Especially now that I’m 36 and work in the service industry and am on my feet 13 hours at a time. Before mobic I would come home at night crying and unable to walk the arthritis was so bad. Nothing helped... not ibuprofen not lorcets not anything. My doctor prescribed me Mobic and all I can say is wow. Not only am I completely pain- free at the end of my shifts, my usually awful period cramps are now nonexistent. I was skeptical at first but if you have issues like info, I absolutely cannot recommend this stuff enough:",Gigi5406

2,Meloxicam,Rheumatoid Arthritis,5.0,,"July 9, 2021",1,"I just read all through the comments and they have been very helpful. I’ve been taking meloxicam for about 16 months. Also Gabapentin, omeprozale and 5mg narcos. When I first went to my new doctor I weighed 186 pounds. Mind you I’ve been a slim person all my life. 6’3 and always weighed around 180-200 pounds and I’m 49 right now. Over the course of several months I noticed my stomach was getting bigger and my clothes was much tighter. I went back to my doctor on my 3 month schedule and weighed in as usual and every 3 months I had gained like 9-12 pounds. As others have stated on here about them not changing their diet and it’s the same case with me. My diet hasn’t changed hardly at all and I’m still gaining weight.",Ryno
