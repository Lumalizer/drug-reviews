0,Prednisone,Rheumatoid Arthritis,10.0,Taken for 5 to 10 years,"March 24, 2021",6,20 mg a day has controlled my rheumatoid arthritis with very predictable results and few if any side effects,Anonymous
1,Prednisone,Rheumatoid Arthritis,9.0,,"August 7, 2020",6,I started out with sero-negative R/A. It took them 2 years to diagnose it as the rheumatoid factor does not show in your blood. I took Methotrexate shots plus Paquinille and Sulfasalazine as an aggressive treatment. Many side effects but eventually went into remission. A few years ago I had a quadruple bypass and soon after the R/A came back. I have been on Predisone many times while waiting for meds to cut in and for very bad flares. It's been the ONLY drug of all that works get rid of the inflammation which causes such extreme pain. I am now on an injection of Cimzia every 10 days and 12.5 mgs of Methrotrexate which works way better than Arava for me. I still get bad flares once in a while so I take a healthy dose (20 to 30 mgs) for a few days until it settles. As little as possible and for as short a duration is the best approach. I am also a type 2 diabetic so I have to watch my sugar levels.,Candy
2,Prednisone,Rheumatoid Arthritis,7.0,,"May 24, 2020",45,"Maybe I did not read down far enough but there seemed to be little ""help"" offered. Here is what I have:Epsom salt baths. ES is full of magnesium and magnesium works against inflammation. Cabbage has 5 major anti-inflammatory compounds. Eat all the vinegar  based coleslaw you want!Fat releases a group of highly inflammatory compounds known as cykotines. Lose fat and you greatly reduce their effects. Drink lots of water.Tumeric has terrific anti-inflammatory compounds and rheumatologists acknowledge this. Red meat, fried foods, processed foods and dairy will definitely NOT help. The stomach can cause inflammation. Use a probiotic. You must get rid of negative influences like people who are constantly bringing up the negative and saying things to increase worry. When you have someone whose entire conversation is doom and gloom ... they need to go!",JtheBSG

4,Prednisone,Rheumatoid Arthritis,1.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"October 1, 2019",36,"My grandfather was diagnosed with RA in his 30s. Following knee replacement surgery at 61, he was put on Prednisone. At 66, he went to the hospital, within 2 hours he was put on life support and died the following day. It was New Year’s Eve. Cause of death - pneumonia. Prednisone masked his symptoms until it was too late. He never even knew he was sick. Prednisone is a miracle worker for most people. I’ve taken it for short periods of time to get my severe eczema under control, but I protest every time. I’m always afraid to take it even briefly because of how I lost my best friend; my hero. It’s a cruel joke, really. My grandpa was in the 1st Marine Division at Guadalcanal, survived Korea, came home from Vietnam...taken out by a tiny pill. For those in pain, I know how desperately you search for relief and when you find it, you never want to let go. This one, in my opinion, should not be taken indefinitely. If Prednisone works for you, please just take with caution.",StillHurts
5,Prednisone,Rheumatoid Arthritis,,,"September 15, 2019",28,"Me too...Because of the length of time on Prednisone, I now look like a moon-faced pregnant linebacker. BUT it has been the ONLY medicine since diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis that has given me any relief close to being able to function.Since Dec 2018 have been in the worst painful flares in wrists & shoulders that WILL NOT go away! How long is a flare supposed to last? The only thing that was working to relieve the pain so I could get to work was 20mg prednisone. I tried to reduce,  flares came back with a vengeance!  Have been on Humira, which the only thing it did for me was caused me to have a severe sinus fungus that needed surgery! Was on Xelzanze that did nothing and now on IV Infusion Actemra going on 3 1/2 months & that is NOT working. I decided to get on the REAL CBD oil. I take 4 four x a day. After being on the CBD oil & 800 motrin I have been able to reduce to 12.5 prednisoneWhy continue to put this poison biologicals into my body when none of them work at all?",Anonymous
6,Prednisone,Rheumatoid Arthritis,10.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"July 11, 2019",35,"Severe R.A. as a side effect from Keytruda (cancer drug) Mostly in my fingers, hands, wrists and shoulders..So bad I could hardly get out of bed- until I was given prednisone. In my case 20mg/day is the magic number. It’s amazing to see how fast the pain and stiffness returned after only a few days of trying to reduce my daily dose to 15mg. After 10-12 weeks on 20mg/day I have gained 15 pounds and have both the moon face and abdominal weight gain. But, prior to the prednisone the pain was SO BAD it was almost suicidal! So I’ll take the side effects as long as I can live a productive, helpful life. I am VERY thankful that this drug exists!!!! ",Koke

I only had two days of relief after I took the 4th what am I going to expect for my six ? I just don't know if I can keep doing this without knowing something and my rheumatologist refuses to tell me anything. What should I do? Every morning I wake up with such severe pain in a different joints , It's unbelievably hard I have since also been to those diagnosed with a condition called  calcium pyrophosphate dihydrate (CPPD) crystal deposition disease. I don't know if that is what's making me the pain so much worse but I need help.",KarenMo
8,Prednisone,Rheumatoid Arthritis,9.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"July 22, 2018",29,"I was diagnosed with RA in June 2018. Was told by doctors and physical therapists before that  that it was osteoarthritis.  Once I saw a rheumatologist, that got straightened out.  She started me on Prednisone 20mg once a day and combined it with Methotrexate 10mg once a week.  Just finished my 5th week.  Reading all of these reviews about the different drugs is kind of scary.  I go back to the rheumatologist this next week for my first follow-up.  I have been lucky enough so far to not have any noticeable side effects.  So far, I guess I am just looking to learn more about all of this.",zoomsister
9,Prednisone,Rheumatoid Arthritis,8.0,,"April 9, 2018",50,"I was diagnosed with RA and had the opinion and experimentation of drugs from 6 different doctors and none worked. Until one day, my 7th Dr prescribed prednisolone (prednisone). Less than 24hrs after taking it, I felt so much better. I began to do things on my own again like hold a teacup, stand or walk faster than I had in almost 2 years. The pain I felt every night and woke with evey morning was now manageable. The moon face, weight gain were small prices to pay to be able to comb my own hair. I've weaned off from 20mg to 2.5mg per day and that was great. But after a flare I was forced to up my dosage again. Learning how to manage it with prednisone helps. Side effects of long term use is important, but having the ability to live a normal life while having RA is a gift. Do what works for you.",Nini
10,Prednisone,Rheumatoid Arthritis,9.0,,"November 6, 2017",83,"This medication is slowly but surely bringing me back to life. I've been going through a flare for about 5 months, with no resolve. Even tried depo medrol- intramusclelar shot. Which did nothing. I see reviews of people advising caution and saying you should NEVER take this drug. But what do you do if you're a 29yr old mom of 3 young children? Who works full time? Who can barely get out of bed? I will happily take moon face, happily meal plan to control weight gain, happily lose a little sleep. I will happily deal with these things in order to STAND without falling over, rock my baby to sleep without agonizing shoulder pain, make my children dinner and work! For me the benefits outweigh the risks! Do what is right for you!",RAmom890

After some research, (I was originally diagnosed with arthritis), I found my symptoms matched the condition of Polymyalgia Rheumatica exactly. My physician accommodated me with a 20mg. prescription for prednisone. After two doses, my months-long battle with pain was completely over. I literally felt as if I'd been born again in the physical sense. For me, this medication was miraculous. Fortunately, I have not suffered any of the side effects such as swelling, etc.Tapering off the medication, I've found that 5mg. is my threshold dose. Under that, the symptoms come back.",bekris

Out of the 4 Rheumatologists I have had, none have seen a case as aggressive as mine. Within 2 years I was completely bedridden and under the care of others. While the side effects are horrible (no sleep, infections, hair falling out, weight gain and moon face), I continue to ask for it in high doses.

Was put on prednisone which made me feel horrible. I weaned myself off of it and since then my arthritic pain has increased by 100%.  I also have polycystic kidney disease and hypothyroidism.

I have never felt worse in my life but for my burnt lung experience on Humira. My God what a terrible disease RA is. I wish something really helped. I wish there was some way to make the pain stop.

My RA started 2 years before Methotrexate and I was totally disabled for 2 years until I got in on clinical trials of MTX. The prednisone helped me get through flare ups and bad times. I would increase the dosage for a couple of days and ease the pain. Now I take 5mg a day every day to maintain myself. Now I am on disability due to my hands which are severely deformed.

23,Prednisone,Rheumatoid Arthritis,10.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"February 17, 2016",80,"Prednisone has been a saviour at being a quick fix in getting rid of my crippling RA symptoms. Started on 10mg a day with no side affects. Now into my 7th week on it and tapered down to 7.5mg I'm getting terrible side affects. Agitation, anxiety, mood swings, awful insomnia which worsens the mood swings and the lack of sleep then causes its own lot of side affects. I'm not sure what's worse right at this moment - pain in all my limb joints or these aggravating side affects?! I am writing this at a peak of a pouty mood swing though. I don't do well without sleep and 3 nights in a row with just a few hours between them is it. On a positive note I am almost fully mobile when on the drug.

24,Prednisone,Rheumatoid Arthritis,9.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"November 18, 2015",59,"I have a love/hate relationship with Prednisone.  It really helps when you need it.  In fact, sometimes, it's the ONLY thing that helps.  Over 20 years ago I was on it for my UC.  I never gained weight on it.  I did get the cute moon face though.  Recently I was diagnosed with another auto-immune disease.  NSAIDs didn't do anything to alleviate my pain.  I'm on Sulfasalazine and Methotrexate.  We started with 40 mg Prednisone and have tapered to 10 right now.  NEVER get off Prednisone cold turkey (If you've been on it for a while), your adrenals will pay.  You have to taper off.

I was prescribed Prednisone and within 1-2 days they worked, however, one of the side effects is weight gain. I do recommend them if you don't mind putting on a lot of weight.  I didn't stay on them because of this but have taken full strength Glucosomine every day for years, I think over time they have gradually repaired some damage to the joints. A lot of times I could feel an attack of arthritis coming on, I would feel extremely tired, words even slurred so I would take 1/2 to 1 Prednisone, no pain next day.",Rachael1122

My hips and shoulder still hurt even though I had no inflammation, my Dr. Said keep taking prednisone we'll taper it off slow. My doctor and I assumed this pain was normal arthritic pain and he never did X-rays. The pain in my hips got worse and worse.
