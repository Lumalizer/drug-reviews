1,Orencia,Rheumatoid Arthritis,8.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"September 3, 2021",0,"I liked this drug although it didn't stop my wrist pain. I had weekly injections and besides some issues with fatigue and diarrhea,  it was pretty good. I was taking it with Plaquenil as well. My rheumatologist has switched me to Rinvoq so we will have to see. Rinvoq has poor reviews so I am a little scared.",michelle72
2,Orencia,Rheumatoid Arthritis,9.0,,"July 8, 2021",5,"Severe RA became a part of my life 37 years ago, before the biologics were developed. 3 weeks after Enbrel came on the market, I started taking it in combo with hydroxychloroquine, sulfazalazine, methotrexate and NSAID. This combo worked for me for 17 years. It was a miracle. Then Enbrel effectiveness waned. I switched to Humira for about 8 months. Not effective. MD said I had probably developed auto antibodies to TNF alpha meds. I took xeljanz which did not help either. Then started injectable Orenica. After 3 months I was in a massive flare-up. I switched MDs and started Prednisone and IV Orencia 750/mo. Continued with hydroxychloroquine, MTX, sulfazalazine and NSAIDs. Flare up resolved in 6 months. Had to stop MTX last year due to severe crashing tinnitus. Continued the combo for 2 years. Now the IV Orencia is not available to me on Maui, so I am back on injectable Orencia 125 mg/wk.  Seems to be holding me. Thank goodness for Orencia.",Pollyanna
3,Orencia,Rheumatoid Arthritis,4.0,,"May 10, 2021",6,"My Vectra score came back at 55 (high disease activity), and it was time to figure out a new course of meds. Methotrexate injections didn't help with the pain and thinned my hair. Next up, biologics. Enbrel was a no go due to the possibility of heart failure and I was already experiencing high cardiac output. My first Orencia infusion was 2/11/2021. I experienced really bad HA's, lower bp and extreme fatigue. The HA's and lower bp subsided a little. My rheumy and the IV nurse said to stay with it because it does take time. After the fourth infusion, I began experiencing head & facial tingling causing my eye to freeze for a few seconds then stop. Tingling also in my left arm, dizziness, sore throat and stuffy nose. My rheumy she told me to stop the medication and offered Xeljanz. *long sigh* I really don't want to go on this medication tour and was really hoping Orencia would have worked. I heard so many good things from people who benefitted from it. Let's see what's next.",Ru

After having my daughter I went into a full on flare that I became crippled. Nothing was helping and I thought my life was over. But, they had me try Orencia and (although it took 3 months to kick in) it changed my life. I was finally able to carry my daughter and walk with her. I’ve been taking it for about 5 years. There are always going to be bad and good reviews. It just depends on your body.",Mstra92
5,Orencia,Rheumatoid Arthritis,4.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"January 7, 2021",13,"I was on Enbrel for over 15 years for RA. Shortly after I started on it I told my rheumatologist it was a miracle drug. I still had flares but the severe pain I had felt every day was pretty much gone. Then, after so many years, the pain started returning. My current rheumatologist switched me to Humira. After a month it seemed to be helping. But I was having nausea and a continuous headache with occasional dizziness. It was so bad I asked my rheumatologist to switch me to something else. She then put me on Orencia. I've been on it for 6 weeks but the pain I had before going on Humira has returned. And I also have nasal congestion 24/7. I'll give the Orencia a few more weeks, until my next appointment with my rheumatologist, and if the pain and congestion isn't any better, I'll see what she wants to do. As a side note, I've also been taking methotrexate for 15 years.",Jay

My white cells and platelets were above normal last time, which concerns me as I had a  blood clot 10 years ago in my lung. I have a lot of pain all over and I haven't a clue what it could be. Is it possible to have normal inflammatory marker and be still hurting? Thanks.",Jules

8,Orencia,Rheumatoid Arthritis,10.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"July 3, 2020",48,"This drug has been a great. Humira made me break out in a huge hot rash, and Leuflonamide (Arabs) made over half of my hair fall out and a full body rash for over 6 months with NO relief. While Arabs made my RA symptoms completely disappear, the side effects as a 35 yr old female were unacceptable. Orencia has very literally changed my life. I live in northern MN and with certain climate changes I still have minor joint stiffness, I am completely out of pain and the stiffness is 100 x’s better than what it was. I’m so very grateful for this drug.",Bri

11,Orencia,Rheumatoid Arthritis,7.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"February 6, 2020",37,"Worked great for 9 months. (moderate-severe with positive RA factor) Went off this for around three weeks due to a mix-up with co-pay. Now, two straight weeks of stomach rumbling and diarrhea. Probiotics, pepto-bismo nothing is helping. This is the only RA med that has worked for me, so I really hope my doctor can get me over this. I am on a copay plan through an assistance fund and they pay what Medicare/Anthem doesn't cover $1500/mth.

13,Orencia,Rheumatoid Arthritis,2.0,Taken for 5 to 10 years,"September 9, 2019",43,"Garbage! Like every biologic out there. They all suck. They all carry horrible side effects including death. Cancer, infectious, etc. I've tried just about every biologic out there including Humira, Enbrel, Cimzia...They all quit working within 6 months. I'm convinced that Orencia caused me severe food sensitivities. There's no other explanation form my severe food sensitivities. I get inflammation from a bunch of foods. Kale, spinach , nuts, beans, rice, all animal protein which is crazy. My list of foods that cause me inflammation immediately upon eating them is crazy and I didn't have that problem before starting Orencia about 7 years ago. My rheumatologist doesn't believe me. It's very frustrating. It's been 7 years since I started Orencia and my food sensitivities have gotten worse. I'm going to report it to the FDA as a side effect. I just hope they come up with a cure ASAP. Enough bandaids that cause cancer and infections..We need a cure.",Mae

I was on Humira for 10 years, which helped greatly but the side effects began showing so I was forced to stop. I was off all RA meds for a couple of years and my condition began deteriorating again. I went on Orencia IV drip. I began showing almost all of the side effects listed about a month after my first dose. It was slowly poisoning me. I was sick all the time and showing severe symptoms; Exhaustion, night sweats, back pain, migraines for 8 days straight, diarrhea, nausea and a level of discomfort I've never felt. It's an awful medicine with crippling side effects. It is important to note that the side effects were worse than the RA itself and my condition is moderate to severe. My suggestion is to avoid this medication at all cost. I was put on a anti nausea pill that is used for chemo patients. If you do some research you will find that 25% of the people on Orencia have a bad experience.",Orencia is poison

16,Orencia,Rheumatoid Arthritis,9.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"February 5, 2019",121,"This medication made sense to me. Why not try something that will block the entire inflammatory cascade over just one inflammatory protein like TNFa ?  All other Meds ( 5 others) were fails for me due to either no response or a severe reaction... Orencia was the answer to my prayers ... For me , it did take about 6 months to see elimination of joint inflammation... and about 9 months for Full effect of this drug. My advice is to be patient with these medications and just hang in there ...eventually, you will hit the right drug for you .  I have my life back now.  So grateful.",Robky

20,Orencia,Rheumatoid Arthritis,10.0,,"October 10, 2018",100,"This medication has worked spectacularly well for me.  I used to be on a cocktail including Humira, MTX, steroids and NSAIDS. I changed my diet and tried to go au natural for a few years...it worked for a while, but in my stubbornness, I experienced some joint damage.  So I was highly inflamed when I started the Orencia.  My rheumy and I picked this med because while on Humira, I was sick more than I was well.  Orencia has the reputation for causing less illness.  After five months, my inflammation has significantly decreased and I haven't had even a sniffle.That said, any medication has a higher potential to work for you if you are eating an anti-inflammatory diet and making sure you are not vitamin/mineral deficient.  Try an elimination diet so you can truly know what foods bother you. Most people aren't in tune enough with their bodies to know when a food is making their joints worse.  An elimination diet is key to getting in touch with your body and its response to food.",S
