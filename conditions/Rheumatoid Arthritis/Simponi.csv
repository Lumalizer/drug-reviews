0,Simponi,Rheumatoid Arthritis,1.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"March 17, 2022",1,"I started Simponi infusions , just recently my first infusion was fine, made me a bit tired but no side effects and no effects at all, my 2nd infusion was 3 weeks ago, I again was tired after the infusion but I was more tired than usual , I started not feeling real great, the next day I felt even worse I believe every side effect that this drug has I had, fever, cold chills, nausea, extremely fatigued, headache, my whole body has and still is swelled up 2 x more than normal, having trouble breathing I then ended up with sinus infection and then pneumonia. Let me say that I have been dealing with RA/Fibromyalgia for the past 23 years, I have been on everything and anything that is available as suffice to say nothing has worked for me, however I never had any side effects to this magnitude with the others. I am glad this works for others and was really hoping to finally get some relief but I guess my body is rejecting this medication so I feel I had better listen to it.",Anonymous

Sometimes on my arms and backs of my hands. It itches terribly, but clears up within 30 minutes to an hour. But it's been happening everyday for about 2 weeks now.

4,Simponi,Rheumatoid Arthritis,5.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"June 16, 2020",9,"I started taking infusion about 20 months ago.First year things appeared to go smoothly.  Then I started experiencing weakness in right shoulder. Physical therapist diagnosed muscle deterioration and spent 3 months in therapy. Regained some of the strength then slipped and fell breaking ankle bone on both sides requiring surgery, pins, and plate in ankle. Never had a broken bone before!!It went down hill from there. Have had 2 infusions since and have had weakness in other shoulder, urinary infection. Horrible headaches, knees giving out and painful, sore wrists.  Tire easily, weight gain, Blu-ray vision at times.  I think it’s time to re-evaluate the benefits of this drug as I have went downhill quickly the past year",Cooper

Diagnosed at age 53, 17 years ago. Have had both knees replaced and have carpal tunnel pain in one thumb. At same time as the infections  it was discovered I had a cat allergy. These two factors together meant my body could not get rid of the chest infections & ear infections because of the constant cat allergy creating stuffed up conditions#5 Simponi Infusion in Sept to give it one last chance but since #1 Infusion was in April I have developed finger movement and pain. bunions. RA flares in second toe and a foot joint,  plus fatigue has sucked the interest in life right out of me. I felt great for 10 days this month on a Prednisone burst but am weaning off it next week.

8,Simponi,Rheumatoid Arthritis,1.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"August 22, 2018",74,My wife was administered simponi infusionsPrior to the infusions she was a healthy active lady. She suffered from RA which was addressed with methatraxe and predozon..The she was switched to Simponi.She started exhibited all the side effects of this drug. She detetiorated very fast.Today she's laying in an ICU fighting for her life. Doctors claim the major contributor to her ailing health was the Simponi. It's effects etc are irreversible. So. If you intend to go on this drug. Please research it and be very carefully monitored. It creeps on you and could kill you. It has turned my wife from a healthy active working woman to a physically and mentally incapacitated. Even if she pulls through this ICU nightmare. We have years of recovery. If any.It is a shame these kind of drugs are allowed.Even if it effects/kills/handicaps on person it should be  removed from the shelf,George

I have tried every biologic there is and Simponi has been the first drug to work for me within a few hours. I take simpono and self inject every 2 weeks, I also take low dose prednisone. I was diagnosed at age 6,  have many replaced joints and still some active joints with severe RA.

I then was put on Remicade which took away every pain I had but on third infusion, I had an allergic reaction so I had to be taken off.  Now I am on Simponi and by the third infusion, I have had no pain at all and no side effects.  I am on Medicare which pays for 80% and my UHC which pays the 20%...so I feel really lucky.",Rosie bell

In Canada my doctor got me lined up for Simponi and once I started they will give it to me free of charge. The drug company pays for it. I am very lucky. I have been in remission for since I started it 4 years ago.  Colin,ColinF
12,Simponi,Rheumatoid Arthritis,10.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"May 16, 2017",45,I have had RA since 1987 and tried pretty much every drug and biologic out there. After a few weeks on Simponi  (2011) I swore that I was completely cured of my RA. Unfortunately the manufacturer does not give financial assistance to people on Medicare so I had to get off the best drug that ever worked and have been deteriorating ever since. Shame on Johnson & Johnson for not having compassion on patients who can't afford their drug. BIG DRUG COMPANIES!!!,treeod

No ill effects with the exception of exhaustion...additional that is as I already am sleeping 16 hours per day. Not sure how a person is supposed to make a living with this advanced RA.  I am hoping that Simponi will resolve that in the near future Will let you know when things start to work and I can return to the land of the living.,gregoryj

Because of side effects I began a very stringent diet, (specific carbohydrate diet).I eventually got better and all UC symptoms stopped. Years later went off the diet and was soon reduced to suffering immensely with undiagnosed  RA symptoms.I believe  my diet  contributes to my symptoms. I know food chemicals  can cause inflammation  and I know UC is cousin to RA. I  come from generations of alcoholics and am recovering  for 27 years.

20,Simponi,Rheumatoid Arthritis,2.0,,"July 7, 2016",93,"After my wife was taking Simponi for about a year under the direction of  her arthritis doctor, she came down with a rare neurological condition called CIDP (chronic inflamatory dimylating polyneurothapy) where she became almost totally paralized .   I think that the drug Simponi is very dangerous to take and she still can't walk after 2 years after stopping the drug.  She has to take infusions of IVIG  gamma globulin every third week to rebuild her nerves after the erosion of the myelin of the nerves took place.  This is a very serious side effect that no one has addressed.  I am sure that others have had this side effect hit them from taking Simponi.

For a newly married athlete at age 23, the pain from RA and the thought of living the rest of my life crippled with pain - took a huge toll on me.  I felt ashamed as a man and as a husband/potential father. Fortunately, I have had great Docs work hard to help me get well.  I have been on plaquenil, sulfazalazine, methotrexate, enbrel, cimzia, and simponi.  Each med had some positive results but some had harsh negative side effects too.

The Humira ""pen"" just plain hurts. So I used the prefilled syringes of Humira.The Simponi ""pen"" works great!! Painless, fast and easier to use.
