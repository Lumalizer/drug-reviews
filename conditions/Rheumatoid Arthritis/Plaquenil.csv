0,Plaquenil,Rheumatoid Arthritis,2.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"March 13, 2022",0,"I developed sudden paralysis in my right leg about a year ago.  After being hospitalized, and subjected to a variety of medications, my condition deteriorated until I needed a walker to even stand up - and was only staying awake about 3 hours per day. Finally,   I asked to be tested for RA. Very positive results. On my first visit to the rheumatologist, she prescribed hydroxychloroquine.   I had reacted severely to other medications, so I started with 1/2 prescribed dose - one 100 mg pill with supper daily.  Within two days, I could stand and walk independently for short distances.  Within a week, I was walking and driving and staying awake throughout the day.  This was like a wonder drug...and then I started to get serious cramps in my intercostal muscles so that I felt that I was being crushed and could not breath.  I ceased to be able to feel my hands and feet.  It took over two months for this to stop after quitting the pills, and I still show some liver/kidney damage.",bjaques
1,Plaquenil,Rheumatoid Arthritis,10.0,Taken for 10 years or more,"January 23, 2022",0,I have been on it for about 11 years. I haven't had any side effects at all. All I know is this. My disease is better . These reasons make me a fan of the drug. If you stop this drug your disease can get worse.

2,Plaquenil,Rheumatoid Arthritis,,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"August 1, 2021",1,"I have been on Plaquenil for over two years now for my moderate to severe RA. Having tried multiple medications that made little to no difference I was excited about the drug that finally helped. I am taking it in conjunction with a weekly injection of Actemra.Now I am dealing with vision problems that worsened in the past past two years and an uncontrollable irritability and low mood. Things are so bad mentally, that I lost all my social connections and having a very hard time communicating with the closest family members. I am in my late thirties and I feel like my life is falling apart because of the devastating effects this drug has on my mental health.",Olga
3,Plaquenil,Rheumatoid Arthritis,8.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"July 18, 2021",1,"I've been taking Plaquenil twice a day for erosive arthritis. It seems to make me extra drowsy when I work night shift. When I sleep I have VERY weird, detailed, and realistic dreams bordering on nightmares in a few cases, but just bizarre in the majority of cases. The dreams are so weird I don't share the details with anyone like I used to do. Last night's dream had me partially conscious and at one point I raised my arm to defend myself from an attacker (in the dream) and I was aware of doing it. Weird, huh? I've always had realistic dreams but the Plaquenil really took them to the next level! Also, the dream seemed like it went on for hours.",Leah

I took Plaquenil with full adherence of 300mg/d dosage hence positive effect on fingers & toes and body tenders hit in only on month 6, however it did not help me with upper back pain at all. AS was ruled out with HLA-B27(-), movement capacity and clean spine MRI though.The side effects: skin rash (persisted during first 3 months), stomach pain (few times), diarrhea (persisted during first 3 months now occasionally) and muscle twitches (intensive first month, then milder and I ignore them, maybe not due to HCQ)Nevertheless I'm going to visit my rheumo in coming weeks to discuss my never relieved morning upper back pain.",George

Most attacks would severely limit my physical abilities. The doctor suggested Humira, I was little reluctant - too many side effects to think about. She said we could try Plaquenil - a milder drug. I was told it takes two months before patients feel any improvement, it took little less for the drug to kick in.  Now, it's been a year - I have no flares, no pain and no side effects I can think of. I take one pill in the morning, one in the evening.  This drug works well for me.",Mike

It took a few weeks to see it work  but what a change for the better. Less painful joints and fatigue. Always have gotten retina checked and have been good. Then I started getting debilitating migraines. I went off my meds one by one and the GENERIC was to blame. My pharmacy switched to another foreign cheap manufacturing co. My doctor told me many generics change their fillers which cause side effects. Since I’ve been off I have declined rapidly. I’m trying to find assistance for original brand. It’s outrageous that we are forced to get generics! Especially if a person has a reaction we should be able to get brand at same or reasonable prices. Which they are not. This drug was so helpful for me and its worth a try, give it 2-6 months. Good luck!",Ace

I had pains in both knees, left wrist, hips, groin area & jaw so my Rheumatologist prescribed Hydroxychloroquine. After only 10 days I developed a terrible lumpy rash on my legs which was hot & itchy. It spread quickly to my abdomen, bottom arms & back, then I got a sore throat & swollen top lip! I stopped the tablets on the 12th day but the rash still spread. My GP put me on Steroids & Antihistamines. Hopefully this will stop the rash.

20,Plaquenil,Rheumatoid Arthritis,9.0,,"November 13, 2018",79,"I've been on a roller coaster for yrs w/Plaquenil for RA/Lupus. I take name brand to prevent side effects of red, warm, swollen, painful hands + nausea/dizziness, hair loss, etc. Each time I try going back to generic, side effects return immediately. I'm not one to comment but I read so many reviews that sounded like either my ups or downs, so I want to encourage ppl to stick w/this med & try name brand (though expensive) if having bad side effects w/generic. It could explain why some ppl have such opposite experiences. I get Plaquenil from international pharm & it's much cheaper. It works better than biologics that contributed to/sped up process leading to my cancer. I'm now ""cancer-free"" & refuse to go back on them. I might have to get vision checked & deal w/other mild side effects, but pain/swelling is gone on Plaquenil. Anyway, pls hang in there & give your body enough time to adjust to med before stopping it. It's a risk vs. reward scenario w/meds.",Holly
21,Plaquenil,Rheumatoid Arthritis,1.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"October 16, 2018",34,"When first diagnosed 3 yrs ago, my rheumy wanted to try Plaquenil first. He did tell me that some people develop allergies to the drug. Sure enough, three months in I developed hives all over my body. Had to stop the drug. Now I have Kenalog injections every 5-6 months which have worked well for me. No side effects and I am returned to my pre-RA self. Plaquenil is a great treatment for many; just not for me. Every person's physiology is different. My GP has also been researching some older drugs that he thinks were back-burnered due to new biologics. I'm researching as well.",Autumn

24,Plaquenil,Rheumatoid Arthritis,9.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"March 23, 2018",51,I started on plaquenil for Psoriatic Arthritis in 2015. (200mg twice daily). I didn’t feel too bad but a huge bout of stress made my symptoms worse. I then started methotrexate in addition to plaquenil. My rheumatologist suggested once daily  Plaquenil and that seemed okay. After a while he said I coujd stop it as he was not sure if it was working. I tapered off the dose and I slowly began feeling dreadful. The fatigue was awful and I had weird signs akin to severe fibro. I then started back on twice daily plaquenil. Within two weeks I began to feel more human and six months later the fatigue is greatly improved. The small joints in my hand and my wrists are less sore: still painful but improved. I can do more now and feel like doing more. I still have some bad fatigue days and the rheumatologist is still talking about biologicals but for the moment I’m happy to see how I go. None of these drugs are perfect but  at this stage plaquenil is really helping me.,Amber2

Due to the fact, I could not use my hands because of the swelling, I risked the possible vision problems.  By 2012, symptom free and still fearful of vision loss, I stopped the drug.   I was pain and symptom free for one year, but now symptoms have returned, and I have been told to restart the drug(no prednisone.)  In the 4 years taking it, I went from 95 lbs. to 85 lbs., lost a significant amount of  hair, had cataract surgery and, now, macular degeneration.

It has helped with the pain in my hands and feet.  I still have swollen fingers but am waiting for the full affects of the drug.  I do not know how common this is but the side effect that I am having is hair loss.  I am guessing it wouldn't be as bad if I was a male but being a female.  I am hoping this stops after my body gets used to the medicine because I am very discouraged with that aspect.,The Law

It didn't remove all inflammation so I was taken off and tried on methotrexate, a lot worse side effects and no relief at all. I had no vision changes with Plaquenil and I would much rather have some relief than none. I was able to function with minimum pain with Plaquenil.",peanut61

I started out with 200 mg/1x day along with Prednisone to treat my RA, slowly tapering off the steroids. Now I am just on Plaquenil.I have to say that the pain is still there, especially in the morning and late evening. Sometimes it is difficult to fall asleep, but I gave it a 6 because it is nothing like before when I took no medication.  Perhaps it works better for others?  I still have the swelling and stiffness in the mornings, but, as I said, nothing like before.It also only gets a 6 because the headaches I get while taking it are debilitating.  I sometimes wonder if the trade off is worth it?  They start about 30 minutes after taking it and last until I manage to fall asleep. Sigh.",RA Mom

I'm now seeing the benefits and my Rheumatologist says that I should continue to get even better over the next 3 months. Honestly I'm okay with where I'm already at.   The biggest surprise is that I'm receiving benefits that I didn't get from 20mg/day of Prednisone!  The hardest part was when I first began Plaquenil. You initially experience side effects without any benefit but you just have to hang in there.  The side effects start to improve significantly after 2 weeks. My side effects were nausea, loose stools, vomiting and temporary changes in vision (full eye exam confirmed that everything is fine.) I would highly recommend this medicine!",Anonymous
