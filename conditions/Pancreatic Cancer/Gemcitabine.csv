0,Gemcitabine,Pancreatic Cancer,10,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"March 11, 2018",20,"Gemzar (gemcitabine):On Gemzar for three years following diagnosis on late stage pariampullary cancer that had spread to my liver (had already had the Whipple).Combined initially with Abraxane. Tumors cleared up, CAT-19-9 went back to normal. I realize I'm not a typical case. Few side effects,  mostly fatigue, no nausea.  Had to suspend at one point due to anemia. However, seems to be losing effectiveness lately as CA-19-9 slowly elevating.",Mark G.

Been on it for three months and have three months more to go.  Take good 3 wkd off one week. So far good compared to vomiting, extreme fatigue and hair loss from the Cisplatin that I was taking last year.  Thank u Jesus.",Pharmacina

3,Gemcitabine,Pancreatic Cancer,7,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"August 9, 2012",116,"Gemzar (gemcitabine):While my oncologist could not conclude that GEMZAR was effective in my case, I have survived late-stage metastatic pancreatic cancer for more than 6 years since beginning my first (of 2) treatment regimen. Absent any other explanation, I must consider the possibility that GEMZAR was instrumental in my survival.  I've been told I have exceptional tolerance for GEMZAR, and I ultimately had 54 infusions over 2-and-a-half years, with a one-year gap. The side effects were minimal in my case (most frequent: flu-like symptoms, mild infections), and I was able to conduct relatively normal work & life routines, although I frequently had to battle a high level of fatigue.",NYwhipple
