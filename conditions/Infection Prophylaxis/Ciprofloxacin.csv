0,Ciprofloxacin,Infection Prophylaxis,1,Taken for less than 1 month,"August 30, 2016",7,"Cipro (ciprofloxacin):DO NOT USE THIS DRUG.I used it for post vasectomy infection preventionHorrible drug with crazy side effects. I can't believe that this is legal to prescribe except for emergencies.I only took 2 pills and 3 days later I still have aches and pains in joints all over my body. Joints are stiff and I have to walk slowly. Now I have to worry about a possible tendon rupture even months from now.I also have tinnitus (ringing in my ears) which is CONSTANT. After taking the very first pill I felt light-headed, out-of-it and almost passed out. I should never have taken the 2nd.This drug is insanely overpowered and should only be used if there is no alternative. It attacks your joints, tendons, muscles, digestive tract and nervous system.",Post Vasectomy Pain
