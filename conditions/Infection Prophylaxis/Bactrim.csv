1,Bactrim,Infection Prophylaxis,,,"September 28, 2017",5,My 13yr old daughter has DiGeorge syndrome and she was on a number of meds. They had no interactions. But shortly after giving her this med (to prevent ear infections that she is prone to) she began to have seizures. I thought it was the bactrim and I think I was right. The Drs wouldn't listen. To me so I did my own tests. I took her off the bactrim for 6 months and she was fine.  Then they said put her back on it.  So against my better judgment I did and with in 4 days she was having seizures again. So I decided to not give it to her. Anyway they called dcs on me. And took my kids away. Now I'm fighting for them. But at my last court date they threw 5hose charges out.,Tarahelper
