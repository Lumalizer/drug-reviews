0,Bactrim DS,Infection Prophylaxis,1,Taken for less than 1 month,"March 1, 2020",0,"My poor son had terrible side effect from bactrim ds : high fevers (without rash) started on day 3, worse with each dose. This landed him in hospital.   A fever side effect is rare. A fever WITHOUT rash is even more rare. Do not let anyone tell you it doesn't happen. It happened to me many years ago, and then it happened to my son, only so much worse!",No Man

2,Bactrim DS,Infection Prophylaxis,10,,"December 4, 2011",27,"I've been taking this pill for almost my entire life to help keep off bad infections and it's been a miracle worker for me (I don't have any natural immunity, was born that way) so this pill helps me avoid any bad infections and thus far has worked great. I've never experienced any side effects from it.",Anonymous
