This landed him in hospital.   A fever side effect is rare. A fever WITHOUT rash is even more rare. Do not let anyone tell you it doesn't happen. It happened to me many years ago, and then it happened to my son, only so much worse!",No Man

2,Sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim,Infection Prophylaxis,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"September 12, 2018",6,"Doc prescribed this to treat a bartholin cyst which was not infected in hopes of avoiding infection. After a couple days, I thought I was coming down with the flu. Sore throat, stiff neck, severe back pain, nausea, really red irritated eyes, my skin hurt, joint pain, fatigue, fever, headache, and loss of appetite. Stopped taking them to try other meds to treat ""flu"". My husband suggested it might be the drugs making me sick. Tried them again weeks later and within a few hours, symptoms returned. Cyst is still here.",Joflo
3,Sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim,Infection Prophylaxis,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"March 30, 2018",3,"This was prescribed to me after surgery to remove a sebaceous cyst. Ten doses, to be taken over 5 days. I was so nauseous, I could not eat anything. My legs muscles hurt so bad, I could barely stand up, let alone walk. I was shaky, weak, and felt like I had the flu. Although it made me feel foggy-headed and drowsy, I was unable to sleep for more than an hour at a time. It is the worst medication I have EVER taken.",DMW

I tried soaking, tea tree oil and a lot of other homeopathic remedies.  The boil persisted for 3 months.  75$ for an urgent care visit, $4.00 for a 10 day prescription for it...4 days later, it's gone!  Yes, a little nausea at first...ALWAYS take it on a full stomach.",LBKRHFY
5,Sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim,Infection Prophylaxis,,,"September 28, 2017",5,Bactrim (sulfamethoxazole / trimethoprim):My 13yr old daughter has DiGeorge syndrome and she was on a number of meds. They had no interactions. But shortly after giving her this med (to prevent ear infections that she is prone to) she began to have seizures. I thought it was the bactrim and I think I was right. The Drs wouldn't listen. To me so I did my own tests. I took her off the bactrim for 6 months and she was fine.  Then they said put her back on it.  So against my better judgment I did and with in 4 days she was having seizures again. So I decided to not give it to her. Anyway they called dcs on me. And took my kids away. Now I'm fighting for them. But at my last court date they threw 5hose charges out.,Tarahelper
6,Sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim,Infection Prophylaxis,1.0,,"September 20, 2016",1,"Yesterday I  took my first dose as an infection preventative so that my toe nail that was butchered off by a nail shop would not get infected. Two hours later my tongue was painful and felt heavy and swollen, my throat tightened and a sore of some sort popped up inside the inner cheek of my mouth. It was hard and painful like an abscess. My eyes turned blood shot red. I have been looking like a GD zombie for almost 24hrs. 12 hours later after taking the medication yesterday my tongue is no longer sore, but today the sore in mouth is still present. The sore no longer hurts though. I'm itching like crazy, and I'm having flu like symptoms.",ToeGurl
