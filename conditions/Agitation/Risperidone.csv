0,Risperidone,Agitation,7.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"August 5, 2021",1,"Incredibly important part of my med regime. This medication eliminates my extreme agitation instantly. It helps a lot with OCD intrusive thoughts and also helped me control my actions better. I was very worried that I would need a long term hospitalization before I started this med. it’s very good at calming you down when you’re unstable/out of control. The only downside is that it made me a little depressed when I started, although that went away when I started taking an antidepressant. This med also helped me work through some delusions. I do find every six months I need to up my dose, but that hasn’t been a major problem yet as I’m on a very low dose. I’d recommend it to anyone who’s being suggested it, but be warned that when you start it you may be really sleepy. It goes away after a month. Good to note though that this will effect everyone differently, and I’ve heard some bad stories before.",Othraccountt17
1,Risperidone,Agitation,1.0,,"February 24, 2020",11,I've been on respiridone for about 4-5 months worst antipsychotic I've ever taken. From the first day I took it I felt strange very agitated I just didn't  understand why I was feeling like this then over excitement. I admit it helped my delusional thoughts and going out. I want to stop this drug but I think they won't give me another one to try help. What would help with agitation as they said I'm not allowed diazapam anymore I'm stuck for any ideas,betrayed

3,Risperidone,Agitation,10.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"April 15, 2019",21,"I wrote the other glowing review of this medication and I couldn’t figure out how to update it.  But I wanted to give people hope who are trying this medication.  My son has now been on it for 5 months and the positive changes have been amazing - his problems were irritable behavior, anger and aggression .  We were able to go on vacation as a family for the first time because of it.  My son was excited, happy and had so much fun.  A year ago I thought he was going to need to be institutionalized.  I know everyone is different and this medication can be harsh on the body but my son is really doing great on it! Start off on a small dose.  My son takes .25 mg/day and it is having a huge impact.",Mom
4,Risperidone,Agitation,3.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"October 2, 2018",16,"My parents put me on this medication because they feel like I have had problems with anger. I can control it around my friends at school, but my parents know how to work me up and get on my nerves and I yell at them.So they put me on it for anger control medicine. I have anxiety and depression. This med has only made me feel so numb, I hardly feel happiness anymore. I have only felt happiness maybe 10 times this year and its October. I get bursts of anxiety, depression, sometimes I feel a little anger but not a lot, but I hardly feel happiness. I feel like a robot and not real.It also gives me twitches sometimes, memory issues, dizziness every single time I get up from laying down, and a fast heartbeat.I'm sick of the way I feel. I cant wait to get off of this medicine to get an anxiety one. Hopefully it wont make me feel this numb.",k
5,Risperidone,Agitation,1.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"August 17, 2017",7,Not sure if I want my child who has aggression to take this because Dr. says it could cause diabetes! My family has a history of diabetes so why should I allow my 10 yr old daughter to take this pill and ruin her life with diabetes! Also my 10 yr old was the tiniest out of my 1st born and I believe she has gained a lot of weight but the Dr. claims she didn't gain any! For being 10 she weighs 75 lbs. She is 1/4 of the way to being the the same weight as my 16 yr old. Don't think I want to wait another 6 yrs to see what her weight is then!:(,Shawndeebrit
6,Risperidone,Agitation,4.0,Taken for 5 to 10 years,"July 8, 2017",12,"Back in my early 20's, I started experiencing severe agitation, anxiety, mood swings, and couldn't think straight, along with OCD etc. I finally went to see a psychiatrist. He put me on Paxil, Klonopin, and Risperdal. When I 1st started this combo of drugs, I felt very good, very clear headed. It almost seemed like I was myself again. After a few years, the side effects started brewing. My anxiety returned in full force, my thoughts were disorganized once again, and I began itching all over my body, especially my legs and feet. My bladder went bad. Gained weight. From the get go, Risperdal made me EXTREMELY ANXIOUS upon taking it.  It was the culprit behind my itchy skin and bladder issues too. BE CAREFUL. Caused SEVERE INNER RESTLESSNESS!",Birdman80
7,Risperidone,Agitation,3.0,,"July 30, 2015",20,"I've been taking it since I was 10 or 11 when I had really bad anger, but after I read some reviews lately of the drug and seen that it does more harm than good I have decided to quit and see what I was like off it. So far I realized it made me super sensitive to light and made the world brighter than it really is.  Also now I realize I haven't seen the real world for how many years knowing this makes me sad. Another side affect is suppressed emotions and now that I'm off I'm more happy and can feel emotions more and their not dulled. They made my memory bad like I could barely remember what I did yesterday and it was hazy. Made me lethargic and gave me a monster appetite, btw I found out I don't have anger issues anymore.",Buying gf
