1,Citalopram,Agitation,,Taken for 10 years or more,"October 25, 2018",16,"I have been on various doses of Citalopram for ten years. I feel good on it, except that I don't feel empathy for people. I don't cry anymore. I feel empathy for animals, strange I know, but thats how I am now. I took Citalopram initially for depression, I continue taking it because of irritability.",Bwabbles
2,Citalopram,Agitation,10.0,,"September 15, 2016",27,"I went to my Primary Care physician b/c I was constantly irritated with my boyfriend and wondered if there was anything that might help make me get less irritated less often.  The doctors said he had had success with several patients improving irritability with Citalopram.  I never really felt any big change, but within a few weeks, the irritability was drastically reduced.  The anger was much more in check.  Someone else described it this way...life just seemed smoother/easier to manage.  My attitude became more positive.  I became much more content with my life overall.",Girl in the Park

4,Citalopram,Agitation,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"June 18, 2016",15,"I was prescribed these as my Doctor insisted that I was suffering from anxiety/agitation. I was not keen on taking these but I did as I thought the Doctor knows best.The first week I suffered most of the common side effects like dry mouth, tiredness, and feeling sick. By the second week these had gone except for the extreme tiredness and now my heart felt like it was pounding hard in my chest and I felt more anxious!After 18 days I was feeling worse than ever and went back to see my Doctor who then advised I should stop taken the 10mg dosage. After 2 days I feel so much better for stopping and dont know why I was ever put on them !Terrible medication with so many bad side effects!!",mark_2306
