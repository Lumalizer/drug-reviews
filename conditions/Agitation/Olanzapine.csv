0,Olanzapine,Agitation,10,Taken for less than 1 month,"March 3, 2022",0,"Can everybody relax? Keep taking the medication for some weeks like you're supposed to like literally every med.First week was rough. I had Anxiety-induced suicidal thoughts, anxiety  and  I was inpatient and had trouble getting up for group therapy. I was so groggy. This is my second week and I'm much better, my suicidal thoughts are mostly gone. We lowered the dose and WHAM, they came right back and I couldn't sleep.So now I'm discharged and on 10mg, I'm able to draw, watch TV, play solitaire, talk to my brother without freaking out somehow. I can even go to the grocery store without being overly paranoid that people are out to get me.My brother says I'm snoring now, that probably means I'm sleeping better too.",Shell
1,Olanzapine,Agitation,1,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"February 21, 2022",0,"I was out on this while having an anxiety attack. I was misdiagnosed as psychotic and put on this horrific med.It screwed up my life for a year. Confusion, worse anxiety, drugged feeling, non rational thoughts. My doc took me off and I crashed, had to go to the hospital and I was only on 10 mg a day. The hospital tried to put me back on it and I refused. It’s been a month and I still feel like it changed me permanently.Maybe it works for people who need it but it will mess you up if you don’t.",amyclarkere
2,Olanzapine,Agitation,1,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"January 21, 2022",1,"Let me warn all of you. I have been on this medicine for 2 years. Kept it because it lessened my anxiety. But any motivation you had prior will be shot. I'm now attempting to get off and it is the WORST withdrawal process. Unable to swallow, nausea. TERRIBLE insomnia. Please. Please.  I would give anything to go back to before I was prescribed this.",Mandiem92
3,Olanzapine,Agitation,10,Taken for 10 years or more,"January 14, 2022",0,"This drug has been a life saver for me.  My diagnosis is major depressive disorderI generally take it now and again but has helped immensely with agitation and suicidal thoughts and basically stops me spiralling out of control.   I think there are many times I would have been admitted without it.    Also, I am thankful for my Psychiatrist for prescribing it for me.  He told me that it would stop the suicidal thoughts and it did.   Thankyou Dr I would really recommend it as an as needed drug.",denise528
4,Olanzapine,Agitation,9,Taken for less than 1 month,"January 6, 2022",3,"I wanted to share my experience with 2.5 mg Olanzapine. I was having severe anxiety every day that started each morning when I woke up, and it started after I tried bupropion xl. I am also on Lexapro and Gabapentin for depression and anxiety. I stopped the Bupropion xl but still had really bad anxiety. After trying clonidine that sort of worked, my doctor suggested olanzapine and warned me about potential weight gain. After reading reviews and researching the side effects, I was scared. I decided that my anxiety was bad enough that I weighed the risks and tried the medication. Within about 30 minutes I felt a bit calmer. After a few days, I felt a greater sense of calm. I don't wake up with severe anxiety anymore. I can sleep through the night and I just make sure to take the medicine around 7pm-8pm and I'm able to wake up around 7am. It has only been about a week on the med, but I am happy I decided to try it because my anxiety is better.",Lakesideguy
5,Olanzapine,Agitation,8,Taken for less than 1 month,"November 24, 2021",2,"I got olanzapine for benzo withdrawals, also for insomnia and anxiety/panic.This works very well with really low side effects at least for me, it eases the withdrawals, anxious mind and calms the body. I know this is used to treat psychosis etc but with low dosages (I have 1-2 half tablet a day) it works very well.Causes a bit of a sweet tooth but I can live with it",Hesekiel
6,Olanzapine,Agitation,9,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"November 3, 2021",0,"Game changer. Had not slept for five weeks, anxiety so bad, racing thoughts. Slept a full night the first night and every night since.Started on a high dose (20mg), but quickly cut that down to 5mg (with escitalopram 20mg) because of metabolic side effects (I’m diabetic and this drug is not good for diabetes) and weight gain.By the time I taper off it will have been about three months. Will update any problems with taper and after cessation.I gave a 9/10 just because of the nasty side effects….",Kevin
7,Olanzapine,Agitation,9,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"September 16, 2021",10,"I first was given olanzapine while hospitalized.  I am bipolar (I stay hypermanic) and had amphetamine addiction.  They gave me olanzapine oral tab as needed for agitation.  I remember the first dose. It was like I put on the brakes heavily but not too fast. I didn't feel drugged.  Everything just slowed down fast.  I was like ""Is this what normal people feel like?""  However, I refused to go on it permanently due to side effects of weight gain. Probably stupid, but like I said, I was a meth head, so there's your wisdom.  I have a bottle of 10 mg for hyper-manic states, anxiety or agitation. I don't take it often, but when I do it's amazing.  I just calm the heck down. I'm also on 1500mg of lithium and 20mg of latuda.  I was better on the latuda but had akathisia and extreme nervousness at 40mg or higher.  Anecdotally, the olanzapine helped when said nervousness was unbearable (like when I would squirm upside down in a chair and drive everyone around me nuts).",GettingBetter

10,Olanzapine,Agitation,9,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"August 5, 2021",17,"I found Olanzapine to be a fantastic alternative to benzos for agitation. I wasn't keen on taking benzos again due to risk of becoming addicted. I find Olanzapine kicks in quite quickly and definitely helps to calm me down if I'm feel agitated or anxious. I take this as well as a tetracyclic antidepressant. I find it does make it hard to wake up in the morning, but the plus is that I get a great night's sleep on this medication. Weight gain is a side effect, but I was underweight before taking it so that worked well for me. Of course it's always good to be aware of long-term side effects for atypical APs and I'm personally tapering off with my doctor now that my mental health is improving.",Lil

12,Olanzapine,Agitation,4,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"December 27, 2020",5,"I used in conjugation with Lexapro. This stuff was pretty strong, and really helped with my anxiety, racing thoughts, and even chronic pain. However, it made me feel like a zombie and put me to sleep. About an hour or two after taking it around 7 p.m. I would just fall asleep, no matter where I was. I'd take it and fall asleep in the middle of playing video games with my friends. Basically became a narcoleptic. As for the weight gain, I constantly craved sugar and carbs. Sometimes it would make me so hungry I would eat hamburger buns after dinner because I still starving. I gained about 20 pounds. After working off the medication, I lost that 20 pounds again. The stuff makes you ravenously hungry, be warned. I've been off the stuff for about a year, and that's probably for the better.",Wheatley

14,Olanzapine,Agitation,9,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"November 12, 2020",36,"I have been taking olanzapine for about 3 years for anxiety and the associated agitation. I started on a low dose and this has gradually been increased to the maximum of 20 mg. Olanzapine has made a huge positive difference to my life. I am so much more relaxed, calmer and able to keep things in perspective. I am no longer stressed by minor stresses and able to cope with changes in my life much better. Before I started taking this drug I was getting extremely tense and wound up on a daily basis. Sometimes I was so nervous and on-edge I could barely make a cup of coffee with out feeling like I was going to crack up.",Sawdust
15,Olanzapine,Agitation,9,Taken for less than 1 month,"October 21, 2020",13,I’ve been on Zyprexa for 2 days now and it has made such a huge difference. My mind was always racing and thinking all day long and could not sleep prior to taking it. These past 2 nights I’ve slept 5 to 6 hrs and I’m calm throughout the day and am focused enough to work and I can now be productive when working. I was prescribed 5MG tablets but cut the tablets in half so that I only consume 2.5MG and it seems to be working fine. I am very hesitant on taking this medication because I don’t want to have to take it the rest of my life so I’m thinking not taking it going forward even though it’s doing the job. I wish I could’ve been prescribed this while my marriage was on good terms.,Mike
16,Olanzapine,Agitation,1,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"October 7, 2020",9,"At the beginning of the first two weeks taking 5mg of olazapine and coming off of 200 mg of lamictal, I ""thought"" things were going good. But after the two weeks and increasing to 7.5 mg, things were a wreck. Brain fog, increased anxiety, agitation and the major effect that everyone mentions.... weight gain!! One month, 10 lbs. I was constantly eating. Thank goodness my doctor let me try something different. This med was just not for me. I was so hoping it would have been too.",Tee
17,Olanzapine,Agitation,1,,"September 30, 2020",11,I was put on olanzapine for one and half years. At the 10 months mark I got shocking palpitatons that was August 2019 so dose cut down to three quarters and then kept cutting the dose down even more. I have been off nearly 5 months still have nausea every morning and no appetite. I have got heart problems from it can't go gym now  and believe this drug should be banned.  I am taking doctor to ombudsman who are taking on the case,Ruthie
18,Olanzapine,Agitation,9,,"August 4, 2020",8,"This medication olanzapine is AMAZING for marijuana withdrawals!  It helps so much with the loss of appetite, racing mind, agitation and insomnia, just not the night-sweating unfortunately but hey you cant have everything... I wouldn't recommend it unless you need it though, it commonly causes significant weight gain, expressionless face/personality, a little trouble getting out of bed in the morning and a slight, dopey/dumb feeling but all these side effects here wouldn't bother anyone getting off the weed.I have constantly been on/off the marijuana and every time I decide to put the bong down for a good while I go get on this medication. Seriously, I wish I knew about Olanzapine those first few times I got off the weed! Once it has been a few weeks the marijuana withdrawals are gone and I ditch this medication and feel fine again. In saying that, I've never taken this drug long term so I cant comment on its effects but short term? Especially Marijuana withdrawal? 10/10",Someone

This medicine makes you sleep SO good. It DOES cause weight gain. I have gained approx 20 lbs in 4 months but it’s worth it to be completely sane. My marriage is doing better, I’m calmer & I can 100% thank this medicine.",Missbritt
21,Olanzapine,Agitation,6,,"September 11, 2019",37,"Not sure what to think of this drug. It's really helped my wife's anxiety and panic episodes. And I completely understand how this is prescribed for insomnia. She sleeps all the time, loves napping, hard out-cold sleep. But she has gained a ton of weight. Obsessed with food all the time. Fantasizes about it and texts me about it. We go out to eat and on date nights all the time now. But she's gone from 115lbs to now well over 200. Everyone comments on how much more relaxed and happy she is. But her life is about kicking back, Netflix and being a total couch potato. She feels it's just what she needs. She gave away all of her old clothes and has no plan on losing. But I feel she's going to get much larger. I truthfully have no qualms with her being fat, it's simply the dramatic change came out of left field with this medication. Never envisioned being married to a 300lb woman. Be warned, it's no joke. She's on 15mg, btw.",Jack

I couldn't even walk outside to my car, I was afraid someone would see me. I can't make eye contact with people.

23,Olanzapine,Agitation,9,,"March 31, 2019",43,"Olanzapine has been really helpful for both justifiable and unjustifiable anger, irritation, anxiety. I've tried nearly every available drug for depression, anxiety, etc, but this one is the best in terms of benefit/side effects ratio.Helps moderately for insomnia, but best for when you are having  difficulty controlling your anger... just seems to stop you from boiling over. Also helps reduce the fruitless rumination that plagues us over-analyseres.",Charles

I feel myself for the first time in at least 5 years! I sent today a pack of research evidence-based articles to my neurologist to asked him to allow me to stay longer on Olanzapine.  I was meant to do just a 3 week trial.  But I feel so happy on it! A specific situation that would have got me very stressed in the past, was so  much easier! Its one the best meds I have tried it! I just hope it lasts!",Me
25,Olanzapine,Agitation,9,Taken for less than 1 month,"July 11, 2018",21,"Suffering from lifelong depression and,  in the last 18 months,  crippling anxiety as well. Tried many different depression meds and didn't like the side effects. Plus they can make anxiety worse in the initial stages.Had some left over xanax that I was given  by a psychiatrist  years ago. After using xanax for around 12 months I developed tolerance after a period. It worked at first but soon pooped out and anxiety was raging. No one should take benzodiazepines for more than 3 weeks. After one week on Olanzapine I was in a much much better place. Anxiety reduced from an 8 to a 3. Helps with depression too. Miracle drug. Hope its effects don't fade.",Dom

The worst 3 months of my life. Was put on zyprexa a few days later I’m about 80% anxiety free. My panic attack’s are gone. And the horrible muscle tension in my jaw, eye, neck, and nose is about 70% gone. I’ve learned from experience that not all drugs work for certain people.

He has high functioning autism. He had been placed on Respiradol with few improvements.  Zypreza has been a game changer for my son Jake.  He takes 5mg about an hour before bed. He is sleeping through the night (in 9 years he has never slept through the night).  He is happy and content. No more violent out bursts. He is eating non stop (he would barely eat prior to medication).  Very happy with the results that Jake is seeing on this medication and he has had no side effects outside of being hungry and eating more.",Jakes mom

30,Olanzapine,Agitation,9,Taken for less than 1 month,"July 12, 2015",48,Terrible side effects from Ssri and ssnri. Lexapro and celexa kept me in bed for a week before stopping. Others made my crawl out of my skin. I take 2.5 mg at bed and wake up with a great energy level! I have terrible anxiety all day long and this has made it go away! Love love love that I feel back to my old self. I had my first panic attack while driving and so although I force myself to do it I hated how exhausting it was. Only a week on this new Med has been a game changer. I started getting anxiety and panic attacks years ago for no good reason. I love life and was not stressed about anything. Anxiety turned my life upside down. Only a week on this I will update in a month.,Rsre
31,Olanzapine,Agitation,9,Taken for less than 1 month,"February 8, 2015",43,After using Paxil and clonidine and experiencing insomnia and lack of appetite my Dr prescribed zyprexa. After reading the reviews I did not take it for months and just kept it in my bathroom. When nothing else would control my anxiety I finally broke down and took it. Within twenty minutes I felt so much better. My obsessive and racing thoughts stopped and I could actually sleep and eat. I take 5mg at night. It does not make me sleep all day. Day two I noticed cravings for carbs but I find drinking a full glass of water takes care of that. You won't gain weight unless you don't control your eating which you absolutely can do. Don't give up and don't keep suffering. olanzapine can help you but maybe start with a low dose and see how you feel.,amandapanda1707
