1,Ketorolac ophthalmic,Seasonal Allergic Conjunctivitis,10,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"April 29, 2016",8,"Was prescribed these drops along w/2 others for my ""after cataract surgery"" eye care.  The surgery went off w/out a hitch, but I was still allergic to where I'd moved to.  A pharmacist mentioned this would help w/my extremely/unbelievably itchy ""allergy"" eyes.  A god-send that WORKS...no OTC eye drops made any difference at all.  Keep in refrigerator/it feels better.  Yes, it burns like wholly hell for a bit, but then the itching stops.  Now got to get my eye doctor to give me another prescription...",CA surfer
