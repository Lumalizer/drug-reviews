0,Zoledronic acid,Osteolytic Bone Lesions of Multiple Myeloma,2,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"July 17, 2021",0,"Zometa (zoledronic acid):I was placed on Zometa by my oncologist as a preventative medication to avoid bone lesions and fractures. I was  diagnosed with Multiple Myeloma earlier in the year. I fortunately do not have bone issues at this point, however my doctor thought it might help with prevention. After my first infusion, I developed severe chills, fever and terrible calf pain 24 hours later. The fever, chills and pain fortunately disappeared about a day or two later,...but the fatigue lasted for days. Before my 2nd monthly infusion-I drank more water. This did seem to help with avoiding chills and fever, but 24 hours later I again developed bad calf pain and realized I had edema in my legs. A day later it is better but again, I have horrible fatigue and bloating. The side effects to this medicine are worse than those of my cancer meds. I will have to talk to my doctor as I am not willing to do this every month - unless I really have to.",Sedona
1,Zoledronic acid,Osteolytic Bone Lesions of Multiple Myeloma,10,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"March 7, 2021",2,Zometa (zoledronic acid):I found being on this for a few years increased my bone density from   MINUS 4.2  down to  3.9 would recommend it,nikki
2,Zoledronic acid,Osteolytic Bone Lesions of Multiple Myeloma,9,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"October 7, 2019",3," I am currently having infusions once a month? The first month was Sept 19 and it took 7 days before it sunk in. Then I was feeling it through out my body with pain in the larger joints. Any sports injuries I had had show up also as pain. Just had second infusion 4 days ago have some of those same pains in joints starting today. I do get a balance issue at times usually focusing from computer screen? I'm also on Xtandi, and Trelstar, each has the same side affects plus a new one of there own! I have had minor anxiety attacks and some confusion but quickly go away with the water? I'm always feeling like I've done something wrong? If you stay busy these go away also.",Tank135
3,Zoledronic acid,Osteolytic Bone Lesions of Multiple Myeloma,2,,"March 30, 2018",33,"Zometa (zoledronic acid):I started Zometa IV once a month for 6 yrs. After having 2 stem cell transplants. Dìagnosed with Multiple Myeloma 12 yrs ago. During the last 2 years of Zometa I developed Osteonecrosis in my jaw, BRONJ after having a tooth extracted. That led to a domino effect causing all my lower teeth needing to be removed. I was a 48 yrs old woman when 1st diagnosed with MM. Stage 4. I was very physically active  and had teeth. I opted to stop taking Zometa as soon as the 1st tooth extracted showed difficulty in healing. I am now almost 60 yrs old and have been off Zometa for 4 yrs and have had no bone fractures or breaks. I had the achy bones, the cruddy feeling for a few days. Be fanatical about oral hygiene.",Sunny
4,Zoledronic acid,Osteolytic Bone Lesions of Multiple Myeloma,8,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"January 8, 2017",25,"Zometa (zoledronic acid):I started on Zometa about 3 years ago, at first it was every three months but over the past year I have it every 4 weeks. The side effects vary almost every time, sometimes it's aching bones or muscle pain and I usually feel weary to the point that I stay in bed all day, the effects usually hit me on the second day after having the infusion and only last for one day. Today is Sunday and I had the infusion on Friday so as I write this I'm feeling pretty rotten, but come tomorrow I'll be feeling much better so it doesn't worry me at all...and it's a lot better than having my bones snapping just because I've lifted something that's too heavy.",Steve.
5,Zoledronic acid,Osteolytic Bone Lesions of Multiple Myeloma,1,Taken for less than 1 month,"September 13, 2016",23,"Zometa (zoledronic acid):This new 20 min IV just about killed me and put me in the hospital for 7 days, then rehab for 2 weeks. I had the chronic upper thigh pain which made my right leg and foot numb and I need a walker to walk now. My calves also are very painful. This IV stopped my urination and I had to go to the ER.My urthea tube was completely closed and urologist got 3 1/2 liters off my bladder. I have to now have a cathier for the rest of my life. My kidneys did turn around but were very bad in the hospital. I have stage 4 prostate cancer and was on adreia and lupron shot every 3 months.The adreia IV was 2 hrs.I handled These meds very well but my new oncologists decided to change to zometa.I was not told about all of these side effects.",Jimbo52××××
6,Zoledronic acid,Osteolytic Bone Lesions of Multiple Myeloma,5,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"March 29, 2016",21,Zometa (zoledronic acid):My mother was on this IV treatment for about 3yrs  when she was first diagnosed with Multiple Myeloma. The only side effect at the time was nausea. 3yrs later she is now experiencing Osteonecrosis of the jaw due to this treatment. I guess my view on it is the treatment is it helped at the time to prevent any more lesions but now the bone in her jaw is dying and causing lots of pain. She just had surgery on her jaw to remove the dead bone and hopefully heal.,Anonymous
7,Zoledronic acid,Osteolytic Bone Lesions of Multiple Myeloma,10,,"May 9, 2012",46,"Zometa (zoledronic acid):I've been getting the infusions for almost 2 years now. The side effects are at a manageable level (compared to what I'm used to with other medicines I've been on for multiple myeloma). It is unknown how much longer I will be getting the infusions, as it varies from patient to patient. I would consider my quality of life as good as it gets, with only a temporary interruption every 3 months.",zople
