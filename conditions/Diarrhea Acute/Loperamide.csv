0,Loperamide,Diarrhea Acute,10,Taken for less than 1 month,"October 23, 2021",1,"Imodium (loperamide):I presumable caught the stomach bug going around my workplace, and had severe diarrhoea all day with stomach cramps, which started as soon as I woke up one morning. About 5.30pm I took an imodium, after a rough day and it stopped the diarrhoea completely. I was very pleased and shocked at how well it worked after just 2 tablets. Hopefully it wouldn't have lasted much longer anyway! Haha!",Millie

2,Loperamide,Diarrhea Acute,1,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"February 23, 2020",9,"Imodium (loperamide):I get diarrhoea because of anxiety , usually when I go out.   I always have to know where WCs are.   So I only go out about once a week.   Immodium has never made any difference.   I still try it about once every few weeks, but it never works!",Daffodil
3,Loperamide,Diarrhea Acute,8,Taken for 5 to 10 years,"July 11, 2019",21,"Imodium (loperamide):After 5 years of stomach cramps and less than 1 minute  of warning, I finally gave up on my PCP and started doing my own dietary analyzations. My daughter worked at a fantastic bakery, she would bring home the ""day old"" breads and bagels that didn't sell. Long story short; I overdosed on the best of the best at every meal and snack time. The culprit was GLUTEN, some days I was fine then all of a sudden 2 weeks worth of cramps and runs. Then I gave up on bread, pizza and pasta, which is a terrible thing for an Italian raised on the best foods. Breaded anything I now try to avoid, chicken, fish, fast foods.  When the runs and cramps go away for weeks, I can risk a slice of pizza IF I take a Gluten enzyme pill 20 minutes before I eat. Sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn't then out comes the Imodium, 3 before bed and 2 in the AM. In a day or so it's calmed down my IBS from whatever it caused it..",BINGO43
4,Loperamide,Diarrhea Acute,10,Taken for 10 years or more,"May 7, 2019",6,"Nurses love this stuff. You have a miserable patient with liquid stool and the doctor prescribes Imodium because it is OK according to the cause of the diarrhea. And with the first first 4 mg dose then 2 mg with every subsequent diarrhea stool the patient is relieved. Personally, I have direct experience with it myself. It really works, slows gastric motility down enough for your body to absorb the liquid it needs instead of pooping it out.",Nurse Bishop

I had acute diarrhea and my stools were looking like there was blood in it. Very scary. Followed directions 100% and after 2 doses was so much better. Even got to sleep some.

11,Loperamide,Diarrhea Acute,10,Taken for 10 years or more,"October 13, 2013",43,"Imodium (loperamide):If I eat meat, spicy foods, or dairy products, especially if it is later in the day, I sometimes get acute diarrhea at night.  This is sometimes accompanied by pain that is bad enough to double me over.  Imodium has always stopped the diarrhea, and the pain that I get with it, and almost always within two doses.  As the bottle suggests, I take two pills after the first loose stool, and one after any subsequent loose stool.  Although other medicines (such as Pepto-Bismal / Kaopectate) can also be helpful, whenever I sense that these symptoms are starting, I think of Imodium right away, because I know there is a very high probability that it will make the period of discomfort be as short as possible.",Shield Sheafson
