0,Imodium,Diarrhea Acute,10,Taken for less than 1 month,"October 23, 2021",1,"I presumable caught the stomach bug going around my workplace, and had severe diarrhoea all day with stomach cramps, which started as soon as I woke up one morning. About 5.30pm I took an imodium, after a rough day and it stopped the diarrhoea completely. I was very pleased and shocked at how well it worked after just 2 tablets. Hopefully it wouldn't have lasted much longer anyway! Haha!",Millie
1,Imodium,Diarrhea Acute,1,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"February 23, 2020",9,"I get diarrhoea because of anxiety , usually when I go out.   I always have to know where WCs are.   So I only go out about once a week.   Immodium has never made any difference.   I still try it about once every few weeks, but it never works!",Daffodil
2,Imodium,Diarrhea Acute,8,Taken for 5 to 10 years,"July 11, 2019",21,"After 5 years of stomach cramps and less than 1 minute  of warning, I finally gave up on my PCP and started doing my own dietary analyzations. My daughter worked at a fantastic bakery, she would bring home the ""day old"" breads and bagels that didn't sell. Long story short; I overdosed on the best of the best at every meal and snack time. The culprit was GLUTEN, some days I was fine then all of a sudden 2 weeks worth of cramps and runs. Then I gave up on bread, pizza and pasta, which is a terrible thing for an Italian raised on the best foods. Breaded anything I now try to avoid, chicken, fish, fast foods.  When the runs and cramps go away for weeks, I can risk a slice of pizza IF I take a Gluten enzyme pill 20 minutes before I eat. Sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn't then out comes the Imodium, 3 before bed and 2 in the AM. In a day or so it's calmed down my IBS from whatever it caused it..",BINGO43
3,Imodium,Diarrhea Acute,10,Taken for less than 1 month,"April 5, 2017",35,"Acute diarrhea .Was told by the pharmacist I could safely take Immodium while on (blood thinner) Eliquis. I had acute diarrhea and my stools were looking like there was blood in it. Very scary. Followed directions 100% and after 2 doses was so much better. Even got to sleep some. Felt like a miracle in an OTC product. Thank you so much. Symptoms   disappeared  after 2 doses. No bloody stools no pain.100% betterComplaint : opening packaging lost three pills somewhere in the carpet. Fourth pill I accidently broke open while in my mouth. Immediately began vomiting. Until there was no more fluid left. GREAT PRODUCT EFFECTIVE ALMOST IMMEDIATELY.  No consequences regarding blood thinners. Again,thank you.",poobelly

5,Imodium,Diarrhea Acute,10,Taken for 10 years or more,"October 13, 2013",43,"If I eat meat, spicy foods, or dairy products, especially if it is later in the day, I sometimes get acute diarrhea at night.  This is sometimes accompanied by pain that is bad enough to double me over.  Imodium has always stopped the diarrhea, and the pain that I get with it, and almost always within two doses.  As the bottle suggests, I take two pills after the first loose stool, and one after any subsequent loose stool.  Although other medicines (such as Pepto-Bismal / Kaopectate) can also be helpful, whenever I sense that these symptoms are starting, I think of Imodium right away, because I know there is a very high probability that it will make the period of discomfort be as short as possible.",Shield Sheafson
