0,Zydelig,Follicular Lymphoma,1,,"December 25, 2018",3,"After 6-1/2 years (2/2011-9/2017) on Rituxan-based therapy, I became refractory to it. I took 6 months off from all treatment, then started on Zydelig (3/2018). After 2-1/2 months, I experienced increasingly painful stomach and intestinal cramps, then diarrhea which landed me in the local V.A. hospital (6/30/2018-7/15/2018) with 'ballistic diarrhea' and experienced several Atrial Fibrillation events. A month after discharge, I was diagnosed (8/2018) with Type 2 diabetes. In November 2018, I was diagnosed with Myelodysplastic Syndrome after a bone marrow biopsy, and am now monitored with monthly blood-draws and physical exams. [My follicular lymphoma is presumptive evidence of Agent Orange exposure in 1968 in the Mekong Delta, and that is why I pay -0- for my treatments, Rxs and medications.]",Peedee Wyre
