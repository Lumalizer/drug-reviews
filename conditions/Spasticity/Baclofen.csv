0,Baclofen,Spasticity,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"October 11, 2021",1,"I have Cerebral Palsy. I've been taking it as prescribed. Started with half tablet, now I'm on 1 tablet 3 time/day. The only thing I noticed is that I get sleepy driving home (60miles).  Other than that, my spasms are the same",Jerry
1,Baclofen,Spasticity,3.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"December 28, 2020",2,"I had Transverse Myelitis in 1998.  I have had mild spasticity for the last few years that has gotten much worse.  I have 24/7 leg pain and I was prescribed Baclofen at 10mg once or twice a day.  This was a year ago.  I had to stop because I had severe depression.  Well, I thought I would try taking this medication again only before going to sleep at night.  I have to stop again because my wife is telling me she doesn't like how my personality has changed.  I don't know what to do now.  I need a medication that doesn't mess with my whole central nervous system and I don't think there's one out there.",Scurfie
2,Baclofen,Spasticity,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"April 25, 2019",5,"I've been taking this for the pain in my right calf for 17 days now, 5mg 3 times daily and honestly I don't feel any difference. Either my dosage is low or I'm taking a placebo either way I need to go back to Dr to be reassessed",Van
3,Baclofen,Spasticity,8.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"August 24, 2018",18,"Hi everyone, I take baclofen due to a brain stem tumour outcome, it left me with right sided hemiplegia so I’m full of spasticity down that side! Ouch! I find baclofen to be a great relief from spasams, not addictive, and pretty easy to take. If I forget I’ll know it, the cramps start. It does make you a little tired, but I’ve been on it for 3 years so I’m used to that. I feel like long term use, like I will be doing, could probably benifit from a baclofen pump (under the skin). But for now the pills are ok. I guess the only problem I have with it is that it’s short lived, wish there was a slow release pill.I’m in Australia and on disability, hence why meds cost $5.40 per month",LucindaGee
4,Baclofen,Spasticity,7.0,,"January 23, 2018",24,"I have Relapsing Remitting Multiple Sclerosis  (RR MS). More than 10 yrs in. I take Baclofen 60-100 mgs/day to reduce involuntary ""shaking"" caused by neurological deterioration. I am SHOCKED doctors are prescribing Baclofen to some of these users like Garden bug, for a miner ACL tear and another person for fibromyalgia. 10 mg/day is like taking a single baby aspirin and your pain is psychosomatic. Baclofen is used to control CNS chronic incurable disease, IT IS NOT a PAIN medication. It DOES NOT reduce pain. It controls the nerves at the SOURCE; spinal cord and neurologically. It reduces severe muscle spasms only. If you have late RR MS or PR MS, it can be effective to continue mobility to a certain point.",JacPoi
5,Baclofen,Spasticity,9.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"January 4, 2018",16,"Almost five years ago I was diagnosed with hereditary spastic paraplegia of unknown origin. My neurologist has proscribed 3×5 mg and to gradually rise it to maximum oral intake dosage of 3×25 mg. Through the adaptation period I was slowly rising my intake, with up to 10 days between next rise. I have found that 3×15 mg relieves me from spasms without compromising balance and muscle strength and leaves me option to increase dosage if needed. In the beginning you may have some side effects like dizziness, muscle weakness but they'll disappear. We all have different tolerance to the drugs so prescribed dosage is just for orientation. This is not a painkiller, and for that purpose you have to find different drug.",H_M
6,Baclofen,Spasticity,8.0,Taken for 5 to 10 years,"January 4, 2018",15,"I found Baclofen to be very helpful for my spasms and general muscle tightness. Unfortunately, my condition is chronic and long term use of the Baclofen rendered it ineffective as I built a tolerance to it. And sadly I have not found another muscle relaxer that works well for me. Some I tried gave me horrible side effects...nausea, insomnia, loss of appetite, etc., etc. So after a short break I'm back to taking a smaller dose of Baclofen. It's not as effective as it initially was but I have no side effects!",Brettster
7,Baclofen,Spasticity,,,"August 21, 2016",11,"I experienced severe breathing difficulties. If I hadn't had some salbutamol handy, I would most likely have  gone into unconciousness. I have experienced fluid on the lung before & had to be taken to hospital by ambulance. Luckily I did have someone with me at the time who was able to call the ambulance when I passed out. I didn't regain conciousness until 5 hours later, waking in the emergency department of a hospital. Something I would not like to happen again.",Einir
