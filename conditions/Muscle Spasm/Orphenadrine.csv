3,Orphenadrine,Muscle Spasm,8.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"June 17, 2021",2,"I've been on a host of antidepressants and opiates. While opiates do relieve my pain slightly more this is a miracle drug for those who do not want to be on a lifetime of daily medication. The analgesic effect of this drug seems to go hand in hand with nerve pain, although it does not directly help the pain, I find it releases tension in my back which in turn helps the pain substantially. My only beef with this substance is that it only lasts 4-5 hours where as Panadeine or something similar lasts 8-10 hours. Please be aware of anticholinergic effects, it can give weird dreams and hallucinations if not enough choline is present. its 1/3rd as strong as PCP as an NDMA agonist.",keatmined

I only use it when absolutely necessary along with Tramadol or Diclofenac - the only meds I use for pain.  No dizziness nor nausea or creepy side effects.
