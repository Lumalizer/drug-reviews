1,Flexeril,Muscle Spasm,1.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"December 15, 2021",0,Prescribed it countless times over the years and not once has it ever helped or had any impact. NOT ONCE. It's to the point that I don't even get it filled when I'm prescribed it anymore. Absolute waste of money. Becoming increasingly convinced that it's just prescribed to pad insurance billing. Tylenol and ibuprofen have more of an impact than this garbage.,HybridFreak
2,Flexeril,Muscle Spasm,5.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"November 17, 2021",1,"I was prescribed Flexeril 10mg after a car accident & injuries. The 1st time I took it as prescribed, said 3 x a day & my 1st dose was on my way to class at 5pm. I parked, took my flexeril, went to class and within an hour I had to leave. I felt so dizzy and nauseous, I don't know how I drove home but thank the Lord I made it. I then took it only at night, which doesn't help when your pain is ALL DAY  but Dr's refuse to put you on anything that actually helps with pain like a narcotic that you only take AS NEEDED and not 3x a day or whatever the directions are. I have gone to pain management a few times throughout the last 5 years since my accident. I have been given every muscle relaxer they make and flexeril & carsiprodol are the only two that help but they don't recommend taking for longer than 2 weeks. What  option does that leave daily pain patients? I didn't get the mood swings with flexeril like I did amitriptyline or cymbalta. I'm on the fence with Flexeril.",Mariah

The cause of my pain is lower back degeneration, I was in more pain on those drugs than without however the nerve damage in my lower legs was bad and the detox made it evident that it wasn't going to get better.   I take 2 - 4mg most nights but others I take only one depending on the day.  It helps to make my legs/feet rest and myself as well.  I wake most mornings with the ability to stand and not cry.  I can't take it very early as it will wear off and I will be awake by 3am and that is way too early for work.",LessMore

6,Flexeril,Muscle Spasm,10.0,,"May 3, 2021",23,"I was diagnosed with with spondylolisthesis  (L3-4 & L 4-5) 30 years ago in my 20's. Pain was so bad I would not be able to stand and I would drop to the floor. I had frequent pain with 5-6 extreme episodes of my back severely ""going out"" for days in the next 20 years, and was eventually given Flexeril. A physical therapist taught me to stretch my hamstrings and glutes when tight, as they are connected to and pull on my lower back muscles, which in turn pulls and pinches nerves in my L-vertebrae. I can usually avoid my back ""going out"" by stretching + OTC pain relief, but I take 1 Flexeril at night for a day or 2 if really bad and it relaxes my muscles enough to un pinch the nerves and relieve the severe pain. Because of my condition, I still have low back pain after vacuuming, gardening, hiking long distance, etc., but my back hasn't ""gone out"" in 10 years. I DO wake up groggy in the morning after taking Flexeril, so if I have to go to work the next day, I may only take half a pill.",Managing It

8,Flexeril,Muscle Spasm,7.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"November 1, 2020",11,"I was apprehensive about taking this after reading the reviews but my experience has been positive. I had jaw surgery 6.5 weeks ago and at about 5 weeks my left condyle slipped off the disc and stayed there (Slipped TMJ disc). I couldn't open my mouth anymore without sharp pain. Swallowing hurt, talking hurt, sometimes even moving my head hurt. It was like this for 6 days before I was able to see my surgeon and get a prescription. The next day after I started Flexeril , the pain improved. The day after, I could chew a little. Today is day four and I'm amazed at how much better my joint feels, I can open comfortably and I'm not in constant pain anymore. The side effects for me have been minimal. Maybe a little more tired, but honestly I hardly notice. My mouth is a bit dry too.The great irony, however, is that I still get jaw spasms. On that count it's been completely ineffective. But they don't bother me too much, I only get a few per day and if I open too wide.",Meg

11,Flexeril,Muscle Spasm,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"February 26, 2020",174,"I took this briefly for pelvic pain and muscle spasm. I would never wish to scare anyone with side effect horror stories, but I strongly urge anyone taking this drug to pay attention to how they feel emotionally while on it. After just a few days of taking this drug, I felt highly irritable and was in the darkest of places in my mind. I was taking Tramadol at the same time so I thought maybe it was a combination of the two. I stopped the tramadol for several days and just took the flexeril, but I still felt unmotivated, depressed, and angry. I decided it was not worth it even if it offered physical relief. My advice is always do your research before starting a new medication. Many doctors don’t discuss these side effects with patients and depending on what you’re taking, you may unwittingly be on a dangerous combination of drugs that can affect you not just physically, but emotionally as well.",K

13,Flexeril,Muscle Spasm,5.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"January 31, 2020",51,I am so glad I found this article of comments online about Flexeril. I was wondering if the pain from the back muscle spasms was causing me to be so agitated and short tempered until I read another comment about a woman whose mood became very nasty and mean tempered when she was on Flexeril.  I’m usually very easy-going but have been an intense pain since Monday when I’ve bent over and pulled a muscle. I’ve had this occur several years ago and was able at that time to go to my primary doctor and get a shot for inflammation and some info on exercises. These helped tremendously and  eventually  I got back to normal. However  this time My doctor was out of town and I couldn’t get anyone to get me in for an appointment so I called for a refill on my Flexeril and every since I’ve been taking it three days I have noticed I am so agitated and quick tempered with my pets I have in my home  ?   after reading all this I will probably wean myself off...,Gigi

After two or three days like that, I began taking the medicine at about 7 pm so that I could be awake to notice if the medication worked or not.  At 11 pm, I still felt nothing.  I didn't feel any relief from my muscles nor was I the least bit drowsy. I told my doctor my concerns about it not working and her response was ""It works longterm.

I also think it made me stop breathing for a few seconds at a time. I was lying there trying to sleep (because this stuff knocked me for a loop), but I couldn't because I kept feeling like I couldn't breathe. But I was too out of it to understand why. I only knew that my breath would stop for a few seconds and then I'd come fully awake gasping for breath.

24,Flexeril,Muscle Spasm,7.0,,"June 27, 2019",22,"This medication is great short term or for a one off just to release muscle tension, but make sure you don't take it with any other medications for pain like opioids, anti-depressant/anxiety, even natural medications, OR hayfever meds. If you take something else, make sure it's out of your system before taking Flexeril with it or other meds with Flexeril. I never really felt drowsy or depressed with flexeril alone, but I started on a very healthy diet + herbal medication for ovulation and there was a huge difference. The leaflet says there is no interaction with Melatonin but that is in my ovulation meds and I do believe it makes you more drowsy. That it its interacting with my cleaner system. Now I'll only take this as a one off but not with other meds or herbals. My neck/shoulder pain is stress related which also links in with diet, so I'm going to work on that first and use Flexeril as a last resort.

So, I tried to avoid taking the meds this morning for a couple of hours. Now, it is mid day and the pain hasn't stopped so I took another one pill.

I was okay taking 10 mg once a day. It was when he increased my dosage was when I started to have very very serious side effects. Among the normal side effects sleepiness grogginess confusion that's a given but it was working so I tolerated it. When I  jumped to 20 mg a day within a week or two I started to develop much more serious side effects. I developed a rapid heart rate and one of the most serious was I could not urinate. I was put on a catheter on Easter Sunday for about 5 weeks. And just prior to that I was having difficulty swallowing. Along with that I started to have hallucinations big time. I ended up with such bad nightmares that I literally fell out of my bed three nights in a row. My urologist finally put the pieces together when he found out how long I had been on Flexeril.

I'll usually take it before bed if my back muscles are tense. It does what it is supposed to do and helps relax my muscles enough to go to sleep.
