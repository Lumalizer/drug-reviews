1,Cyclobenzaprine,Muscle Spasm,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"March 13, 2022",0,"Waste of time. These dumb doctors don't know what they're giving to people. It severely messes with you brain chemistry and makes you feel empty and borderline suicidal for real. They figure if you do this to your brian then your muscle spasms will subside. But the side effects ARE the main effect. Depression unlike you've ever had  lasting for a long long time. The effect that was intended was so eclipsed by the depression it wasn't even worth it. Not a safe alternative to traditional meds like valium and opiates which actually WORK. I wish they would stop treating us like children and give us the good stuff for Christ sake. Cyclo along with all these other antidepressants they hand out to deal with a variety of ailments are very irresponsible. Don't mess with them. And before you take them ask the doctor that prescribes them if they have ever tried Cyclo. Chances are not, those nerds just read some stupid studies that said they work for muscle relief which they do not even do that!",Levi

NOT ONCE. It's to the point that I don't even get it filled when I'm prescribed it anymore. Absolute waste of money.

4,Cyclobenzaprine,Muscle Spasm,5.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"November 17, 2021",1,"Flexeril (cyclobenzaprine):I was prescribed Flexeril 10mg after a car accident & injuries. The 1st time I took it as prescribed, said 3 x a day & my 1st dose was on my way to class at 5pm. I parked, took my flexeril, went to class and within an hour I had to leave. I felt so dizzy and nauseous, I don't know how I drove home but thank the Lord I made it. I then took it only at night, which doesn't help when your pain is ALL DAY  but Dr's refuse to put you on anything that actually helps with pain like a narcotic that you only take AS NEEDED and not 3x a day or whatever the directions are. I have gone to pain management a few times throughout the last 5 years since my accident. I have been given every muscle relaxer they make and flexeril & carsiprodol are the only two that help but they don't recommend taking for longer than 2 weeks. What  option does that leave daily pain patients? I didn't get the mood swings with flexeril like I did amitriptyline or cymbalta. I'm on the fence with Flexeril.",Mariah

I take 2 - 4mg most nights but others I take only one depending on the day.  It helps to make my legs/feet rest and myself as well.  I wake most mornings with the ability to stand and not cry.

Pain was so bad I would not be able to stand and I would drop to the floor. I had frequent pain with 5-6 extreme episodes of my back severely ""going out"" for days in the next 20 years, and was eventually given Flexeril. A physical therapist taught me to stretch my hamstrings and glutes when tight, as they are connected to and pull on my lower back muscles, which in turn pulls and pinches nerves in my L-vertebrae. I can usually avoid my back ""going out"" by stretching + OTC pain relief, but I take 1 Flexeril at night for a day or 2 if really bad and it relaxes my muscles enough to un pinch the nerves and relieve the severe pain. Because of my condition, I still have low back pain after vacuuming, gardening, hiking long distance, etc., but my back hasn't ""gone out"" in 10 years. I DO wake up groggy in the morning after taking Flexeril, so if I have to go to work the next day, I may only take half a pill.",Managing It

Swallowing hurt, talking hurt, sometimes even moving my head hurt. It was like this for 6 days before I was able to see my surgeon and get a prescription. The next day after I started Flexeril , the pain improved. The day after, I could chew a little. Today is day four and I'm amazed at how much better my joint feels, I can open comfortably and I'm not in constant pain anymore. The side effects for me have been minimal. Maybe a little more tired, but honestly I hardly notice. My mouth is a bit dry too.The great irony, however, is that I still get jaw spasms. On that count it's been completely ineffective.

I would never wish to scare anyone with side effect horror stories, but I strongly urge anyone taking this drug to pay attention to how they feel emotionally while on it. After just a few days of taking this drug, I felt highly irritable and was in the darkest of places in my mind. I was taking Tramadol at the same time so I thought maybe it was a combination of the two. I stopped the tramadol for several days and just took the flexeril, but I still felt unmotivated, depressed, and angry. I decided it was not worth it even if it offered physical relief. My advice is always do your research before starting a new medication. Many doctors don’t discuss these side effects with patients and depending on what you’re taking, you may unwittingly be on a dangerous combination of drugs that can affect you not just physically, but emotionally as well.",K

I’m usually very easy-going but have been an intense pain since Monday when I’ve bent over and pulled a muscle. I’ve had this occur several years ago and was able at that time to go to my primary doctor and get a shot for inflammation and some info on exercises. These helped tremendously and  eventually  I got back to normal.

Flex was great at relieving muscles spasms for 7 out of 10 days Rx-d. I took it for all 10 days, tho' the low-back spasms were gone after day 7--the kidney-stone-pain, however, remained.I've been taking it ""as needed"" (having fractured my T12 or L1 vertebra when I was 8, herniated discs, etc--at this writing, I'm 59) for about 6 months, per my PCP. After the first bottle, I told him about the soporific/zombie effects and he now requires me to take it only when I go to bed to sleep.Flex has a 1/2 life of 18-23 hours. Thus, it doesn't wear off fast. A bit of Melatonin helps me get better-than-zombie sleep. :)",JohnEEADBL
