12,Baclofen,Muscle Spasm,8.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"August 29, 2021",1,"Baclofen has made a real difference, both in pain levels and how I perceive it. I have had near-constant thoracic pain and radiculopathy for years, since being treated for spinal TB. I lost a disc before I was properly diagnosed and treated, in India. US doctors missed it for years so I'm lucky to be alive and walking. I now have bone spurs and relentless pain, along with degenerative disc disease. I've been taking Baclofen for only about 3 weeks but it made a difference at once. The pain is reduced, I sleep better and, while the burning and aching never entirely subside, I don't notice it nearly as much. It has also reduced my anxiety and my appetite. That may sound good, but I'm a person who doesn't eat when I'm in pain or otherwise distressed.",Anonymous

It made me slightly manic, like I'd had way too much coffee, but not enough to be dangerous. I had a doctor tell me not to make major life decisions on this drug, and I see why. The worst of it though it's the vivid, terrifying nightmares where I felt like I was in real danger and woke up screaming.

I have suffered from chronic pain for 20 years after a motorcycle accident that resulted in fractures of T1 2 in 3 of my transverse processes and displacement of 2 other vertebras including 13 other fractures including punctured lungs and separations in my shoulder and clavicle. I know everybody on this post has serious pain. I tried every narcotic pain medication even becoming chemically dependent and eventually addicted to many of them and 4 other muscle relaxers and every other treatment (PT, acupuncture surgeries etc.) that I'm sure everybody on this board has tried. I have serious scar tissue in my upper back lower neck which caused me constant and severe pain. I stumbled upon baclofen going to urgent care to get a toradol shot just to make it so I could sleep that night. After I woke up the next morning taking my 1st dose of baclofen I had 50%+ pain reduction! For those of you that suffer from true chronic pain that is life affecting every minute of your life you can understand why I'm in tears writing this post. I cannot believe I had never tried this medication. I'm sure it does not work the same for everybody but when it works it is a miracle drug! I now can sleep the whole night and when I wake up in the morning I am not dreading a day of pain. Let me be clear I had 20 years of debilitating pain every minute I was awake unless I sedated myself so much that I could finally fall asleep. I went to four detox centers and two rehabs Because of all the opiate pain medications I was taking and then became addicted to.  I have been suffering through taking naltrexone to keep me from using narcotic pain meds to escape from my pain. I have a whole new life at age 42 now. I pray that this medication works as well for anybody else reading or posting on this site. God bless all of you suffering.",Fowbr01
