0,Diazepam,Muscle Spasm,10.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"March 28, 2022",0,It has been used for my  esophageal spasms and it works extremely well but doctors will not prescribe it for me.,buckeye58cb
1,Diazepam,Muscle Spasm,8.0,,"March 14, 2022",0,"I am prescribed diazepam long term for chronic muscle spasms in my neck and shoulders. Without diazepam my muscles are completely rigid and any movement causes crepitis and loud cracking. Diazepam does not relieve the nerve pain of my condition, and people should be aware of this. It may take pressure off the nerves through reduced tension but will not treat nerve pain.I rate this medicine highly for what it does, its a muscle relaxant not a pain reliever and it does what it says. However, and this is the downpoint, tolerance develops very quickly on this medication. So much so that after just a few weeks the only relief in consumption is relieving withdrawal. This is why many people ask to be prescribed higher and higher doses of benzodiazapines. I refuse to take any more than 5mg a day. When I build up a tolerance I go cold turkey for 8 weeks and I'm prescribed an alternative  baclofen. I switch between the two medicines to prevent tolerance and increasing dosage.",LMarsh
2,Diazepam,Muscle Spasm,1.0,Taken for 10 years or more,"February 27, 2022",2,Valium (diazepam):It has been a terrible drug for me. I was put on 5 mg for pelvic muscle spasms for 4 years. I became chronically nauseated for 6 months had my gallbladder removed and nausea ceased. During that time doctor increased Valium to 35 mg to combat nausea when other meds were ineffective. Doctor then  abruptly stopped Valium. I had convulsions was very sick and didn’t know why. Eventually a psychiatrist reinstated 15 mg. That was 12 years ago. Have never been the same. Didn’t realize how it can disrupt a body.  There are over 100 side effects you can experience tapering off this drug. It is a dirty drug that interacts with so many other medications. I am currently on a very slow liquid taper and praying I can recover. Most people eventually do recover. A small percentage suffer permanent damage.,Kathy

4,Diazepam,Muscle Spasm,9.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"December 19, 2021",0,"I have been dealing with headaches for years. Primarily on my right side. The pain originates in the bottom of my trapezius muscle in my mid back, and then travel up my back, out into the upper trapezius, the base of my skull, and then snake around my ear and jaw, and settle around my right eye. I’ve been working with a physical therapist for about 7 months now, and while it had been helpful, I will get these headaches. When they’re bad, I’ll spend the whole day in bed nauseous, sleeping, with a heat source. ibuprofen rarely helps the severe ones. Stretching, working on my posture, increasing thoracic spinal mobility, pectoral stretches, and lying on an acupressure mat have been the most effective. My doctor recently prescribed valium for me to try, for muscle relaxant for these headaches. Today is the second time I’m trying it, and find it incredibly helpful. 5mg when I feel the headache coming on, maybe once a month or so.",mmm

8,Diazepam,Muscle Spasm,9.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"June 16, 2021",30,I was on Diazepam for a couple of months then my doctor was switched and was taken off because it was a benzo! I have bipolar disorder osteoarthritis and possible autoimmune disorder. The pain that I started to suffer in my upper thighs at night was unbearable. Then I started to get terrible muscle spasms in my feet and calf muscles so bad that one night my husband had to call the ambulance and I was rushed to to hospital. Finally got a new specialist and he immediately put me back on Diazepam explaining that it helps with anxiety thus helps to relax muscles. I am now on 15mg working my way up to 20mg and for the first time in months have not had a muscle spasm and  have been able to start to sleep. I am a 52 year old woman and have my own business thought I was going to have to stop working. This drug is given a bad reputation but used properly is a life saver!!,SJC123

For the past 6 years I can honestly say there is nothing I haven’t tried..root blocks, trigger point injections, Botox, physio, acupuncture, possibly every home remedy going and all the nasty meds eg. Gabapentin, Amitriptyline etc and nothing has worked except Diazepam! I honestly don’t know what I’d do without it, I only have the 2mg tablets and use them for emergency’s only as doc really reluctant to prescribe regularly and seems like I’m not the only one having this prob after reading other reviews here. So when my pain is at it’s max, when I can’t literally move as my back is in so much spasm that’s when I take it, rest of the time I just have to put up with the pain daily.",Rache

The diazepam was 10mg 2x a day. I had never taken it before. It helped a bit, but mostly made me feel like a zombie. I also didn’t feel like I had restful sleep - more like forced sleep that I didn’t feel well rested from. After taking 10mg 2x I stopped. The prednisone seems to be helping more by reducing inflammation.",Cathy

13,Diazepam,Muscle Spasm,10.0,,"November 29, 2020",35,"Valium (diazepam):I had severe neck tightness 5 days ago and alleve did not help. I finally fell asleep but the next day I could not move my head more than an inch without severe shooting pain.  Even texting hurt - the nurse where I live prescribed Baclofen which did not help at all-still shooting pain, no movement. So I called a surgeon and he said Valium is the best for muscle spasms.  I asked the nurse practitioner to prescribe it but she would not, (no controlled substances"")  These strong drugs are for a reason!! I was in excruciating pain till  I got the valium and acetaminophen filled (from another county) the pain and tightness noticeably lessened by the end of the day. The next day, yesterday, I did not need the pain reliever, just the valium.  It is the BEST for muscle spasm and I only took half a dose today.  I will be saving them for when i have another serious ailment and doctors won't prescribe!!!",marie

17,Diazepam,Muscle Spasm,10.0,Taken for 5 to 10 years,"September 28, 2020",47,"I’ve taken Valium fairly regularly for about 8 years. First started out prescribed 10 mg daily as needed, always broke in 1/2 or even 1/4s. Then got a new script for 5 mg daily, still mostly break in half, take a whole a couple times a week if needed. It’s *the* med best hands down I’ve tried for chronic pain: migraines, degenerative spine arthritis, herniated disc (spine surgery), sciatica, muscle spasms in my neck and lower back. Also for bad chronic TMJ, I’ve made a paste in a small bit of water, rubbed it on my back gums.  Almost immediate relief.I’ve tried to be judicious about taking it. Even though it’s a benzo, and not an opiate, it can be very difficult to get off it. Because it’s so good. I also experienced little to no side effects. Sometimes woozy as with a Sudafed or similar. Nothing alarming. Anyways, hope this is helpful. If your doctor will prescribe it, (sometimes they’re hesitant), get it. Try it out.",SJ
18,Diazepam,Muscle Spasm,10.0,Taken for 10 years or more,"September 7, 2020",81,"Diazepam is MUCH more effective for fibromyalgia pain. I also have 6 herniated discs, pinched/damaged nerves, and arthritis in my spine and all joints. In addition to that, I have severe, non-stop chronic tinnitus in my right ear, as well as RLS and RBD. Diazepam is the one drug that treats ALL of these conditions. 20mg at bedtime helps me sleep, and lasts all day. I hate how benzodiazepines have become demonized. They are some of the safest, most studied, most effective drugs on the market. Diazepam provides people with an extremely improved quality of life where they would otherwise be suffering. SSRIs and SNRIs come with risk of withdrawal syndrome equal to or worse than benzodiazepine withdrawal. The difference is, benzodiazepines actually work, whereas SSRIs and SNRIs are placebo. No other drug on the market can treat so many conditions so effectively.",Headcloud

It's a 5MG pill that I crush up, put in coconut oil, freeze it, and then insert it into my vagina.

22,Diazepam,Muscle Spasm,9.0,,"June 20, 2020",30,"Valium (diazepam):My doctor prescribed Valium after I had two lung surgeries. It was to treat the pain and muscle spasms. Thankful it was only 5 mgs per night. I couldn’t get a refill in time and I’d been on it for about two years, I just felt it was time to get off of the valium. I think I’m doing better pain wise. And I take Tramadol for that pain during the day. I have been experiencing withdrawals. I am taking natural supplements in place to wean me off. I shake a little. Rapid anxious thoughts. Digestive upset. Irritability. Panic. It’s not good to take it long term. I rated Valium high because it did its job. Relaxed me and the only side effects for me was dry mouth, more tired in the morning. The con is clearly the addictive properties of it. Your body starts to need it just to go to sleep or feel normal. I’m hoping this will end soon. I read it can take months or years to come off valium.

For an MRI examination they gave me midazelom as sedation. It was the first real relief in three months that lasted for a beautiful 2 hrs.

Valium is a wonder drug when not in the hands of abusers who get all the attention necessary to cause its false accusations as a problem drug.  It is a problem for some just as alcohol is a problem for many that cannot restrain from abuse.  It should be unlawful for employers to define what medications my doctor prescribes to me or anyone.  We have let the lawyers and the ignorant decide what allows us to survive in this chaos of repression we call a free society.
