I have always run straight to opiate pain meds (as no other muscle relaxants have ever worked for me) but I found 4 OLD  robaxacet I had stashed - I never tried these before but within 20 minutes I could stand up.Not sure about side effects..I'm hoping it makes me drowsy as I'm a month off of methadone and looking to sleep. But pain is gone..and SO FAST! Only took a 500 mg/200 mg ibuprofen,Cihlver
3,Methocarbamol,Muscle Spasm,9.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"October 29, 2021",0,"Robaxin (methocarbamol):Ended up in the hospital with severe back pain. I had a ruptured disc between L1 & S1. I could not sit, stand or walk. My spine has numerous bulging disc from old injuries & the vertebras are eaten up by multiple myeloma. After 2 doctors tried to force me up & out of bed after adding morphine shots and Dilaudid IV’s to my twice a day 15mg extended release morphine tabs with no relief. The 3rd doctor was great & didn’t force me to move. He put me on 6mg of Dexamethasone, 1000mg of Robaxin & 5mg of Valium. With in a matter of hours I could sit up, after a couple of doses I could stand & walk with a walker & after a day & a half I was walking on my own & was discharged from the hospital.

4,Methocarbamol,Muscle Spasm,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"October 24, 2021",0,"Robaxin (methocarbamol):I took Robaxin with 600mg Ibuprofen for pain. There's an aspect of muscle tension or contractures with Neurogenic Thoracic Outlet Syndrome (NTOS) so muscle relaxers been be used to try and manage pain. The idea behind the 600mg Ibuprofen and Robaxin was to have a muscle relaxer with an anti inflammatory working at the same time, I guess to get as close to an analgesic as possible. Day one I could hardly sleep at all and felt like my anti anxiety medication had been negated, very wired and anxious, feeling somewhat mentally off like on the verge of mania. After a week of taking this on the seventh day I felt very strange. I started feeling dizzy but not a spinning dizzy, more like a head rush type dizzy. I started getting hot and cold flashes and felt like my face was going white; I felt very faint. I started to feel every beat of my heart, it felt slow and hard. Then I started seeing little green spots and red tracers; ultimately I just felt sick. I felt like I was either going to have a heart attack or pass out, maybe both",Jinks

7,Methocarbamol,Muscle Spasm,8.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"September 17, 2021",1,"Robaxin (methocarbamol):I began taking this after suffering an extremely painful hamstring injury, which rendered me virtually unable to walk or even sit comfortably, and it put me out of work for a few miserable weeks. It doesn't stop the pain completely but it makes it much more manageable. I can take a couple of these and make it through the day. I recommend mixing it with ibuprofen, just be careful with the dosage. One 750 mg tablet and two 250 mg ibuprofen every 6 hours does the trick for me, but you should check with a doctor first. This isn't a magical pill that will fix you completely, but it definitely helps. The first day I took it, it had no noticeable effect on me, but the second day I felt much better, so it may take a few doses for your body to get used to it. It's no miracle pill but it definitely helps.",Jake

The relief allows me to participate at a competitive level of pool and relieves the pain of the condition better than other significant analgesics I am prescribed. I cannot say I have suffered any side effects that have had any impact on me going about my daily business or normal activities.

Gabapentin helps with the nerve pain, but Flexeril and Baclofen knocked me out rather than helping with the pain from muscle tension. A neurologist recommended methocarbamol to help relax the muscles and resultant headaches (he said to take a 750 mg pill whenever I needed it). Taking one pill here and there, or even regularly once a day didn't really seem to do anything at all, though it didn't make me sleepy or have any noticeable side effects (a first for any muscle relaxer I have ever taken). I talked with my regular doctor, and we agreed to try one pill twice daily, everyday. This has made a really positive difference in my quality of life. I can now sit at my computer for 2-3 hours uninterrupted without pain and have fewer headaches. I'm happy to consider this a maintenance med and stay on it for as long as it continues to work.",Beth

Anyway, this is the second time I have been prescribed Robaxin for that pain.  The first time I didn't think it helped but after taking it again, I know it doesn't help with my pain at all. It did make me sleepy but there's nothing worse than being so drowsy but not being able to fall asleep because the pain is so bad. On top of that my prescription is for 120 tablets. Just seems to be the automatic prescription my Dr. gives for this.  I would much rather have a week supply of something that will take care of the pain so I can sleep.",Marly

It seems to take a long time to kick in --30-45 minutes or so, but then it's great. No high, slight drowsiness, much less pain.

It works great when the attacks occur in the night. I even get attacks while wearing a night guard. Attacks usually are rare unless there is extreme stress on any given day. I only take a pill when I get an attack which is about 4 to 5 a month. The drug takes about ten minutes to kick in, which is much better than the 30+ minutes it takes for the attack to subside without the drug. The pain associated with a TMJ attack is utterly excruciating. Imagine how painful a charlie horse is in your calf or foot, then imagine it could take 30+ minutes for the pain to go away.
