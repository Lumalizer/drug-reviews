0,Valium,Muscle Spasm,1.0,Taken for 10 years or more,"February 27, 2022",2,It has been a terrible drug for me. I was put on 5 mg for pelvic muscle spasms for 4 years. I became chronically nauseated for 6 months had my gallbladder removed and nausea ceased. During that time doctor increased Valium to 35 mg to combat nausea when other meds were ineffective. Doctor then  abruptly stopped Valium. I had convulsions was very sick and didn’t know why. Eventually a psychiatrist reinstated 15 mg. That was 12 years ago. Have never been the same. Didn’t realize how it can disrupt a body.  There are over 100 side effects you can experience tapering off this drug. It is a dirty drug that interacts with so many other medications. I am currently on a very slow liquid taper and praying I can recover. Most people eventually do recover. A small percentage suffer permanent damage.,Kathy
1,Valium,Muscle Spasm,10.0,,"July 16, 2021",2,I have a chronic muscle spasm in my right shoulder area after a surgery followed by a car accident years later. Valium is the only medication that I find relieves the pain. I don’t find endone or that family helpful at all.,JC

3,Valium,Muscle Spasm,10.0,,"November 29, 2020",35,"I had severe neck tightness 5 days ago and alleve did not help. I finally fell asleep but the next day I could not move my head more than an inch without severe shooting pain.  Even texting hurt - the nurse where I live prescribed Baclofen which did not help at all-still shooting pain, no movement. So I called a surgeon and he said Valium is the best for muscle spasms.  I asked the nurse practitioner to prescribe it but she would not, (no controlled substances"")  These strong drugs are for a reason!! I was in excruciating pain till  I got the valium and acetaminophen filled (from another county) the pain and tightness noticeably lessened by the end of the day. The next day, yesterday, I did not need the pain reliever, just the valium.  It is the BEST for muscle spasm and I only took half a dose today.  I will be saving them for when i have another serious ailment and doctors won't prescribe!!!",marie
4,Valium,Muscle Spasm,10.0,Taken for 10 years or more,"September 2, 2020",23,"I do not tolerate opiates so discovering Valium as a pain reliever for severe muscle spasms is great.

5,Valium,Muscle Spasm,9.0,,"June 20, 2020",30,"My doctor prescribed Valium after I had two lung surgeries. It was to treat the pain and muscle spasms. Thankful it was only 5 mgs per night. I couldn’t get a refill in time and I’d been on it for about two years, I just felt it was time to get off of the valium. I think I’m doing better pain wise. And I take Tramadol for that pain during the day. I have been experiencing withdrawals. I am taking natural supplements in place to wean me off. I shake a little. Rapid anxious thoughts. Digestive upset. Irritability. Panic. It’s not good to take it long term. I rated Valium high because it did its job. Relaxed me and the only side effects for me was dry mouth, more tired in the morning. The con is clearly the addictive properties of it. Your body starts to need it just to go to sleep or feel normal. I’m hoping this will end soon. I read it can take months or years to come off valium. I was on a low dose so I hope it won’t last that long.",Jeanie

7,Valium,Muscle Spasm,10.0,Taken for 10 years or more,"November 13, 2019",253,Been using Valium for over 25 years for sciatica and anxiety.  Saved me from potential hospital visits for both my conditions.  I use 10 mg about 3 to 4 times a week.  I have stopped when conditions were better for up to a month without any withdrawal problems.  Valium is a wonder drug when not in the hands of abusers who get all the attention necessary to cause its false accusations as a problem drug.  It is a problem for some just as alcohol is a problem for many that cannot restrain from abuse.  It should be unlawful for employers to define what medications my doctor prescribes to me or anyone.  We have let the lawyers and the ignorant decide what allows us to survive in this chaos of repression we call a free society.  Robot doctors are overriding the decisions prescribed by my doctor of over 40 years.  Hippocratic oaths are now broken in the name of government infringement on our rights.  ,Lennyg

13,Valium,Muscle Spasm,9.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"November 26, 2018",70,"Last week I went to the emergency room with my neck completely frozen and a  blinding headache. After 72 hours of trying heating pads & everything from Advil to Flexeril to Vicodin with NO effect, I was convinced it had to be meningitis. My BP (normally a chill 120/70) was 145/92, so when the doc said 'I'm not trying to minimize what you're going thru,  but you've just got a stiff neck; I'm giving you valium',  I was furious. Well,  my apologies to the ER doc, because so far it has worked like a charm--only 4 days and I've got 80% of my mobility back, and the remaining pain is manageable with Advil. I always thought Valium was only an anti-anxiety drug, but I'm happy to have been mistaken.  I'd highly recommend this as short-term treatment for muscle spasm; Flexeril had always been my go-to, but if for some reason it's ineffective on your spinal pain, Valium is great. However,  I can't WAIT to get off it: I feel it's really impaired my mental acuity.",Missey D

15,Valium,Muscle Spasm,7.0,Taken for 10 years or more,"December 3, 2017",50,I have CP on my right side and down my back along with scoliosis and a bad pars defect for the pain and spasms I take methadone and diclofenac for the pain lyrica for the neuropathy and Valium soma and cannabis for the spasms. I’ve been on the Valium the longest. It’s a double edge sword in that I use it for anxiety and spasms. Before it I was on all the other standard benzodiazepines. Pound for pound it is the safest benzo to be on. It lasts the longest in ur system and self tapers meaning that withdrawal from it are easier than say Xanax or klonipin. I’ve been on Valium for almost 10 years and it has helped tremendously. With it I can get out of bed every day and have quality of life. Recently I switched from generic to name brand,Kaiser soze

19,Valium,Muscle Spasm,9.0,,"April 4, 2017",127,"My new GP has been recommending Valium for over a year for chronic mid-back/facet joint paint and intermittent neck pain (bad disks from C3-C5) and sciatica/torn labrum at right hip, but I resisted her recommendation.  The chronic back pain flares every night, and often wakes me up and forces me out of bed.  It takes several hours for the pain to recede every morning, which is demoralizing.  Three nights ago I started taking 5 mg of valium at bedtime, and each morning I've awakened with less and less pain so that I'm hardly taking any pain medication during the day.
