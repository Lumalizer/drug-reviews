0,Robaxin,Muscle Spasm,9.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"October 29, 2021",0,"Ended up in the hospital with severe back pain. I had a ruptured disc between L1 & S1. I could not sit, stand or walk. My spine has numerous bulging disc from old injuries & the vertebras are eaten up by multiple myeloma. After 2 doctors tried to force me up & out of bed after adding morphine shots and Dilaudid IV’s to my twice a day 15mg extended release morphine tabs with no relief. The 3rd doctor was great & didn’t force me to move. He put me on 6mg of Dexamethasone, 1000mg of Robaxin & 5mg of Valium. With in a matter of hours I could sit up, after a couple of doses I could stand & walk with a walker & after a day & a half I was walking on my own & was discharged from the hospital. Thank God for Robaxin & the other 2 drugs!",Bad bad back
1,Robaxin,Muscle Spasm,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"October 24, 2021",0,"I took Robaxin with 600mg Ibuprofen for pain. There's an aspect of muscle tension or contractures with Neurogenic Thoracic Outlet Syndrome (NTOS) so muscle relaxers been be used to try and manage pain. The idea behind the 600mg Ibuprofen and Robaxin was to have a muscle relaxer with an anti inflammatory working at the same time, I guess to get as close to an analgesic as possible. Day one I could hardly sleep at all and felt like my anti anxiety medication had been negated, very wired and anxious, feeling somewhat mentally off like on the verge of mania. After a week of taking this on the seventh day I felt very strange. I started feeling dizzy but not a spinning dizzy, more like a head rush type dizzy. I started getting hot and cold flashes and felt like my face was going white; I felt very faint. I started to feel every beat of my heart, it felt slow and hard. Then I started seeing little green spots and red tracers; ultimately I just felt sick. I felt like I was either going to have a heart attack or pass out, maybe both",Jinks
2,Robaxin,Muscle Spasm,8.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"September 17, 2021",1,"I began taking this after suffering an extremely painful hamstring injury, which rendered me virtually unable to walk or even sit comfortably, and it put me out of work for a few miserable weeks. It doesn't stop the pain completely but it makes it much more manageable. I can take a couple of these and make it through the day. I recommend mixing it with ibuprofen, just be careful with the dosage. One 750 mg tablet and two 250 mg ibuprofen every 6 hours does the trick for me, but you should check with a doctor first. This isn't a magical pill that will fix you completely, but it definitely helps. The first day I took it, it had no noticeable effect on me, but the second day I felt much better, so it may take a few doses for your body to get used to it. It's no miracle pill but it definitely helps.",Jake
3,Robaxin,Muscle Spasm,8.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"August 13, 2021",0,This medication is the only one that gives flexibility to the top of my spine where the spondylitis troubles me. The relief allows me to participate at a competitive level of pool and relieves the pain of the condition better than other significant analgesics I am prescribed. I cannot say I have suffered any side effects that have had any impact on me going about my daily business or normal activities. Overall it is an effective drug and gives the relief I need when used as prescribed.,JayCue

It just so happens I hurt it Friday night. So he prescribed me Percocet 5/325 and 500mg Robaxin. I told him I was in opioid recovery for almost 6 years and would like to just try the Robaxin.

My symptoms worsened with each day that passed: deep, all-over body aches; swollen & inflamed joints;  stomach pain with intestinal cramping. Not to be gross, but I had constant flatulence and loose bowel movements. I worried that taking Robaxin 500 mg with Lyrica 225 mg would be too sedating...what if there was an emergency, and I couldn't respond to save my disabled son & myself? My doctor assured me that I could react to a smoke detector or help him if he had a seizure...but not to drive. Within two hours of taking both meds, I felt the tension slowly leaving my muscles; I fell asleep & woke up to a sound outside; was able to go back to sleep quickly.

56,Robaxin,Muscle Spasm,9.0,,"January 5, 2012",107,"I have been in pain for years. Surgery 17 years ago, I'm only 39, that has left my back a degenerating mess. I found the right doctor who explained my back scans, remarking that I should be in extreme pain ALWAYS. Yeah, it's gotten there. Robaxin to the rescue! So far it's great. I think I need more frequent dosing. 1500mg per day prescribed. I'm taking 2250 (3 pills). It makes me feel nausea, yet allows me to get to my new job and work without an embarrassing spasm. Mine are BAD, so this medicine is helping. ",Anonymous

The Robaxin has helped in a dramatic way, not 100% but definitely 75-80% better.",Anonymous
58,Robaxin,Muscle Spasm,9.0,,"August 24, 2011",64,"I take Robaxin so that I can stay awake and alert in the daytime, and do more with less pain. I'm on Paracetamol, gabapentin and morphine. If I up the doses of these I become unconscious but if I take Robaxin at night, it helps me sleep. Odd. Not sure of side effects as I have so many from the other medicines. A balancing act of trial and error is needed but well worth getting rid of the pain for a while.",Anonymous

68,Robaxin,Muscle Spasm,10.0,,"August 24, 2008",332,I absolutely love this Medication. After being in a car accident I suffer from permanant back and neck damage. I am also a hair dresser. In order to work I will have to be on Pain killers and muscle relaxers the rest of my life. I started by taking Percocet and grew an allergy to all opiate derivatives. As a result my doctor perscribed me Robaxin. My family has a high tolerance to pain medication so I was afraid that it would not work. I was pleasantly surprised. It worked wonderful and I could still function and focus. An added plus is that there is no possibility of dependancy. I love it.,Anonymous
