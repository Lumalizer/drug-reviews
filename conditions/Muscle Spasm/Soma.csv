0,Soma,Muscle Spasm,10.0,Taken for 10 years or more,"January 11, 2022",2,"I was on Soma for over 10 years without side effects for my Arachnoiditis which is pain disorder caused by the inflammation of the membranes that surround and protect the nerves of the spinal cord. When I turn 65 the government just cut me off of it. Since then I've been trying to find a doctor to prescribe it for me when the opioid crisis occurred. I've never misused my Soma either but I'm being punished... I'm talking about being tortured at times, because of indiscriminate use of that medication.  I can understand people being upset that their loved ones died as a result of abuse and addiction caused by licensed Health practitioners.  I don't understand why Soma (which it's not an opioid) cannot be dispensed in a controlled manor, if it's so dangerous. People with addiction can go places with documentation to prove that they need a certain medication to help them. After receiving a medication for years, experiencing a pain free life then having that medication taken away which resulted in the return of chronic pain, is that called an addiction? I've tried all those other muscle relaxers. No help, some with side effects.",AndyBear
1,Soma,Muscle Spasm,10.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"November 19, 2021",1,"I, like many others, am now having the hardest time getting my Soma prescription back. I was first prescribed this after my car accident in 2015. I have degenerative disc disease, c2-3 & c5-7 herniated discs, straightening of my cervical spine, torn rhomboid muscle, sciatica and numbness & tingling of my arms/hands. I am 29 now & I have been to so many drs thanks to every changing insurance. If my PPO wasn't so expensive to keep I wouldn't be in the predicament I am now on state Medi-Cal insurance. I have been prescribed every other muscle relaxer & currently now trying Flexeril for the 3rd time since my accident and surprise, it still doesn't relieve my spasms or pain it just makes my heart race & then I get a bad headache before I have to lay down, then I get hot and cold flashes & tingling before I fall asleep. I am barely on day 2 of flexeril this time around & I am miserable. I am told over & over they can't prescribe me Soma. Why? It's the only thing that works.. thanks FDA",Mariah
2,Soma,Muscle Spasm,10.0,Taken for 5 to 10 years,"October 29, 2021",0,So this is me: C4 5 6 discectomy. Multiple back and spine degenerative disease. Both arms neuropathy with hands and elbow nerves surgery. Chronic back pain and 17% total nerve damage. I was on Carisaprodol for 6 years 1 350mg 3 times a day. I take Suboxone and gabapentin.  Soma is a good muscle and sleep helper. Unfortunately they no longer have this muscle relaxing medicine in Canada. Like Leratine the meds are not available in Canada. Such a shame because I was  on major narcotics for nearly 2 decades.  How can I possibly get this med in Canada knowing it is only available in America. Soma helped with acute pain chronic pain and sleep aid. Also no side effects or withdrawal symptoms. I have tried everything doctors prescribed. Soma by far was a better helper than all the other powerful drugs that had forced me to take action. Been near 18 years since last I took Soma.,Peter

Said it was not for long-term usage (no studies were ever done).  Thank the good Lord that MVP health insurance took Chloraxazone (the replacement) off their formulary and I had to go back to Soma.  The only disadvantage is the pharmacy can only write me for 9 days (27 pills) at a time.  I don't care, I will take it.

So my doctor put me on this after I asked for something to take that wouldn’t make me sleepy. Although it didn’t make me tired, it also did very little to help with my severe muscle spams.

I have multiple conditions that cause severe, life-long extreme chronic pain.Soma was one of the most-effective medications I ever took.I don't know why she said the whole, ""Addictive"" part to me? I get drug tested by this same doctor every appointment, and have never (ever) had anything come back positive that I wasn't prescribed.Lastly, to disprove the whole withdrawal symptom thing - At least for me, after years of taking it, I have gone on and off of it before and up/down dosages to try and see if I could hold out taking less medication (No, I do not like taking a bunch of medicine all day long, but it is the *only* thing that makes me able to get out of bed and do anything except lay in bed, tortured all day/night).",Long-Time Chronic Pain Patient

My doctor continued  prescribing it through the 2011 crackdown by the feds. All the while saying they’re taking it off the market.On my last visit I heard that he’s closing his practice so if I cannot find another doctor who’ll prescribe it I’m basically so out of luck. Over the last few months I’ve been experiencing soma outages in pharmacies all over this area. The Watson brand (which anyone who takes this med will tell you is the only one that works well) has been acquired by Teva. In my opinion Teva make subpar meds and their carisoprodol is no exception. However, it’s still the one with the DAN 5513 stamp and that’s the only one that works (albeit not as well). So Teva acquires Watson and just stops making it altogether.

It was very helpful when I was laid out, could not move due to back spasm and in incredible pain. It allowed me to move slowly and gently, perform gentle stretches and easy movements for healing. However, with enough dosage, it also comes with an incredibly relaxed feeling, as if all worries are gone and life is a beautiful, often funny experience, full of love. This feeling takes a higher and higher dose to achieve. And comes with side effects like dizziness, sleepiness, lack of motor control. Side effects increase in intensity with increasing dosage to the point of total inability to move limbs and dropping into unconsciousness. I used it occassionally, which increased to weekly for a time. Very addictive, rapid build up of tolerance (from 1/2 pill to 4 for the same medical effect).",Honest
