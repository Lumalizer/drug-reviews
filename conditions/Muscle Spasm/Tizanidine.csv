My heart rate was fast and blood pressure was high - even though the blood vessels on the backs of my hands were bulging out like I'd had too much BP med. I've tried 1mg three different times (1/4 the dose I was prescribed), and it always had the same scary side effects, actually worse each time.

Was put on tizanidine at 2mg every 8 hours a day. Took Par Pharmaceutical manufacturer all these years, and it has helped a lot - not all the pain is gone, but it almost completely eliminated my migraines. My insurance had to change as of this year, and almost 10 years later I had to switch pharmacies. The new pharmacy gave me Apotex manufactured tizanidine. I started having pain and migraines again, but I thought it was due to the stress of the pandemic - we were several months in at this point. It was only recently when I found some leftovers of my old par pharmaceutical tizanidine and took one out of curiousity that I realized the manufacturer change had really set me back - Apotex just doesn't work for me.

After 14 years, this is the first drug that has had any real effect on my upper back and shoulder. First dose was rough. It felt like all the pain I'd felt over the years hit my neck at once.  After that my body relaxed and the next dose was just fine. Life was great and then a month ago they changed manufacturers and I had the neck pain attack, but not as bad this time.  However, that first night and every night since for 3 weeks I have incredibly gruesome nightmares.  If you watched Backcountry and Annihilation, you will get a taste of what was waking me at 4am every day.  I checked the manufacturer,  Dr Reddy's Lab, and they've had issues in the past with potency.  My doc said changing the manufacturer doesn't matter, so I changed doctors instead.  The product still kept the muscle spasms at bay. Time for a different brand. The drug gets a 9 because the only side effect for me are the dark dreams.",thatsnotright

I read reviews on here that terrified me. This drug does make you feel a little weird the first time you take it, but it's not that serious. Don't skip trying it just because of scary reviews online. I try not to take it everyday. I am prescribed 2mg up to 3 times a day but I only take one. I have definitely noticed my number of headache days go down dramatically. I used to have them for up to 4 days in a row and over 15 days a month. My neck still hurts extremely bad. I believe that the zanaflex is relaxing the muscles on my scalp and face which stops most headaches from occuring. But as I said my neck is still bad me. It's better than having neck pain and severe headaches almost every day. But I'm going to ask my doctor for another treatment to help my neck.

Which she knew I could not afford to do. I finally saved up enough money to afford a pain specialist and all the out of pocket expenses that is necessary to find out what is wrong. I was prescribed this medication. Within an hour of taking 4mg at 8pm I was knocked out within an hour. I woke up at midnight foggy and unable to fall asleep until 2am. When I woke up at 7am from a freakishly vivid nightmare I was EVEN MORE groggy which lasted until about 12pm.
