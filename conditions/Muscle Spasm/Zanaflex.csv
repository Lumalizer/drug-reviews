1,Zanaflex,Muscle Spasm,2.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"January 10, 2022",0,It helped me sleep but it made me dizzy and my thinking was off. It also made me nauseated. I was hurting so bad I actually took it 4 times in about  48 hrs even with the nausea. I was still feeling really off 36 hrs after the last dose and would not have trusted my judgement at work.

6,Zanaflex,Muscle Spasm,6.0,,"August 9, 2020",61,"I am prescribed this for neck spasms that cause debilitating chronic headaches and migraines. I read reviews on here that terrified me. This drug does make you feel a little weird the first time you take it, but it's not that serious. Don't skip trying it just because of scary reviews online. I try not to take it everyday. I am prescribed 2mg up to 3 times a day but I only take one. I have definitely noticed my number of headache days go down dramatically. I used to have them for up to 4 days in a row and over 15 days a month. My neck still hurts extremely bad. I believe that the zanaflex is relaxing the muscles on my scalp and face which stops most headaches from occuring. But as I said my neck is still bad me. It's better than having neck pain and severe headaches almost every day. But I'm going to ask my doctor for another treatment to help my neck. Ibuprofen doesn't cut it and I'm not supposed to take it everyday as I am susceptible to ulcers.",Maggie

11,Zanaflex,Muscle Spasm,9.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"May 3, 2019",134,"I just started on zanaflex and I've never experienced such an effective muscle relaxer. I have MS and get really painful spasms and cramps. Have been on Baclofen for years (which hasn't been particularly helpful) and have also tried flexeril and skelaxin, which also did nothing. After taking the zanaflex, I actually felt my muscles relaxing (imagine that!) and could feel blood moving/tingling through my system. Was wonderful. The only problem is that, as others have said, it makes you REALLY drowsy, so I can't take the recommended 4mg dose 3x a day. I'm taking a quarter tablet twice in the daytime and then a full tablet late in the evening when I'm winding down for bed. I will also note that I had been assuming that the occasional slurred speech I was experiencing was a sign of my worsening MS, and now I'm reading reviews showing that Baclofen sometimes does that (!).

Now, as long as I didn't do much, I wouldn't have much pain but getting anything done (like yardwork, working out with pushups, painting a wall...etc) was another story and would leave me in severe pain but always THE NEXT DAY and for at least several days afterward (I never really felt the pain on the day of the activity). Then, my doctor gave me Zanaflex, and now I take one 4 mg tab that night, the next day is pain free! I haven't noticed any side effects, no next day grogginess and even the quality of sleep is normal with pleasant dreaming; in fact, if anything my dreams are slightly easier to remember which shows plenty of REM.",serve ickle

In the beginning, my doctors had me go to physical therapy, take ibuprofen, or aspirin.  None of these things ever really helped.  After trying Flexeril and numerous anti-inflammatories, my pain management doctor did an MRI and found that among the many tension knots and twisting of my spine, I had bulging disks in my neck.  He gave me Zanaflex to take at night.  It knocks me out within 20 minutes but helps relax my back and neck so that I can get restful sleep - been on it for 3 months now!  I highly recommend it for continuous back pain and it's even helped with my migraines.  Be ready for bed though - very powerful!",Chronic Pain in KC

It makes me groggy and I would never do anything that needed full attention taking it.   I take it at night only for sleep.  It's a good medication but be careful if you go on Cipro or Levaquin (antibiotics).
