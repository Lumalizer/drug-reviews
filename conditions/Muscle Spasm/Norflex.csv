1,Norflex,Muscle Spasm,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"August 16, 2021",6,"A pharmacist gave me brufen tablets to take during the day and Norflex at night. I took one tablet of Norflex before bed, only to wake up in the middle of the night in pain again and it felt worse. I decided to take another tablet so that I could sleep again, but two hours later I woke up with the urge to go to the bathroom. I laid there paralyzed and it felt like my brain was swimming in my skull. I couldn't even speak to warn my partner about how I was feeling. Eventually I rolled on to my side grabbing the wall next to my bed to help me get up. It's been 11 hours since I took the last pill and I am still feeling the effects of it. The effects I experienced so far with it is, dry mouth, unbalanced, confused, difficulty with speech, very sleepy and being paralyzed.",Rox28

I was prescribed Norlfex,  first day it didn't do much, day 2 I took it again and then at the end of the day had a dissociative episode and the start of anxiety. Almost like a panic attack was about to kick off. I had battled anxiety for several years and weaned myself off Paroxetine nearly a decade and a half prior so it felt like it was all coming back. Googled after and found a side effect is...anxiety. Be careful if you are prone to this.",Todd
9,Norflex,Muscle Spasm,9.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"September 14, 2018",44,I have spina bifida  with a lot of pain.  I’m a former addict so I can’t take narcotics when the chronic pain is out of control.  When I’m in bad shape my doc gives to shots (IM) of 60 mg of Norflex and 60 mg of toradol...and the two together work so well on my pain-and it lasts all day and I can FUNCTION.  The sad part is I can only  get these shots once every 6 weeks or so because insurance won’t pay for it and it’s hard on your liver I guess.  But to have a combination of drugs that work so well on pain and is non-addictive...they should be used more for those whom are suffering.,Gigi
10,Norflex,Muscle Spasm,10.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"April 11, 2018",24,"I have had lower back pain from degenerated disc since my 30's caused by a fall from a horse, then the same problem in my neck from a car accident. A few years ago I started  getting what I put down to sciatica, then my right leg started collapsing on me and I have had several falls.  I have strange effects to most medications they seem to affect me different to the norm,  Norflex works perfectly on the pain side of things and generally reduces the falling. ( For migraines btw Relpax is amazing.) Norflex is now unavailable and I am desperate to know what to do I am back on Palexia but it has heaps of side effects and doesn't do the job.",Oz

Over the holidays I was unable to get in to see my primary care and ran out of my medications, resulting in a trip to the ER. The ER doc gave me an injection of Norflex and an rx until I was able to get in and see my doc. It has worked amazingly well.

I recently came off of Methadone & Percocet, unintentionally, when I had just enough to get to my appointment with the pain specialist I was scheduled to see for the 1st time, but he got sick & they had to reschedule me.  In addition to withdrawal, my pain level kept rising, to the point that every bone & muscle in my body hurt worse than I have ever been in!!!  It's the only time I've ever used ""9.9"" to describe my pain! I have had to go to the ER several times in the last month.  I was given Norflex 2 of those times, when I had a pinched nerve. Norflex helped SO MUCH MORE than ANY of the muscle relaxers I had at home!",BellaGirlSmiles

Had 3 epidural steroid injections that worked for a while but then faded away. Finally had surgery and as a bodybuilder had a lot of muscle in my lower back to cut through to shave the disk off of the nerve. Was prescribed the Percocet still and Soma for muscle spasms and pain.

I lead a pretty stressful life and every now (once every 3 months or so) and then suffer from muscle spasms in my neck and upper shoulder areas. This can be extremely painful. Sometimes by just taking 2 tables before I go to bed, will cure the problem. I have never needed to take more than 3 doses to relieve the spasm. There have been occasions that I did not have any Norflex and it will take quite a few days for the spasm to pass, even with regular massaging.",KevinfromFlorida
