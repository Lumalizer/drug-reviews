0,Estradiol,Atrophic Vaginitis,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"June 27, 2020",0,"It fell out within one week of inserting the ring.  I didn't notice it when it came out; probably because it is ""clear.""  If it was colored a bright color, I might have noticed before flushing away $500... I have to say that I am unimpressed with the product!",MEGSDC
1,Estradiol,Atrophic Vaginitis,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"January 20, 2020",2,"1 gram of estrogen cream one time caused vaginal burning, diarrhea, and horrible bloating. Will not use again.",SE
2,Estradiol,Atrophic Vaginitis,6.0,,"December 3, 2019",6,"Climara (estradiol):People seem to have issue with keeping the patch in place.  THE ONLY thing that seems to work is Tagaderm hospital  tape, cut a piece and place it over the patch. I do not know why Big Pharma which charges a fortune for this rx does not include  a cut to size  Tagaderm tape piece with every  patch. Surely  they can afford  it and they must know getting the patch to stick is an issue for their users.  Side note,.. the glue on the patch causes my skin to be red,  burn, and itch during first day of new patch, this diminishes  as the week progresses. It works well for symptoms of low energy and achy joints,  muscles, hot flashes.Not so well with the vaginal atrophy, vaginal dryness part, which is too bad. I've been on it for  close to a year and those symptoms  seem to been getting worse,  even with regular  sexual activity. I will be trying the ring.",Grneyegal
3,Estradiol,Atrophic Vaginitis,10.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"October 26, 2019",17,"Estrace (estradiol):This is much better than the generic. It is costing me nearly  $430 a month, but it is worth it.  I have a high-stress job, so my body eats it up. I have been using the generic for years and I felt it should be working better, it just wasn't doing it for me. I decided to try the real one.  It took a month and a half for my body to adjust,  but once it did, I felt ten years younger.  I can now work five days a week, which helps to pay for the medication. I no longer require a nap, the bottom of my feet do not have dry skin anymore, my face looks younger, it filled out. I don't have that gaunt look as much.   The atrophy in my vagina is gone. I feel like exercising and doing things outside of the house. It is worth the money, but it is a shame that it cost so much.",Mela
4,Estradiol,Atrophic Vaginitis,2.0,,"October 23, 2019",12,"Climara (estradiol):If you workout, if you swim , if you take baths**Do Not agree to this patch** it is a waste of $$. In what universe does this stay on for more than two days. It might be ok for someone who never sweats and takes very quick showers. I was really hoping I had found a solution to my symptoms. This is not it.",LF
5,Estradiol,Atrophic Vaginitis,,Taken for less than 1 month,"October 11, 2018",4,"Femring (estradiol):I went into full Menopause at 45 due to radiation for colon cancer. I did not know that was going to happen so suddenly. I've been on Estring for over a year with ok results. Still extremely painful intercourse, sweats and hit flashes. My Gyno switched me to Femring this month. Hopefully it works better for me. I will update in a few weeks and let everyone know how its working for me. Take care!",Lala

8,Estradiol,Atrophic Vaginitis,3.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"July 21, 2016",4,"I believe I don't need to take vagifem ,yes I have  a prolapse ,I am awaiting an operation ,but the side effects have been terrible ,weight loss,loss of appetite ,enlarged stomach ,lethargic ,stomach pain ,So I have decided not to continue with this medication ,",Nanny1086
9,Estradiol,Atrophic Vaginitis,10.0,,"December 10, 2010",48,"Femring (estradiol):This ring provided miraculous results for me. I had severe atrophy which my GYN noticed when tissue was tearing and bleeding as he tried to do my pap smear. I didn't even know I had an issue. After a couple months on the Femring he reported my tissue looked healthy and wonderful, had no side effects from it at all. I had to stop using due to insurance not covering but am now on Estring which is the same thing different brand, but insurance covers that one.",have4paws
10,Estradiol,Atrophic Vaginitis,9.0,,"May 19, 2008",62,"Climara (estradiol):In general, I'm happy with this patch. I have difficulty getting it to stay on for an entire week. It stopped the hot flashes and allowed me to have sex again (thin vaginal tissues caused major problems). I do have asthma, high cholesterol, history of migraines. I don't think I'm having any side effects. The progesterone I have to take with it causes terrible side effects. I'm 57.",shakti411
