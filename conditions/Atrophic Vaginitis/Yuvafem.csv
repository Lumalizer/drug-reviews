0,Yuvafem,Atrophic Vaginitis,8.0,,"June 28, 2021",3,"I only have tried Yuvafem and am very pleased with this generic product.  I was shocked to learn I had Atrophic Vaginitis and had extreme discomfort due to this condition. I am in excellent health and started the fourteen day, initial treatment.  I had no problems with the packaging and none of the tablets fell out of the applicator.  It took a month for the symptoms to abate and I am so grateful there is a solution to this condition.  Is everything like it was before I had symptoms?  No.  But it's greatly improved and I do recommend this synthetic version of estrogen for women who are experiencing problems.",judyjane98
1,Yuvafem,Atrophic Vaginitis,8.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"June 21, 2021",2,"In the beginning I had repeated UTI's. One dr suggested it might be menopause systems. I went to the gynecologist and she gave me Imvexxy first. It did not help. I still had the terrible burning, so she switched me to the Yuvafem. I've been taking it for a couple of months now. I don't really like the applicator, it hurts. If you use lubricant it will go in easier. sometimes I have no symptoms at all. But for what ever reason they will come back, not as bad but its there. I have to use replens moisturizer on those days. I never tried the other, my insurance will only pay for the Yuvafem even though I was written a script for the name brand and not Yuvafem. I have not had any joint pain or discharge. If the insert is not inserted all the way up to plunger that you push in ,the pill will come out. I only had the pill fall out once. I knew I had not put it all the way in. So far that is the only one I have found.",domino606

Yuvafem application tool very uncomfortable to insert. About 2 weeks of using this product, had some discharge & itching. Thought - yeast infection & purchased a 3 Day OTC. But didn't use & next day the symptoms were gone. After 2.5 months of using Yuvafem, recently started noticing what looked like a brownish discharge/spotting. Spoke to Obgyn's nurse, decided to wait till Monday & see if better. That night I had burning inside my abdomen. All weekend felt like I had a UTI with abdominal & back pain. Monday my GP doc did a urine test which was negative. After additional 24 hrs, culture was still negative for UTI. At that point, started reading reviews about the Yuvafem & found many similar stories to what I am experiencing.

Yuvafem seems to help, but the applicator upon insertion causes cuts and causes bleeding  (which in my case causes quite a scare.  My gynecological oncologist told me to insert it by hand.  This is an extremely expensive drug.  Couldn't it be made without the applicator to cut costs for those of us who can not use the applicator as long as the instructions included proper hygiene?",Putty

Started having extreme itching, so washed regularly and applied moisturizer. Then burning started too and nothing helped to get over itchy, burning, and then burnt skin.I stopped yuvafem when spotting started. Skin began to clear up after two weeks. Then I used one tablet and extreme itching and skin was burnt again. I began to have pain in my joints, so bad that I entered a emergency room. I went off Yuvafem and 5 days later could walk again. After only one tablet, joint pain and burnt skin returned. My doctor could not find anything. He suggested that I was allergic to Yuvafem. So today decided to check reviews and found that Yuvafem is a dangerous drug.",Elana

14,Yuvafem,Atrophic Vaginitis,1.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"December 17, 2019",16,"I switched to Yuvafem after my insurance stopped covering my Estring, which was about $520 out of pocket as my insurance flat out refused to pay after I've been using it for a year. I've tried all three, the Estring ($520 3-months), the Yuvafem ($20 generic, 3 months), then Vagifem (brand $155 for 8 pills) and my favorite was the Estring, followed by Vagifem. Yuvafem did absolutely nothing except give me a yeast infection. I still bled during sex despite all the lubrication I could muster up and I felt absolutely nothing. I also hated the square-tipped applicator and the dangerous sharp foil. Instead of helping, Yuvafem gave me an infection. I asked my OB-GYN for a prescription of the brand-name Vagifem and the cost just went up again as my insurance now considers it maintenance therapy. I may just give up and pay the $2,000 a year for the Estring.",LeafyBee
15,Yuvafem,Atrophic Vaginitis,8.0,Taken for 5 to 10 years,"December 2, 2019",14,"I used Vagifem at first until the generic Yuvafem came out and I started using it.  Both have helped me and I never had a problem with the Yuvafem falling out of my body or giving me bad side effects.  I do see more difficulty separating the packages but usually use scissors. No pills have ever fallen out of the dispenser either.  I know it is helping me because when I had knee replacement surgery, they suggested I stop the HRT for 30 days because of danger of post-surgery blood clots, and I must say I was miserable.  It felt like my bottom was falling out and I couldn’t wait to get back on them.  Now that I am retired and have different medical insurance it looks like I will have to pay a lot more for this medicine than the $4 monthly I was paying.",Loren
16,Yuvafem,Atrophic Vaginitis,1.0,,"October 23, 2019",72,Amneal had two companies producing their Yuvafem product. One company located in the USA (pink packaging) and the other in Denmark (blue packaging). I did not experience issues with the product manufactured in Denmark although the packaging was inferior to Vagifem. Amneal no longer uses the company in Denmark. The product in the pink packaging manufactured in the USA is as awful as the many negative reviews reflect. Burning and itching was the worse negative symptoms for me. Why is the FDA not aggressively addressing this. I have been battling with Amneal and it isn't a pleasant experience. I plan to escalate to the Attorney General of my state. Unfortunately too many politicians take money from the pharmaceutical companies so they do nothing to help stop the this abuse. I also take issue with the majority of insurance companies refusing to cover Vagifem or charge exhorbitant copays for a medication women need to maintain good health yet many have no problem with covering Viagra.,AE
17,Yuvafem,Atrophic Vaginitis,1.0,,"October 19, 2019",37,"Switched to this product and it was horrible. I thought could have sex again and it was painful and got  an infection. I used this as prescribed. This product does not melt properly at all. This product should not be used as saw 3 doctors for UTI and the embarrassment of being accused it was my partner fault. It was not. It was product. No woman should have to go through this. Did not want this product, it is insurance trying to cut corners. It cost them more in long run  due to the number of  doctor visits and 3 rounds of antibotics and one emergency visit. Sex was painful and vagina dry after using.. gyno said tablets not melting..

19,Yuvafem,Atrophic Vaginitis,1.0,,"June 22, 2019",32,"I have used Vagifem for years without any issues whatsoever. It worked well and caused no problems. Then my insurance switched me to Yuvafem and it's been a nightmare. If I could give this drug a zero, I would have. Burning, redness, the feeling of having a UTI, then actually getting a UTI for the first time in 20 years, painful intercourse. The drug is completely ineffective for what it is supposed to do and it is causing plenty of problems. When I looked at the ingredients, I see that  estradial is the same but the carrier ingredients are different, specifically Yuvafem uses propylene glycol. So, I could deal with the awful packaging if the drug actually worked and didn't cause so many problems, but it doesn't work and had me thinking I had some terrible infection for the last 3 weeks till my dr and I figured out it was the Yuvafem. I will be trying out the Estring and if I can't deal with it, I will be paying the big bucks and go back to the Vagifem.",Whitney

No wonder I had constant burning whenever I used this drug.  FDA needs to be alerted so other women will not be harmed by it.   I had three biopsies of my skin in the vaginal area, which all  came back as precancerous.

25,Yuvafem,Atrophic Vaginitis,1.0,,"March 14, 2019",50,"**Update from my review dated November 7, 2018**I formally contacted the FDA in regards to what I felt was questionable efficacy of Yuvafem and its poor packaging  (as compared to the brand-name Vagifem).  The FDA contacted Amneal Pharmaceuticals and Amneal agreed to look into my complaint about Yuvafem's efficacy and its packaging.  Amneal wanted me to provide them with the Yuvafem that I had leftover, which I did.  It was to be sent back to them anonymously with just a brief history of my experience while on the medication.  Since it was done anonymously, I won't have follow up in regards to my complaint, but at least the FDA responded to it and contacted them.  I hope this helps others who have noticed a difference after being changed to Yuvafem, or who were started on it initially and continue to have symptoms consistent with atrophic vaginitis.  If you feel the drug is not therapeutically beneficial to you, please contact the FDA to let them know.  It can be done online.",Westwind Lisa

Have to use scissors and have cut my fingers on the packaging. The applicator is not very comfortable but works fine. I’ve never had a problem with tablets falling out or not dissolving completely.

I no longer had vaginal dryness. Sexual intercourse was pain and irritation free. About 4 months ago my insurance company stopped covering this drug. I was switched to Yuvafem. I agree with others that the packaging is much inferior to Vagifem’s. I have the same problem opening etc. But I could adjust to the inconvenience. However, I am going back on Vagifem because of how ineffective Yuvafem is. My labia and vagina are very dry again. Sexual intercourse is very painful. It is just like before I went on Vagifem. I feel Yuvafem is a waste of my money and has caused me pain and discomfort while promising to provide the same results as Vagifem.

I started experiencing a significant increase in vaginal irritation, vulvar dryness, and urinary frequency.  I had been having vaginal discharge the day after I inserted the tablet with increased irritation and itching.  I never had any significant discharge or irritation when using Vagifem. My symptoms got so bad that at the end of September I went back on brand-name Vagifem.  My symptoms have been gradually improving.

I was sore all the time.  Just recently my doctor prescribed brand only (Vagifem), but the insurance wouldn't release it until I used up the other.  I argued with them and my doctor wouldn't get involved saying they had no ability to overrule the insurance company.  Why does the insurance control our health??  Shouldn't the doctor's change in prescription be enough?  Finally, a kindly pharmacist intervened and got me a prescription for Vagifem.

I did well on Vagifem for 4 yrs. When generic Yuvafem was dispensed for my Rx I thought there was some decrease in potency.  The packaging is awful - must use scissors to separate units or leave intact & carefully slice through foil with your fingernail to remove product-hoping that the pill remains intact in the process.  Recently Yuvafem was replaced with a new mfg - Teva.  I can't believe this is actually medication. My s/s of an 'impending UTI' (urgency, frequency) have returned after approx 4 weeks use of Teva product.  Not effective at all.",FG88

I thought I wasn’t doing it regularly enough or too much so I tried both for a month each. Now I am calling the doctor to cancel this prescription. I can’t afford vagifem right now but THIS ISN'T WORKING.  And yeah, the pills all fall out of the applicator and don’t seem to dissolve well. Plus so much environmental waste!!",KateM27

As far as effectiveness goes, I see no difference between this drug and Vagifem, but I still wish I could use Vagifem - too expensive though.",NicknameDeeDee

I have a feeling my copay will go from $30. to $50. but it's worth it to get results.

I asked my doctor if there is anything cheaper and she told me to used Crisco 2x a week and Yuvafem once a week. I have and it works!

It has not improved my condition at all but empty my purse. Not refilling the prescription.

My first observation was with the packaging - the perforations between the individual units were nearly impossible to separate and when I did, the foil cover of the adjacent units would break open. I use a scissors now to cut them apart. Secondly, after about 4 weeks, I've noticed that vaginal irritation and urine leakage symptoms are returning. I'll use up my present 90-day supply and see how things go, but if symptoms worsen any more, I will ask my doc for a DAW (Dispense As Written) Vagifem prescription.

Was treated with oral antibiotics, and within a couple of days the vaginal spotting stopped as well. My GYN has since found a benign cervical polyp and attributed the spotting to that, but I'm not convinced. I have never suffered from UTIs so this was too much of a coincidence. I believe the excessive discharge from Yuvafem led to bacterial overgrowth, spotting, and subsequent urinary tract/kidney infection. I'm back to Estrace cream.",Not a fan of Yuvafem
