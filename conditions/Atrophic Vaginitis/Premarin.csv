1,Premarin,Atrophic Vaginitis,10.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"August 29, 2020",39,"Premarin is a complete game changer. I had a 10cm mass on ovary and uterine hyperplasia. I thought things couldn't get any worse with pain and discomfort. This resulted in full hysterectomy and oophorectomy.  Then, it went from bad to worse. Atrophy. Sex was so painful I gave up. Even urination was a challenge some days. This went on for a year. Then I started using Premarin. Within a week, things started to improve. I hesitated using Premarin because of some bad advice from the internet. Premarin is a complete  game changer. I wish I would have tried it sooner. I have my sex life back and feel like my old self. Incredible!",West Coast

6,Premarin,Atrophic Vaginitis,10.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"November 19, 2014",73,"I went on the medicine at age 65 due to extreme dryness and constant yeast infections. The fantastic side effect is now I fall to sleep within one hour of going to bed. For six years, ever since menopause, I have had trouble falling asleep (averaging only 4 hrs of rest). The only change in my life was the Premarin pill.  It helped the dryness and now I can function with 8 hours of sleep!",kuli
7,Premarin,Atrophic Vaginitis,6.0,,"November 19, 2014",25,"I was prescribed with Premarin vaginal cream to use for 2 weeks prior pap. I had total hysterectomy 9 months ago. I experienced severe acid stomach from this medicine. I have a history of stomach acid so I didn't put the 2 together. I took my usual med, avoided food that could trigger acid but to no avail. I suffered for 5 days of severe acid stomach until I decided to stop the cream that night. The following day, my stomach still sore but not acidic. I woke up with a headache. I didn't think the cream will affect me this way since its effects are limited in vaginal area. I was wrong. I can confirm that my acid stomach was due to Premarin vaginal cream.",Carlit a
8,Premarin,Atrophic Vaginitis,,,"February 13, 2012",52,I've been on it almost 3 years. I had to start using this in my mid twenties. I can use very little to the normal amount every 3 days or so. I go by how I feel more then anything. I do notice belly swelling the next day and I do get headaches if I use to much. Other then that I love this and I'll keep using it. Make sure you get your yearly check ups/blood work and you'll be fine.,cdluce
