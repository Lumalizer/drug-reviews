0,Estrace,Atrophic Vaginitis,10.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"October 26, 2019",17,"This is much better than the generic. It is costing me nearly  $430 a month, but it is worth it.  I have a high-stress job, so my body eats it up. I have been using the generic for years and I felt it should be working better, it just wasn't doing it for me. I decided to try the real one.  It took a month and a half for my body to adjust,  but once it did, I felt ten years younger.  I can now work five days a week, which helps to pay for the medication. I no longer require a nap, the bottom of my feet do not have dry skin anymore, my face looks younger, it filled out. I don't have that gaunt look as much.   The atrophy in my vagina is gone. I feel like exercising and doing things outside of the house. It is worth the money, but it is a shame that it cost so much.",Mela
