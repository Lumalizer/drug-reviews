3,Leuprolide,Precocious Puberty,4.0,Taken for 5 to 10 years,"February 29, 2020",7,"Lupron Depot-PED (leuprolide):I have a slim body type, small breast and only reached 5 feet. I took the lupron injection for many years. I am now 22 and deal with irregular periods, chronic headaches, chronic neck and back pain and weakness. I’ve experienced episodes of numbness, tingling and confusion. It’s frustrating to not know whether these are long term effects from the Lupron injection when other test results have came back negative. It feels like a dead end to receive some kind of relief and live a normal life.",Canadian

5,Leuprolide,Precocious Puberty,,Taken for 5 to 10 years,"June 3, 2019",9,"Lupron Depot-PED (leuprolide):My daughter was diagnosed with precocious puberty at the age of 2, however she was born with enlarged breast buds, so she was probably born with it, however it wasn't diagnosed until she was 2.  She did Lupron injections every 28 days until the age of 9.  Once she turned 9 one injection a month was not enough so she had the Suprellin LA implant for 2 years until she was 11.  Blood tests and xrays always came back fine while on treatment.  She did have a couple years where she was a bit overweight but that all went away.  My daughter is now 18 and is suffering from joint pain, muscle weakness, lack of strength, moodiness, hand and wrist swelling, tiredness, numbness, tingling, painful periods, etc.  The more I read the more I think Lupron is the cause of her problems now.   If I would have known then what I know now, I don't think we would have proceeded with the Lupron injections.",JLAM
6,Leuprolide,Precocious Puberty,9.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"February 20, 2019",3,Lupron Depot-PED (leuprolide):My daughter started her treatment while still in elementary due to early development and strong under arm odors.  The treatment went well through the whole treatment with regular blood testing and all.  It wasn’t until she was done with the whole treatment did she start getting all these stretch marks.  First under get buttocks and now at age 17 and at 5’6 she has the stretch marks going all the way down her legs.

The stretch marks are really bad looking all over her lower body and I don’t know what to do.  Thank god my daughter doesn’t let that stop her from wearing shorts or bathing suits.,Stretch marks

I wish children weren't subjected to this. I had so many painful side effects after treatment. There was a point during my treatment where it was too painful to sit down or even walk.

My daughter also started Lupron PED at 2 years old. She's now 4. It has reversed her chest development and her growth is more on track now. But I'm just finding out about all these bad side affects. I haven't heard of anyone else starting the medicine so early like her, so I was wondering if your daughter ever had/has any bad side affects from using it.

12,Leuprolide,Precocious Puberty,,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"August 22, 2016",13,"Lupron Depot-PED (leuprolide):I started Lupron when my daughter was 6 going on 7 years due to under arm odor, breast buds, pubic hair and fear of her getting her period at an early age.  The treatment did not reverse the budding of the breast or pubic, her pubic hair growth only increased, neither am I certain if it preventing her from getting her period sooner.  I am certain that it stunted your growth, which is a common side effect.  About 3 months ago  her Dr , informed me that though he prescribed this treatment for her CPP and it is covered by the insurance, the insurance almost never covers the growth hormone he mentioned would be needed for her to regain the height she lost, he had never mentioned this before.

My bone age at that time was of a 10 year old. Now at 18, I have gained a lot of weight every year after stopping the medication. Although I don't seem like a person that weighs a lot, my BMI is on the higher end of normal. In addition to that, while on the treatment, I had a lot of acne. Apart from that, my periods are extremely irregular. I guess everyone handles medications and treatment differently. However, I would not recommend this drug at all. Firstly, it's extremely expensive if you do not have insurance. Secondly, people are supposed to grow by themselves. This drug has more negative side effects than positive ones.",P.S.777777

She gained alot of weight. Became obese, has a lot of stretch marks, has high cholesterol, high sugar levels, sleep apnea, uses a cpap machine to sleep. She fights with me to binge eat. I am so sad I feel guilty for using this drug. I wish I would have let her get her period she would have only struggled for a little bit with that, than with a life time of health issues. Who cares if they stay shorter, short is beautiful too, and even big is beautiful but this med gives health problems that did exist.

My endocrinologist suggested I start Lupron, and I did. It did exactly what it was supposed to do.. I quit growing taller, and stopped puberty-like symptoms. One problem- I did not grow taller, but I was still eating. I gained a lot of weight, but the doctors promised that once I quit the shots everything would even out.  I quit the shots after 7 years of treatment, and it did not ""even out"".
