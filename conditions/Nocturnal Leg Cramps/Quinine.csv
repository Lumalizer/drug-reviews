5,Quinine,Nocturnal Leg Cramps,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"August 23, 2015",3,"Took 1 dose on evening of Aug 5/15. Felt unwell on Aug 6. Slept for 2 hours in the afternoon. That night I became agitated. Then began to perspire, feel shaky and had repeated muddy like stools, though not diarrhea. I developed excruciating pain in my back, first in the lower hip area radiating down my legs then up my back to my neck, and even the backs of my upper arms. The pain was so bad I couldn't tolerate any pressure and had to rest on my stomach. About 3 hours into this increasingly bad situation, I vomited 2 times bringing up both my lunch and dinner. This alleviated the upper back pain sufficient for me to get some rest. But I developed numbness in both forearms that is still present today Aug 23/15. No help from doctors.",galbers
6,Quinine,Nocturnal Leg Cramps,10.0,,"March 29, 2015",21,"I use 1/4 tablet as needed (averages 1 time a week)  when the cramps come on.  They come suddenly and usually after being on my feet for many hours.  There is no stopping them, i,e, walking, rubbing, stretching.  They are the most painful experience you can imagine.  The results after taking the quinine are almost immediate.  Cramps stop, like a miracle.  Sometimes they return in a few minutes and I take a second 1/4 tab.  Never have I had to take more than that.  I worry about running out of the ones I have because I thought doctors could no longer write prescriptions for quinine. No side effects.",HoneyCrackers

8,Quinine,Nocturnal Leg Cramps,,Taken for 5 to 10 years,"November 11, 2013",25,"I found this medicine in February, 2006 and my life changed dramatically. No more waking up in the night several times screaming as my muscles tore themselves apart up and down my legs. I have cramps in EVERY muscle, including the larger muscles in the front of the upper leg, and often involving the muscles from the groin  to the ankle inside of the leg. They took it off the market in 2008 and I did not sleep again until I was told I could buy it again July, 2013. Now, the manufacturer is not going to make it anymore?. I have 20 pills left, as I have to take it daily with a timer on my phone that reminds me at 7 PM every day. I am so sad and depressed that I will no longer be able to get this medicine. I will be afraid to go to bed again.",Green WV
9,Quinine,Nocturnal Leg Cramps,10.0,Taken for 5 to 10 years,"May 16, 2012",26,Qualaquin (quinine):When quinine was dropped and Qualaquin introduced I had to then fight my doctor for my prescriptions. I go from getting maybe 4-5 hrs sleep when taking it to 30 min x 4-5 times a day broken sleep. Without Qualaquin my quality of life goes from non-existent to manageable.,jeribug

12,Quinine,Nocturnal Leg Cramps,10.0,,"January 7, 2011",45,"Qualaquin (quinine):I had been on Quinine sulfate several years ago, for severe leg cramps in both legs and at that time is was a generic medication,  then FDA took all off the market  and allowed it to be brought back as a classified medicine, of course at a very high rate.  But this works!  I was at the breaking point with the pain, now I can still work, walk and sleep a full night without pain. What a wonderful feeling that is.Thank you.",Stormy47
13,Quinine,Nocturnal Leg Cramps,10.0,,"October 1, 2010",24,It is so upsetting that I can no longer get Quinine Sulfate for use when my legs cramp at night.  I call my symptoms Dancing Legs because they just won't calm down without quinine.  ,Anonymous
14,Quinine,Nocturnal Leg Cramps,10.0,,"March 5, 2010",47,"Qualaquin (quinine):I develop severe legs cramps at night for some reason and found that Qualaquin works for me.  Also, I have COPD- bronchial asthma and suffer with tightening of the chest muscles, not sure why.  When I take Qualaquin, I have noticed the chest muscle relaxes, and I can breathe without the constant coughing. It gives me some time to physically recuperate for a couple of hours.

15,Quinine,Nocturnal Leg Cramps,8.0,,"January 8, 2010",22,I had been using Quinine Sulphate capsules for many years for severe leg cramps at night.  I did not take a capsule every day but only when I had been on my feet all day and sometimes after a long day of golf or walking in heeled shoes.  My doctor felt I was responsible enough to give me a bottle of 100 pills.  This often lasted me well into two years or so.  I have had leg cramps once again often since I was unable to purchase these capsules any longer.   If they are again available I will be  really content to once again be able to rid myself of severe cramps at least most of the time if I think of the circumstances of my day.,Anonymous

17,Quinine,Nocturnal Leg Cramps,10.0,,"June 25, 2009",37,"I've learned the warning sign of an impending leg cramp and I always keep a small supply of 200 mg quinine sulfate accessible.  I use very small containers and have one in the car, one in my backpack when hiking and one in my pocket when out and about. My leg cramps are so painful that it seems that the muscle is tearing itself apart and luckily the pills are within easy reach so the tension ends within a couple of minutes.",leaping Mike
