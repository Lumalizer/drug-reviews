0,Verapamil,Nocturnal Leg Cramps,9,Taken for less than 1 month,"June 17, 2020",3,"Started taking this drug 24 hours ago. History of moderate/severe leg cramps, which quinine had controlled for several years. With the recent addition of a biologic medication for asthma, my cramps became worse 10 fold. I found the previous review and did some research along with discussions with my specialist and regular doctor. My doctor agreed to let me try it as my blood pressure has been a little elevated of late. Since on this medication I have not had a cramp. I've had a few twitches here and there, but nothing a little stretch can't fix.",Myster C
1,Verapamil,Nocturnal Leg Cramps,9,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"March 16, 2015",18,"Calan SR (verapamil):for several years I had SEVERE night time leg cramps.  They got so bad that the veins in my legs would bulge out of my skin from my toes to my groin area.  I would be unable to walk so my husband would help me to the tub where he would have it filled with the hottest water I could tolerate, which really helped a lot, and I would take 2 OTC leg cramp pills.  But the veins popping ou got so severe my husband took me to the Dr. (Again!) and we explained about the veins popping out.  He sat there for a moment and then like a light bulb came on he said "" Let's try something.  I'm going to put you on a channel blocker and let's see if that helps.""  That was 2 years ago and I no longer get leg cramps where the veins are popping out!",Gramma Beev
