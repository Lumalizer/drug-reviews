0,Soma,Nocturnal Leg Cramps,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"March 7, 2022",1,"I have to admit, reading these comments is upsetting. The US just broke a record: 100,000 people died of opiate overdoses in a single 365-day window (yes, surpassing deaths from alcohol), yet everyone here believes it could or would never happen to them.  This drug works fantastically well for me, but I'm also no longer able to get it due to recent restrictions. :(",Glenn
1,Soma,Nocturnal Leg Cramps,10.0,,"June 24, 2020",38,"My leg cramps are so very painful. I've been taking Soma for about 8 year's which have worked quick in taking away the cramping. My current medical provider says that soma is a dirty drug. I hate to disagree but since they quit prescribing the soma, my leg cramping has gotten much worse. How can I convince them that soma is the only answer to my chronic cramping pain.",LDBRIX

4,Soma,Nocturnal Leg Cramps,10.0,Taken for 10 years or more,"May 9, 2018",105,"I haven taken Soma for many years for a combination of back pain issues and leg cramps at night. I only took two a day, once at 4pm and once at bedtime. I did take four a day at one time. It works wonders! I don't have a ""hangover"" I don't need opiates for pain, only Motrin, and I am not a pill seeker. Now, my doc is also scared of the DEA thanks to the idiots who eat this like candy and wants me to take some other muscle relaxer rx'd for multiple sclerosis that ""isnt on the schedule."" REALLY?  This is a small dose, it works, whats going on here? The government needs to get out of peoples medicine chests and their business and let the doctors do their jobs with their trusted patients.",squjirrelgirl
5,Soma,Nocturnal Leg Cramps,10.0,Taken for 10 years or more,"August 12, 2014",153,I have been taking Soma for 14 years and Dr's have tried giving me other muscle relaxants that do not work. When I first started taking them I felt relief very fast. My script is for 4 a day. I usually take 2 at bedtime and they give me the rest I need. They are great for leg cramps and any other muscle problems you may have. They have never made me feel weird or out of it. They don't make me feel drowsy the next day. If I am having a really bad day I will take one mid morning and then in the late afternoon. These work the best and I am not addicted to them.,redrobin73

7,Soma,Nocturnal Leg Cramps,10.0,,"May 28, 2013",147,"This medicine is a God-send! For years I struggled with restless legs, hypnic jerks and sciatic pain. It was torture. After one dose of Soma, the legs stopped hurting and jerking me awake every 45 minutes.  The dopamine agonists (Mirapex and Requip, which made me impossibly nauseated) were not a viable option.  Finally, my doctor said, ""let's try Soma""; needless to say, the relief was instant and wondrous!  The torture is over!  The respite from the incessant twitching is nothing short of life changing.  I take 525mg just before bed and I am at peace.  Sweet, sweet peace! PS: I only take it 30 minutes before bed.",Samuel O'Reilly
8,Soma,Nocturnal Leg Cramps,10.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"September 21, 2012",105,"I had muscle spasms that awoke me from a dead sleep. Soma worked wonders and very quickly too. Tastes horrible when chewed, but I got complete relief in about 10 minutes, and when you are in that much pain, every moment counts.",Anonymous
