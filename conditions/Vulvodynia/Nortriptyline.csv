0,Nortriptyline,Vulvodynia,,Taken for less than 1 month,"July 20, 2021",8,"For anyone out there searching for answers to their neuropathic pain this was mine. I have only been taking this drug at 10mg for 3 weeks and I have already begun to see huge improvements. I suffer from pudendal neuralgia and have tried nerve blocks, gabapentin, pregabalin, physical therapy, acupuncture, NSAIDs, benzos, the list goes on. Nortriptyline was my last resort and it has changed my life. My pain has reduced by 80%, I can wear the clothes I want, sit for longer periods of time, and be intimate with my SO. Don’t let the fact that it is an antidepressant deter you from taking this drug. It is a life saver.",Pain Jane

7,Nortriptyline,Vulvodynia,8.0,Taken for 10 years or more,"February 27, 2013",38,"This medicine completely helped my vulvodynia.  At my worst before the medication, I was in constant burning pain and could not sit down for extended periods of time. Nortriptyline started working for me after about two weeks. At first I was a little dizzy and very sleepy. I did have more constipation. But the sleepy/dizzy feeling did wear off, and I was so happy to have the edge taken off the pain, I didn't mind the side effects. I was on it for about 10 years with minimal pain flareups. I am doing better now. The pain is not completely gone, but nortriptyline was the answer I needed.",Anonymous
