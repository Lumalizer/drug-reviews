0,Tramadol,Vulvodynia,10,Taken for less than 1 month,"August 26, 2020",7,"Superb relief from the searing, burning and tearing sensation of vulvodynia.  I had an allergic reaction to Monistat and simultaneously developed a sensitivity to an SSRI that was disrupting my estrogen and flaring my interstitial cystitis.  I had a storm of nerve pain in my bladder, vagina and vulva and a vagina that felt like it was full of paper cuts.  A round of Prednisone calmed the allergic reaction.  I tried gabapentin once again for nerve pain and still couldn't tolerate the side effects.  Just 5 or 6 doses (25-50mg) of Tramadol calmed my pain so I could sit without ice and begin pelvic floor PT.  Once the SSRI was out of my system, about four weeks later, I got a normal period and my vulvodynia calmed down.",Random Task
1,Tramadol,Vulvodynia,10,,"July 30, 2016",39,"I've tried everything! 800mg Ibuprofen, Amitriptyline, Valium suppositories (oral form as well), and pretty much every narcotic.. Tramadol was the only one that gave me my life back. I wasn't able to function or complete daily activities before. I've had Vulvodynia for 5 years, with no pain relief. This is my miracle drug! Just one 50mg dose can have me feeling NORMAL. 95% pain-free! I'm praying that I can find a doctor to prescribe me this for vaginal pain/muscle spasms. I've only tried 2 temporary scripts so far for ""as needed"" basis. It would mean the world to me to feel like myself again (forgot what that was like), just until I can find a way to heal my condition. My heart goes out to anyone suffering. Hang in there, there is hope..",Jessannmariee
2,Tramadol,Vulvodynia,8,,"February 15, 2014",24,"I initially started taking tramadol for my vulvodynia. When my psoriatic arthritis was diagnosed I transitioned to hydrocodone but after a couple months I couldn't tolerate the side effects. I am back on tramadol. It doesn't  work as well on my pain as well the hydrocodone, but I don't have the nasty side effects either.",Jenjen5711
3,Tramadol,Vulvodynia,7,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"January 7, 2014",11,I have very painful episodes of pain associated with lichen sclerosus.  I am not a daily user but when I have peak pain levels of 6 or 7 tramadol has been helpful and allows my body to return to a more tolerable pain level after a few doses. So far I haven't used more than 2-3 50mg tabs daily for a few days at a time. My pains are controlled better by topicals but when pain peaks after exercise or physical demanding tasks tramadol along with topicals have made life at those times more bearable. Vulvodynia probably may have painful experiences comparable to those of painful Lichen Sclerosus with disfiguring skin changes.,Vickylane
4,Tramadol,Vulvodynia,10,,"April 10, 2013",43,Amazing relief!  I had to take two 50mg pills at once for it to work.  Works the best out of any medication I have tried.,Lucyann12
