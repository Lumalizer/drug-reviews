0,Elavil,Vulvodynia,7,,"May 11, 2013",26,"Use of Elavil has not lessened the pain associated with vulvodynia (or nerve ending pain), but it seems I can tolerate it more.  But I notice that my throat gets very dry and my voice is hoarse.  Also I have been diagnosed with dry eye, and I do feel that is caused by the Elavil (along with dry mouth and throat).",BRAGS
1,Elavil,Vulvodynia,7,,"January 23, 2011",26,"Amitriptyline made a huge difference to my daily life in terms of pain relief from Vulvodynia, but it has many side effects.  I stuck to a low level 25mg and had to wiegh up benefits vs side-effects.  Changed to Nortriptyline and had the same benefits but less side-effects.  Now take 30mg of Nortriptyline.",Anonymous
