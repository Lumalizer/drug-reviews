1,Simethicone,Gas,8.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"February 18, 2022",1,"I deal with severe IBS on an almost daily basis, and most brands of simethicone help a lot when it comes to relieving gas.  A word of warning however  -  be sure to read the inactive ingredients list!  Some brands contain sorbital, which can cause painful reactions in many IBS sufferers, including gas!  Gas-X uses sorbitol and mannitol in some of its formulations, so choose carefully.",Lab Mom

4,Simethicone,Gas,10.0,Taken for 10 years or more,"August 22, 2021",4,I had gall bladder removed not long ago. Terrible bloating and gas pains. I buy the cheapest brand of simethicone that I can find and it works wonders! I usually take two and the bloat is gone in several hours. What's funny to me is reading what people have written about farting. Hahaha. How else would a person pass gas! My doctor doesn't recommend 4 pills per day but an occasional 2 will be fine!,Nona

8,Simethicone,Gas,10.0,,"June 29, 2020",145,Gas-X (simethicone):I was having terrible terrible stomach pains. Couldn’t fall asleep or get comfortable. Couldn’t even stand up straight. My girlfriend was tired of hearing me moan so she suggested I take a Gas X. After about 3-4 minutes the pain started to break up and my bowels were able to move the gas build up out in the form of a fantastic symphony of flatulence. Absolute bowl ringers for about an hour. Not only was it great relief. It was just a great time. Wonder if you can just take this product for fun? I don’t know. But if you have stomach or gas pains. This is the product.,Anonymous

It felt like I was having a heart attack and my stomach was about to blow up all at once. Thank God I found my Gas X Maximum Strength. I took 2 soft gels and waited.

11,Simethicone,Gas,8.0,,"April 29, 2020",60,Gas-X (simethicone):Just coming off antibiotics for diverticulitus & could not get my gut to  settle down. After over a week of severe gas & bloating with no relief in sight the Dr told me to try Gas-x. I took the maximum & for the next 3 hours burped & farted. It was both relieving and intense. I felt like there was a war going on inside of me. Finally things calmed down & I'm greatly relieved.,Diver

16,Simethicone,Gas,8.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"June 4, 2019",13,"Ovol (simethicone):I find Ovol Chewables easy to use and fairly fast-acting.  But like one of the other reviewers, I find the gummy reside on the roof of my mouth annoying.

17,Simethicone,Gas,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"November 3, 2018",19,"Ovol (simethicone):Ovol 35mg Gas relief chewable tablets has two main inconveniences. First he is ineffective/very slow to work, so with one tablet I did not notice any difference and the problem persisted. Even when I took another tablet it was not resolved (and this pattern happens every time), so by the time you take the third, you don’t know if it actually works but super slowly or it does not (compared to other brands that work instantaneously from the first tablet). The second annoying issue is that when you chew the tablet some substance similar to bubble gum sticks on the top of your throat, it is a very uncomfortable residue from the tablet, it does not dissolve completely. So in total, I will not recommend this medication nor purchase it again because of his ineffectiveness and the weird substance that it leaves in the mouth.",Sophie

I took 3 200mg Advil and it stopped the uterus contractions but it didn’t help the gas pain. Took a Phazyme afterwards to help with gas and I’ve never been in so much pain in my life.

29,Simethicone,Gas,10.0,,"March 5, 2013",117,"Gas-X (simethicone):For many years, I have not been able to eat out and hardly any restaurant.  In either 15 minutes or up to a few hours depending on where I ate, I would get extremely nauseous and have a diarrhea attack, this after I got extreme swelling in my stomach and belly.  I just discovered by accident that if when I took`Gas-X strips, I either did not get any symptoms or they were mild.  I have been able to add a few good restaurants to places I can eat, (when before it was only at home)  Eating at most fast food restaurants is still a no-no due to MSG and similars.   Taking them 20 min or so before eating produces the best results.  My son found similar results for himself.",Maggie's Mom
