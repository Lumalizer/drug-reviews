0,Reglan,Gastroparesis,10.0,Taken for 10 years or more,"October 15, 2021",0,"I have had Type 2 diabetes for over 35 years. Approximately 12 years ago, I was diagnosed with gastroparesis. My GI doctor prescribed Reglan 10 mg 3x daily and at bedtime if needed. Due to my caution about side effects, he gradually let me relax this regimen. I now skip the breakfast and lunch doses, as those are my small meals of the day. At times, if we're having a light dinner, I can also skip the evening dose. (There are also times when eating a large dinner, I use the evening and bedtime doses.) I have had no negative side effects from managing my gastroparesis in this way. It works for me, and allays my fears of side effects as well.",Spellerbee
1,Reglan,Gastroparesis,1.0,,"July 12, 2021",4,"I have been given this med several times in a GI cocktail at the ER when having belly pain from gastroparesis, undiagnosed. I began feeling afraid as it entered my system; a need to remove the IV and get the med out of my body. I felt I was going to die. I wanted to escape, but also felt like I couldn't move. The ER's in my area give medicine and not check back in for an hour +, so I suffered alone while texting my SO how scared I was. Later, getting diagnosis of gastroparesis, this was prescribed to me and began taking nightly. It caused the same reaction and I couldn't sleep for fear if I closed my eyes I wouldn't wake. I held onto my SO's arm saying ""I'm scared I will die if I fall asleep... please help..."" I then realized it was the same med in the GI cocktail and I told my dr I couldn't cope with the side effects. There are other treatments available. Nobody has to suffer this med if they have this reaction. I still get anxiety when going to ER due to the traumatic experiences.",Msk
2,Reglan,Gastroparesis,,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"April 19, 2021",10,"I have read all the reviews and they are terrifying to say the least but I suffer from gastroparesis and was put on this 3 x a day. I cut it back to basically only taking it whenever I start feeling ""funky"" (nausea, vomiting, etc.).  It works fine for me. No side effects. Just take it when I need it which, controlled with diet I may take 5mg Reglan 3x a week. Works great for gastroparesis patients.",Jayy85
3,Reglan,Gastroparesis,9.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"October 21, 2020",13,"I have gastroparesis due to what they think is Vegas nerve damage from funduplication in 2017, symptoms started 2 years later. I almost starved to death, it was the worst thing I've ever been through. Nothing they tried worked until Raglan. I was very scared to take it due to the stories I've heard, but It has saved my life!! It has helped me so much, I actually keep my food down and the horrible reflux is gone when taking Raglan. I'm so grateful for this medication. The only side effect I have experienced is vivid, sometimes bad dreams. I'll take the dreams over constant vomiting!",Dee
4,Reglan,Gastroparesis,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"May 19, 2020",23,Reglan along with zofran almost cured my nausea and allows me to eat! The Reglan is great because I can eat and not feel so nauseated I’m going to throw up half way through. Makes me feel as if I can work through full huge meals. For me those medications for Gastroparesis are 100/100,Mic

When I don’t take it my nausea is so bad I cannot eat. I cannot function without it. I have tried most common nausea meds, and it’s the only thing that helps!I’ve had developed the hand twitches from taking 10mg 3 times a day.

7,Reglan,Gastroparesis,1.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"January 19, 2020",11,"I live with a Type 1 diabetic who developed Gastroparesis 3 years ago. Our GI put him on Reglan, he was highly anxious, angry, suffered from restless leg and was still throwing up. On the Reglan he puked a lot or more and here's the kicker IT MADE HIM THROW UP after taking him off of the drug. The primary care we had explained how Reglan can only be used for short periods of time and although she took him off Reglan. Also, be aware that he was still gonna puke till he was weened off of it. The erythromycin he was given only gave him diarrhea, and was still puking. They need way more research for this because the 2 options you give to these people are garbage. He didn't want surgery but he is not gonna have a choice this disease can't be controlled yet and watching him suffer is out of the question.",JerseyBrookie
8,Reglan,Gastroparesis,10.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"January 15, 2020",18,"I was diagnosed with Gastroparesis back in May 2019 and was put on Erythromycin first. I still had early satiety, vomiting, severe nausea, and lack of appetite so my GI put me on Reglan. I take 5mg Reglan, 3x daily before meals and as needed for nausea & vomiting. I alternate Zofran, Phenergan, and Reglan constantly thru out the day so I can keep my nausea under control & vomiting to a minimum. I've been on Reglan for about 6 months and haven't been hospitalized for malnutrition, dehydration, vomiting or nausea since starting it. My GI hopes to eventually cut back on the amount of Reglan I take but so far, I've gained weight, can eat most days, and am able to keep food down. If you're struggling with Gastroparesis, I highly recommend Reglan. Oral & IV Reglan has saved my life & staved off any feeding tubes.",echitt
9,Reglan,Gastroparesis,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"December 10, 2019",17,"So to start I have Gastroparesis and wound up in the ER last week because of it and found out I’m pregnant. Because I’m pregnant they couldn’t give me the strong meds they usually do for my Gastroparesis and instead gave me Reglan. HUGE mistake!! Minutes after the administered it into my IV I felt anxious and jumpy like I was crawling out of my skin. I start screaming non stop like a psychopath and was hitting my self in the head and face over and over again uncontrollably. My husband had to sit behind me as restrain me to keep me from hurting myself. At one point he put his hand over my mouth to stop my loud screaming and I bit him. The doctor told me to just wait it out but after 30 minutes of going literally crazy they finally gave me some Benadryl. The Benadryl helped a lot and calmed me down, but I will NEVER take Reglan again and after reading all of the other stories on here I think it should just be banned.",Pinkie
10,Reglan,Gastroparesis,1.0,,"October 28, 2019",32,"I am a female in my mid 20's. I was given Reglan for issues related to previous abdominal surgery and gastroparesis. I only took it for about 2 days before I stopped. I felt extremely restless and couldn't stop sleeping but also was never comfortable enough to fully fall asleep. I also felt like I was in a psychotic episode that was never going to end. I was extremely irritated/agitated, very depressed and having suicidal thoughts, thought I needed to quit my job, and couldn't have a conversation with anyone. I know my doctor had no way of knowing how I would react to Reglan, and some people do well, but I think this is way too risky to be handing out.",Anonymous
11,Reglan,Gastroparesis,9.0,,"October 21, 2019",15,Im on reglan right now for gastropersis and its working great for my stomach. I am shaking alot more and have restlessness especially in my legs  also feeling a little more tense sometimes but its really helping with my stomach.

16,Reglan,Gastroparesis,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"June 26, 2019",9,"I was given reglan one time at the ER via IM injection. I was suffering from severe migraine headaches and nausea. Within 10 minutes I had become severely irritated, restless and would have rather have the severe migraine as opposed to the way the reglan made me feel? I told my GP that I'm allergic to reglan and to please never prescribe reglan to me ever. I also have and had MS when the ER Doctor ordered the IM injection. It is most definitely a drug I'm allergic to.",justjefff
17,Reglan,Gastroparesis,1.0,,"June 6, 2019",15,"Took it for diagnosed gastroparesis in 2012. I felt great for about 5 hours and then I had an allergic recation. For me that meant I felt burning ants under my skin as the muscles in my face and neck locked themselves into distorted positions. I spent hours staring at the ceiling because my neck was completely straight and locked, my eyes couldn't focus, and my face made all sorts of nonsense expressions making it hard to breathe. My mother said I went cross eyed. Of course I also started vomiting profusely.",Cat
18,Reglan,Gastroparesis,2.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"May 19, 2019",20,"I was diagnosed with SMA [Superior Mesenteric Artery Syndrome ] syndrome.  I had surgery to help correct it, but from years of being misdiagnosed because SMA is very rare in someone like me, my esophagus paid the price due to being obstructed for so many years.  I have very little motility.  My dr put me on Reglan following my surgery to aide with digestion. Shortly after taking it, I felt extreme fatigue.  As the days went on, my anxiety level increased. I have never been a person with anxiety, so this was rare for me.  I constantly had people asking me, ""What's wrong"".  My thoughts were racing all the time.  The only thing I could attribute it to was Reglan.  I told my doctor, and he said to discontinue use.  After a few days of being off the medication, I began to feel like myself again.  If it works for you great, but if you are experiencing any of the things I mentioned I would quit taking the medicine.",Leslie

Initially started to feel relief after the first few days, after 5 days I was able to keep food down and ceased to vomit for the first time in months.  By day 7 the Tardive Dyskinesia symptoms started with leg twitching, lip smacking, and neck immobility.  Thankful the Dr. had told me that Benedryll was the antidote and the symptoms went away after a day.  So annoyed that I experienced these side effects cause it WAS working for the gastroparesis, but not worth having a life long Tardive Dyskinesia.",marg

22,Reglan,Gastroparesis,8.0,,"January 31, 2018",15,"After zofran and phenergan stopped working I was given reglan 5mg for my gastroparesis. At first I was in love pretty much, I was able to eat things I haven't ate in years. I took it for about 4 weeks, I had terrible mood swings, stomach cramps, insomnia, and extreme fatigue. But I wasn't worried about it I was able to eat. I actually lost weight. Now all of a sudden it stopped working, I started getting severally bloated slowly then the nausea started. I wish it still worked. Even after my Dr upped my dose to 10mg it still stopped.",Shanny116

I am bipolar 2 and apparently it interacted with my psych meds. I was very agitated and angry to the point that I had to discontinue it.  18 months ago I was diagnosed Diabetic type 2 and now have gastroparesis. I need the Reglan bad!

24,Reglan,Gastroparesis,8.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"October 11, 2017",18,"For me Reglan was a blessing as it ended my nausea, pain, and vomiting caused by gastroparesis. I know that for some people it comes with severe side effects. I was put on it for long term use. After reading up on it, I learned that it is recommended to be used for no longer than 12 weeks as that is often long enough to control symptoms for the time without the risk of long term use. If symptoms reoccur a person can go back on it. This happened to me. I was off it and went back on it for a month and my symptoms again improved. Also, reading the reviews, I see that some of you have been diagnosed with gastroparesis by doctors suspecting it. There are tests that can give a definitive diagnosis so another problem is not missed.",haaackkj
25,Reglan,Gastroparesis,7.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"September 23, 2017",18,"This medication can be dangerous but it works REALLY well.I used it to treat stomach motility. I've been admitted in the ER many times during flare ups (severe nausea/vomiting/no sleeping/misery that would last for days) and as soon as I would get it through and IV, I would feel so good! So it's a miracle drug when it comes to treating nausea/vomiting. I took only 10mg, because of the warnings and only took it at night and if I needed it (if I ate something that would not digest) It worked really well to manage gastroparesis. I started to function, gain weight, eat food. Then after 6 months I woke up one day and my speech was slurred, and I was losing fine motor control, couldn't write or text, so I had to stop taking it.",IJCE307

It works wonders on moving food through my stomach! The only side effect I've had is tiredness after taking it, but it doesn't hit me all the time. When I take it before I eat I don't vomit or experience nausea. This is especially great since I love salad and I can't eat it without metoclopramide. Great drug! :-)",T1Dstrong

I could hardly focus my vision nonetheless my mind, and my muscles felt tense and restless, occasionally twitching. It was almost an anxiety level of antsy feelings that I sort of had to wait out.

30,Reglan,Gastroparesis,9.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"April 9, 2014",92,"This is a follow up to my earlier unfavorable review. I experienced several negative effects due to a excess of serotonin, caused by my concommittant use of several anti-depressants. My Dr. adjusted my dosage to only 1/2 of a 5mg. tablet taken a few hours after my evening dinner, and did not eat again until breakfast the next morning. This reduced my negative effects to almost zero, while still maintaining the medicines efficacy. I am able to continue this dose EVERY OTHER evening with VERY favorable results! There has been a considerable reduction in the severe bloating, nausea, and inability to eat even a small meal. I am thrilled to finally feel normal again! I'm so happy I stuck with it, a simple dose adjustment has changed my life!!",MRSDJMCW

I was diagnosed with gastroparesis and tried to control the symptoms through diet because I was worried about the potential side effects, but the nausea was debilitating.  My doctor finally didn't give me a choice, he said I needed to be on Reglan as I was losing too much weight because I couldn't eat.  I truly feel like a new person.  Although I still have ""spells"" where the nausea comes back, it's not nearly as severe and is controllable with Zofran.  I would recommend Reglan to anyone with gastroparesis!",gacsmom1

I had to change my eating habits dramatically, so when I messed up or when the nausea flared up Reglan was great. I did find, like many other patients, that the side effects (anxiety for me) got worse over time. After about a year I felt I had learned how to manage my diet and stopped taking Reglan entirely. Reglan was a great tool in the beginning to help me figure out what eating habits worked, but now I manage everything through diet. I think that is very possible for others with gastroparesis, too.

I was taking 40 mg of Nexium every day, but it got to a point where I never felt well anymore, I was constantly fatigued, I had no appetite, and I was becoming increasingly depressed. I was diagnosed with gastroparesis by my fifth doctor and she put me on Reglan. Within an hour of taking the first dose, I felt better than I had in years.

I know there is a threat to older women, but if I had not taken Reglan, I'd still be the vegetable that I was, living off of noodles and potatoes.
