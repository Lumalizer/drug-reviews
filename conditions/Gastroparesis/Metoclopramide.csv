0,Metoclopramide,Gastroparesis,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"February 7, 2022",0,I was prescribed this for Mild Oesophagel dysmotility. When I received the tablets it was mid-day and I was only able to take two tablets.  However later inthe same day I experienced  non-stop RLS with both legs.  My legs were constantly jerking all that evening and during the night.  In the morning I was back to normal.  The other two incidents which occured when I was sitting at my desk working when I fell asleep and was woken to find myself falling - thankfully I managed to save myself going any further by grabbing hold of the other end of the desk.   Then in the evening I was sitting at the table when I fell asleep and found myself once again falling off my chair.   After that I stopped taking the Metoclopramide - it was my decision as my doctor was away for a week.  What worried me was the fact that I might have the same experience whilst driving my car.,Stella

3,Metoclopramide,Gastroparesis,10.0,Taken for 10 years or more,"October 15, 2021",0,"Reglan (metoclopramide):I have had Type 2 diabetes for over 35 years. Approximately 12 years ago, I was diagnosed with gastroparesis. My GI doctor prescribed Reglan 10 mg 3x daily and at bedtime if needed. Due to my caution about side effects, he gradually let me relax this regimen. I now skip the breakfast and lunch doses, as those are my small meals of the day. At times, if we're having a light dinner, I can also skip the evening dose. (There are also times when eating a large dinner, I use the evening and bedtime doses.) I have had no negative side effects from managing my gastroparesis in this way. It works for me, and allays my fears of side effects as well.",Spellerbee
4,Metoclopramide,Gastroparesis,9.0,Taken for 5 to 10 years,"September 23, 2021",0,"After a HIDA scan showed that my gallbladder was a dud, it was removed. Soon after, the symptoms of delayed gastric emptying appeared. I had two rounds of tests and I was diagnosed with gastroparesis, probably triggered by my gallbladder removal but likely from having a genetic disorder, Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome. The GP was helped immensely by Reglan 5mg but I had to reduce my dosing as I developed a minor tic (nothing that really bothers me). I have awful insomnia from having EDS and have no chance of sleep unless I take 5 prescription medications. Many nights though, it was like I took nothing for sleep and I laid awake all night. I wondered if my GP was preventing my meds to pass from my stomach and be absorbed. Started taking one Reglan with my sleep meds and I now have the best sleep I’ve had in 15 years. EDS makes life very difficult but Reglan has helped me manage a couple of real troubling issues. My life would be very different without it.",DaniH

I began feeling afraid as it entered my system; a need to remove the IV and get the med out of my body. I felt I was going to die. I wanted to escape, but also felt like I couldn't move. The ER's in my area give medicine and not check back in for an hour +, so I suffered alone while texting my SO how scared I was. Later, getting diagnosis of gastroparesis, this was prescribed to me and began taking nightly. It caused the same reaction and I couldn't sleep for fear if I closed my eyes I wouldn't wake. I held onto my SO's arm saying ""I'm scared I will die if I fall asleep... please help..."" I then realized it was the same med in the GI cocktail and I told my dr I couldn't cope with the side effects. There are other treatments available. Nobody has to suffer this med if they have this reaction. I still get anxiety when going to ER due to the traumatic experiences.",Msk

BUT, the muscle twitching still persists. Including the most annoying one moving my neck/head. I have yet to visit a neurologist, but I fear these symptoms may be here to stay.

I alternate Zofran, Phenergan, and Reglan constantly thru out the day so I can keep my nausea under control & vomiting to a minimum.

My GI hopes to eventually cut back on the amount of Reglan I take but so far, I've gained weight, can eat most days, and am able to keep food down.

As soon as the drip started, I felt like I was going to die. I didn't feel like I was in my body and felt like I was burning from the inside. I wanted to go home and run away from the hospital. It was the weirdest feeling ever. I didn't realize that it was Reglan until I was prescribed it. The next day comes and I take 10 mg before breakfast. Everything is fine for a couple of minutes until I feel the same reaction again. I feel as if I'm about to go crazy and I'm not even in my own body. At this point, I'm realizing that it's the medicine causing it. If you feel this way, please go to the doctor ASAP. This medication is known to cause you to feel this way. Unlucky for me, I thought it was just me being odd so I didn't say anything at the ER, but I really should have. I'm going to see my doctor in a couple of days and I'm going to mention this to her.

Minutes after the administered it into my IV I felt anxious and jumpy like I was crawling out of my skin. I start screaming non stop like a psychopath and was hitting my self in the head and face over and over again uncontrollably. My husband had to sit behind me as restrain me to keep me from hurting myself. At one point he put his hand over my mouth to stop my loud screaming and I bit him. The doctor told me to just wait it out but after 30 minutes of going literally crazy they finally gave me some Benadryl.

I took this metoclopramide  for two weeks, 3 pills of 10mg a day. At the beginning everything was fine, the pain disappeared and I was feeling better. I was urinating a lot but well, at the end and after finishing the entire box the real problems started. When was nearing the end I  started to not want to engage in intercourse, and started to have erectile disfunction, then came the paranoia, the conflicting thoughts and anxiety, but what a brutal anxiety! Life just felt too hard, I felt completely dead inside and just had bad thoughts... right now in this moment I'm still not completely over it. Sometimes even I had involuntary movements of my limbs specialy at night. This created a big depression that made me feel like rubbish !

50,Metoclopramide,Gastroparesis,9.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"April 9, 2014",92,"Reglan (metoclopramide):This is a follow up to my earlier unfavorable review. I experienced several negative effects due to a excess of serotonin, caused by my concommittant use of several anti-depressants. My Dr. adjusted my dosage to only 1/2 of a 5mg. tablet taken a few hours after my evening dinner, and did not eat again until breakfast the next morning. This reduced my negative effects to almost zero, while still maintaining the medicines efficacy. I am able to continue this dose EVERY OTHER evening with VERY favorable results! There has been a considerable reduction in the severe bloating, nausea, and inability to eat even a small meal. I am thrilled to finally feel normal again! I'm so happy I stuck with it, a simple dose adjustment has changed my life!!",MRSDJMCW

52,Metoclopramide,Gastroparesis,10.0,,"June 6, 2013",110,"Reglan (metoclopramide):Reglan has been a miracle for me.  I was diagnosed with gastroparesis and tried to control the symptoms through diet because I was worried about the potential side effects, but the nausea was debilitating.  My doctor finally didn't give me a choice, he said I needed to be on Reglan as I was losing too much weight because I couldn't eat.  I truly feel like a new person.  Although I still have ""spells"" where the nausea comes back, it's not nearly as severe and is controllable with Zofran.  I would recommend Reglan to anyone with gastroparesis!",gacsmom1
53,Metoclopramide,Gastroparesis,5.0,,"February 9, 2013",21,"I have MS & GASTROESOPHAGEAL REFLUX DISEASE (GERD) and GASTROPARESIS and have been taking Metoclopramide 5 mg , 2/ a day for a year then they raised it to 5mg/4 times a day. Soon after they went up 10mg 4/ times a day. When i went to the 4 a day i started having problems. It started with a low grade fever and major confusion and then came the breathing troubles, plus some anxiety that got pretty bad. I could not catch my breath mainly at night. It got so bad I was even starting to panic. It may have caused other side effects but with MS they were hard to tell. I just stopped taking them and after the second night my breathing was a little better.I am hoping that goes away. ",Rickygs
54,Metoclopramide,Gastroparesis,8.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"September 27, 2012",86,"Reglan (metoclopramide):I found this medication extremely helpful when I was first diagnosed. I had to change my eating habits dramatically, so when I messed up or when the nausea flared up Reglan was great. I did find, like many other patients, that the side effects (anxiety for me) got worse over time. After about a year I felt I had learned how to manage my diet and stopped taking Reglan entirely. Reglan was a great tool in the beginning to help me figure out what eating habits worked, but now I manage everything through diet. I think that is very possible for others with gastroparesis, too.

It does seems to help with some of the gastroparesis symptoms but does not completely eliminate them. However my biggest concern is side effects it causes. After one month of use I noticed by breast becoming larger, painful, and lactating upon touch. (No I'm not a candidate for pregnancy!). I'm sure all medicines have their issues but the lactating definitely concerns me. I must add Metozolv is very costly.",emycunningham

I was told by four doctors that it was acid reflux and to learn to live with it. I was taking 40 mg of Nexium every day, but it got to a point where I never felt well anymore, I was constantly fatigued, I had no appetite, and I was becoming increasingly depressed. I was diagnosed with gastroparesis by my fifth doctor and she put me on Reglan. Within an hour of taking the first dose, I felt better than I had in years. I can't put into words how positively Reglan has changed my life. I've now been on it for a year and a half. I've never had any negative side effects nor has the effectiveness ever waned.

I was scared like the rest of you. But guess what? I'm still here and it's been about two weeks. It has helped me IMMENSELY. I'm pushing 29, so maybe I'm still in the ""safe zone."" I know there is a threat to older women, but if I had not taken Reglan, I'd still be the vegetable that I was, living off of noodles and potatoes. Thankfully, I have very close friends and family in the medical field and they assured me that the chances of the terrible side effects weren't as high as they may seem on the internet. It is a medicine prescribed daily and many people are pleased. (5mg 3x daily) Good luck!!",Anonymous

I have had NO side effects. I just feel so much better. I feel normal again and I know other people who take this medicine and they feel better also.
