1,Levofloxacin,Pneumonia,3.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"March 2, 2022",0,"Prescribed this for pneumonia, 1 pill x 5 days.  It cleared it right up.  However, I'm left with stomach issues, diarrhea, depression, excessive crying over the littlest thing (or nothing at all), sleep disruption, fatigue, occasional chest pains, memory issues, and general malaise.  Having it put into my medical records NEVER to give me this class of antibiotic again unless I have MRSA or been exposed to anthrax.  There were other antibiotics that don't have a black box from the FDA that I could have been prescribed instead.  I'm really unhappy that the side effects were not discussed with me beforehand.Giving it *some* points because the pneumonia did resolve (though it was likely viral rather than bacterial.)",Julles

Within 10 minutes, I started to become irritable, hot and started taking off my clothes because I felt hot on my hands and feet (tops & bottoms), I felt like the heat was coming in waves, crawling over me. I looked at myself and I looked sunburned, my throat started to tighten within another 5 minutes. My husband drove me to the ER, I had the window down and my head tilted up to try to breath better. I sounded like a child with awful croup. My body was shaking and the intake nurse didn't believe I was having an allergic reaction... She told me to calm down because I was ""hyperventilating"".... The Dr comes in, takes one look at me... Benedryl, IV and epinephrine & oxygen. Intake nurse says on the way out ""I guess you were having a reaction""....",Windsone
3,Levofloxacin,Pneumonia,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"December 28, 2021",0,"Levaquin (levofloxacin):Everyone in my family who took levaquin  had bad effects. But not me. I had double  bacterial pneumonia  &  chronic Bronchitis, I  took one 500 mg for 7 days. It healed me wonderfully & w/ zero side effects. I found out  later Levaquin is only to be used when a person has a bacterial infection, if there infection is mild or only viral  infection the drug is too strong &  can destroy tendons & other tissue and  can destroy soft tissue & joints etc. So warning only take Levaquin or any quolinoids if you have been diagnosed with Bacterial infection, & depending on how high the bacterial count is is how much you should take & for how long. My count was so high it would take 7 days @ 500 mg a day  to get rid of all the bacteria -  like clockwork on the 7th day after I took the last pill,  I was completely healed . Be very proactive in your health. Make sure you get the full measure of how much bacteria is in you before taking it",Anonymous

5,Levofloxacin,Pneumonia,1.0,,"July 2, 2021",1,I have pnuemonia still after a 7 day supply of 750 mg of levofloxacin.  This drug did nothing to help stop the pnuemonia. All it did was give me bad side effects. Muscle cramps and joint aches. Even lower abdominal pains. The rapid heart beats was the worse side effect. This drug may work for some folks but it did nothing for me. I give it a 0 on a cure for pnuemonia and a 10 rating for extreme side effects.,Hank

My chest felt like it was burning, and I had sharp pinching pain on my chest and throat. I’ve heard of being floxed and I feel like this was it. A week and a half later and I’m still suffering from these side effects. I’ve seen my pcp and urgent care for treatment.

I can’t do stairs at all. My muscles are so weak. I’m really scared to see how this goes down. It cured my pneumonia but I’m paying a heavy price for that cure.

20,Levofloxacin,Pneumonia,8.0,,"December 15, 2019",31,I promised myself I would write a detailed review once I finished the course of antibiotics for pneumonia. I tried Omnicef first which I was allergic to then I took a ZPack which wasn’t strong enough to knock it out of me so my dr prescribed me levoFLOXacin 750mg for 7 days. I’m am one of those people who read all the reviews and it scare me outta myself so this was no different. All the reviews had given me a massive panic attack after the first dose. Here’s my experience. I did have crazy insomnia I couldn’t sleep without 50mg of Benedryl I  had loss of appetite and very mild anxiety attacks but this all resolved after the medicine was finished. My dr told me I could stop after 5 days bc I was clear! I will say none of this side effects outweighs the benefits. In my experience if a medicine works for you then you prob won’t be on the internet reviewing it so 80% of these people had a bad experience no one tells you the good news is that it works and just listen to your dr and your body.,Erika

I had a lot of the symptoms the second time others have had: racing heartbeat, nervousness, anxiety, joint pain in wrist and up near elbow, Achilles heel pain and some pain around knee, leg twitching, low appetite.

105,Levofloxacin,Pneumonia,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"October 15, 2015",7,"This is a horrible antibiotic, please think twice before you fill this prescription. Very quickly after I took my first dose of Levoquin, my heart started racing. I was literally sweating all day, and could not sleep at all. Gave me horrible anxiety. The side effect lasted for a good 24 hours. When I told my doctor about it, he encouraged me to try it for one more day - and that maybe these side effects were due to a steroid I had taken a day before. I had my doubts but I took one more dose another day. Same exact side effects, more sweating, anxiety, heart palpitations. Couldn't sleep AGAIN. When I tried to take a Xanax to allow myself to sleep the result was really bad and caused even more anxiety. Switched to Augmentin.",Adrockian
