0,Clarithromycin,Pneumonia,10.0,,"July 2, 2021",0,This drug is great. My infection and breathing improved dramatically within 24 hours of taking this medication. My Dr prescribed 250mg twice per day. I have had no side effects except a mild metallic taste.  The people who are getting really bad reactions to this medication might be on the wrong dosage. Worth discussing this with your Dr.,inappropriateamy
1,Clarithromycin,Pneumonia,5.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"November 7, 2020",3,"I've been on clarithromycin a few times because I keep getting pneumonia every year. I was prescribed it again on Monday due to another vicious attack by pneumonia that had me off work and laid up for 10 days. The first night, I woke up with a super dry mouth and that disgusting metallic taste. It gradually got worse, to the point that it was like I was burping and coughing up the medication, it felt like it was sitting in my throat even though I had taken it with lots of water hours ago. I also experienced a debilitating headache Wednesday evening, probably the worse headache I've had. A couple days ago, I noticed a pain in my cheek, back by my wisdom teeth. I poked around in my mouth, didn't find any lumps or bumps, but my cheek is sore and it hurts to chew or yawn. I also seem to be experiencing some spells of dizziness. I really don't like clarithromycin, its side effects are less than ideal, but it gets rid of the pneumonia so I'll suffer through!",Kathleen
2,Clarithromycin,Pneumonia,2.0,,"April 19, 2020",4,"Where do I start with this antibiotic? Got diagnosed with pneumonia got put on amoxicillin, finished course breathing got worse. Then was prescribed all I can describe as this awful meds\ clarithromycin. EVIL things, strongly advise against these. First day on them felt ill and slept all day and night, from then on I just felt worse. Had a severely upset stomach, metallic taste that doesn’t go, headaches from hell and insomnia.Only positive is I’ve lost weight, apart from that I would not choose to be on these meds again.",Mj
3,Clarithromycin,Pneumonia,3.0,,"December 29, 2019",6,"This worked a treat for the pneumonia after doxycycline and amoxicillin had not helped at all. BUT 2 hours after the first dose I got a very odd feeling of looking down on my body and watching myself interact with others. I lay in a darkened room for a while it eased off. I felt that I had no choice but to continue with the medicine given my fear of the infection getting even worse. Happily although I felt a tiny bit odd after the second dose the strange depersonalisation feeling did not recur. Later I got strange metallic taste, lack of  appetite and headache but no more awful out of body/mind feelings.",Mook
4,Clarithromycin,Pneumonia,8.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"November 4, 2019",17,"I read the reviews on this site and was absolutely terrified of taking this drug. I had pneumonia and amoxicillin had no effect, so was prescribed clarithromycin. However, thank goodness as it was amazing. Within less then 12 hours my fever (of 39.5) had completely gone, and from then on no fever and almost back to normal! The only side effect was a bitter taste, which was strong and woke me up at night. However, I found that mixing rice milk and honey literally took the taste away! So I kept a cup of it next to my bed and if I woke up with the taste I just drank it! It was amazing. I wouldn't advise having cows milk in this case because it creates mucus, but any milk alternative and honey should work! Just wanted to let you know in case helpful! Wishing you better",Sash

8,Clarithromycin,Pneumonia,9.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"June 15, 2019",7,"I have 10 hours left until my 4th dose of Biaxin XL 500mg x2 tabs once per day.I finally feel like I’m back in the land of the living!  After nearly 2 weeks of feeling absolutely awful (running 102 temps, headaches, pneumonia and so fatigued and weak that I was sleeping 20 hrs a day), this has been a Godsend!  I was fortunate and have had very few side effects , just mild diarrhea for the first two days but that seems to have cleared up.I’ve had no nausea or metallic taste, but it may be because I was taking it at noon  everyday to make sure there would be enough food in my tummy so they didn’t go into an empty stomach.Still have a cough but it has gone from wet to dry.  No longer coughing up any gross stuff and my nasal discharge has changed colour working on getting close to clear.  First 2 days I felt like I’d been walloped after taking it , but that feeling has passed.  So far so good and I would recommend this medication if you have pneumonia.",Harley
9,Clarithromycin,Pneumonia,4.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"June 4, 2019",5,I'm on my 5th day of clarithromycin for pneumonia and I can't wait to finish it. I'm on 500mg twice daily. I have no drastic side effects but the dreadful taste it leaves in my mouth is overwhelming. It tastes like the sap out of a dandelion stem. It's very unpleasant and makes me feel sick. I'm diabetic but to mask the taste I've had to start sucking sweets to try and stop myself throwing the tablet back up. To be fair the drug is doing its job and it's making me better but it's a pity the manufacturers can't do something about the God awful taste,Millie

12,Clarithromycin,Pneumonia,5.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"October 31, 2018",11,"This drug has definitely helped to clear up my pneumomia, but not without some terrible side effects. Most of which, I didn't realize were common until I saw this thread!Day 1 hit me hard. Felt suddenly extremely unwell and tired. Nausea and no appetite. Sense of taste altered. Also, extremely anxious, night sweats, shakes, heart racing, difficulty sleeping. Every time I would almost fall asleep, I would snap back awake, heart sped up. Horrible taste in mouth. Had I realized it was the meds, I would have switched earlier! Have pressed through and am now on Day 5 of 7. I have slowly adjusted, each day have a little more energy.

Weird metallic and bitter taste in my mouth, dry mouth and lips even after drinking fluids, anxiety, fear, palpitations, weakness, very strong headaches, hallucinations, nightmares, sweating, fast heart rates. On the other hand I can breath again and the terrible back and chest pain are gone. If there is a future need for me to have antibiotics I would really avoid this one. Side effects are away too much to take when you already feel poor and weary.",Jackie
14,Clarithromycin,Pneumonia,9.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"October 8, 2018",5,"Went to the drs after picking up a bug on a long haul flight, which led to a bad chest infection. I was a total mess. How I walked to the drs I have no clue. Sat almost weeping in the waiting room, dribbling, coughing, choking. Dr checked me over and prescribed these glorious wonder pills. Felt absolutely dreadful (just from the infection/possible pneumonia) for three days. Lay in bed unable to move. But day three came and I could breathe again and even managed 3 hours at uni! The taste in my mouth in the morning is utterly appalling and feel nauseous half an hour after taking them for a bit but no other side effects. I still feel a bit rough, low energy and lingering cough and generally under the weather however I don't feel like I've been through ten rounds with Tyson and am drowning at the same time.

I had pretty severe pneumonia after flu complications, and seemed to be resistant to amoxicillin so was prescribed these. The dose concerned me as it was very high and twice the usual dosage. I found these tablets almost impossible to swallow and they made me retch and gag. After 2 doses I had severe stomach pains which only eased after a hot bath. The stomach pains continued every time I took a dose. After the full course I have a vile taste in my mouth that nothing seems to get rid of! I certainly feel better, but all food tastes like acid right now and the pain was annoying.",Ditsy

I didn't sleep for 6 nights, each time I was just dropping off to sleep my heart suddenly leapt & shook me awake. It was my third course of antibiotics after amoxicillin & Cefalexin didn't work. I had 3 different courses of antibiotics, 4 ECGs, blood tests including a D-dimer blood test as they thought I had a pulmonary embolism, 3 X-rays, steroid tablets, tablets for my heart, sleeping tablets, fluids as I was dehydrated & antihistamine tablets.The Clarithromycin DID get rid of the infection but I absolutely hated the side effects.
