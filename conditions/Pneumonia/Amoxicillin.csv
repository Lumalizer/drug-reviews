0,Amoxicillin,Pneumonia,8,,"December 11, 2015",25,"Amoxil (amoxicillin):I have bacterial pneumonia with 2 spots on my lungs after the flu. Not much nasal involvement. Bad headache, body ache, fever and chills. Deep dry cough. Started Levaguin  by IV at the ER but within an hour I got hives on mouth and neck and slightly itchy all over, then 3 bouts of projectile vomiting.  Then tried Clavimycin but developed hives  after 2 days. Both meds helped me feel better and headache & fever went away.  Now on amoxicillin-clav 875, twice a day. Symptoms are very slowly improving. Only a bit of loose stool. Probiotics and bland diet help.",TexasSickie
