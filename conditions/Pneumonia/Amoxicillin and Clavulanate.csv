1,Amoxicillin and Clavulanate,Pneumonia,5,,"April 29, 2021",3,Augmentin (amoxicillin / clavulanate):I had deep bronchitis or pneumonia. Took the medication from an online doctor. Showed great results right away for a week. (prescription: 2 tablets twice a day for 2 weeks). So I decided to go out for just an hour to the library and then I got chills followed by a high fever so I continued to take the medication but did not work so doctor suggested Azithromycin 6 pack I don't see much improvements in my fever by 2nd day. Taking these two medications now as my doctor wants me to complete it!,x34
2,Amoxicillin and Clavulanate,Pneumonia,1,,"August 28, 2020",1,"I tried to stick through amoxicillin with clavulanate to the end, I mean I really, really tried. After having seizures during a procedure I was on a ventilator for several days and developed a lung infection, so the hospital sent me home with Augmentin after I was cleared. Little did I know my woes had only begun, because this medication caused me some of the worst pain, diarrhea, and vomiting I had ever had. As the days dragged on it became more and more violent. I begged my follow up doctor for anything that would help because the usual methods were futile. She gave me some Zofran which I recognized as helping at the hospital for the post-anesthesia nausea so I was like ""score!"" My dudes, that didn't even help. It did keep me from vomiting but the nightmare of  Augmentin that wants to leave your body whether it be from one end or the other. Thankfully, I switched. Anyways, I dreamed of incinerating this vile medication until I finally settled on throwing it as hard as I could into the trash.",Yokay
3,Amoxicillin and Clavulanate,Pneumonia,10,Taken for less than 1 month,"April 1, 2020",8,"This drug amoxicillin/clav is very strong. It heals, and kills everything bad, in its path. I had a pimple on my face, during my treatment for pneumonia, and that cleared up in one day. The only thing is, is that taking yogurt with it is a must, otherwise, you will have diarrhea.",Sz
4,Amoxicillin and Clavulanate,Pneumonia,4,Taken for less than 1 month,"May 5, 2019",5,"I can't take this amoxicillin with clavulanate for the whole 10 days due to the side effects, even tho I think there has been some improvement in my sinus infection, I don't know if there is still water in my left lung or not. After 3 or 4 days of using it 2 x/day as prescribed and having liquid black diarrhea, the whole crotch area started to itch terribly. I thought about calling my doctor for a different prescription but decided to tough it out for the sake of my lung, and kept taking it for another day. The following day, I just could not make myself take it. Monday morning I'll be calling my doctor, to see if I can get something more compatible with me.",Jane
5,Amoxicillin and Clavulanate,Pneumonia,7,Taken for less than 1 month,"February 23, 2019",3,"Augmentin (amoxicillin / clavulanate):I caught a case of  syphilis that left me very miserable for over 2 weeks. I was a z pack and those never seem to help, then I was given doxycycline and that seemed to help a little but didn't quite do the trick.. then I was given this and so far it's helping.",Mouse
6,Amoxicillin and Clavulanate,Pneumonia,1,,"February 8, 2018",4,Augmentin (amoxicillin / clavulanate):It effectively put me in the hospital with c-dif a month after.  Could of died.  Not happy with this drug.  As it killed every bacteria and the good bacteria too.,Antown
7,Amoxicillin and Clavulanate,Pneumonia,6,Taken for less than 1 month,"January 13, 2017",4,"It was alright, but truthfully I used apple cider vinegar and rubbing alcohol to cure my ear infection at least 3/4 times faster than this med did. Tummy issues with this and it took forever to kick in...unless it was just my natural hippy dippy remedy",JillTheRipper
8,Amoxicillin and Clavulanate,Pneumonia,1,,"December 6, 2016",11,"Augmentin (amoxicillin / clavulanate):I always get bronchitis in February.  Last February was no exception but it actually went into pneumonia very quickly.  Probably had something to do with fact I was moving that week...Worked too hard and got no rest. Had no choice, went to Urgent care and as I said I get bronchitis every yr.  Always take Z-pack, good cough syrup and an atomizer and rest and get well.  This time they gave me Augmentin.  875 mg. twice a day for 10 days and Steriod round and cough medication. Long story short ended up in ER with Jaundice. and weakness that was indescribable. Spent a wk. in hospital pushing fluids as this was a rare reaction to the Augmentin.  Very scary drug. Tested me for everything.  Dr was convinced that it was a reaction to the Augmentin.",Millie 7
9,Amoxicillin and Clavulanate,Pneumonia,9,,"November 16, 2013",51,"Augmentin (amoxicillin / clavulanate):Diagnosed with bronchial pneumonia two days ago. Had a fever of 102 at that point. Within two days, I don't have a fever. I am beginning to cough up the infection where I struggled before. I have to be open and add that I was also given prednisone to take. Between the two, at the end of the second day, I am beginning to feel better. Still a ways off but I feel a difference.",Crickettandweez
10,Amoxicillin and Clavulanate,Pneumonia,8,,"May 20, 2008",121,"Augmentin (amoxicillin / clavulanate):This worked wonders on my pneumonia.  I had pneumonia for 9 days, started Augmentin, and felt great after 3 more days.",Mike Smedley
