1,Levaquin,Pneumonia,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"February 25, 2022",1,"500mg prescription, I took a 1/2 a pill because I was cautious... Within 10 minutes, I started to become irritable, hot and started taking off my clothes because I felt hot on my hands and feet (tops & bottoms), I felt like the heat was coming in waves, crawling over me. I looked at myself and I looked sunburned, my throat started to tighten within another 5 minutes. My husband drove me to the ER, I had the window down and my head tilted up to try to breath better. I sounded like a child with awful croup. My body was shaking and the intake nurse didn't believe I was having an allergic reaction... She told me to calm down because I was ""hyperventilating"".... The Dr comes in, takes one look at me... Benedryl, IV and epinephrine & oxygen. Intake nurse says on the way out ""I guess you were having a reaction""....",Windsone
2,Levaquin,Pneumonia,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"December 28, 2021",0,"Everyone in my family who took levaquin  had bad effects. But not me. I had double  bacterial pneumonia  &  chronic Bronchitis, I  took one 500 mg for 7 days. It healed me wonderfully & w/ zero side effects. I found out  later Levaquin is only to be used when a person has a bacterial infection, if there infection is mild or only viral  infection the drug is too strong &  can destroy tendons & other tissue and  can destroy soft tissue & joints etc. So warning only take Levaquin or any quolinoids if you have been diagnosed with Bacterial infection, & depending on how high the bacterial count is is how much you should take & for how long. My count was so high it would take 7 days @ 500 mg a day  to get rid of all the bacteria -  like clockwork on the 7th day after I took the last pill,  I was completely healed . Be very proactive in your health. Make sure you get the full measure of how much bacteria is in you before taking it",Anonymous

The first time I went to the doctor with fever and chills, chest X-ray and labs revealed pneumonia and a kidney infection. I was getting close to being septic.

I'm highly alergic to almost all antibiotic's so this is kind of my last option. I had 50% fluidization in my left lung so it was treat the pneumonia or die. I have taken one does and my fever has gone from 103.7 to 101.4 and I'm already coughing up fluids. So while the side affects are scary if you get them (I haven't) it works very well.,mwhitson625

14,Levaquin,Pneumonia,,Taken for less than 1 month,"April 24, 2018",21,I have read all the bad reviews and I can honestly say this is a miracle drug.  My only problem has been the inability to sleep....and believe me when you are sick with pneumonia you want to sleep.  I end up probably taking too much melatonin and nighttime over the counter pills that helped with the sleep.  I really wish I could take a much needed nap.

I've never had anxiety issues or insomnia in my life, but from the moment I started it began. What kept me going with this was I know I needed it to clear up my infection, from the 2nd day on my coughing and phlegm is at a bare minimum. So while it's working it's dealing with being amped up so to speak. The doc also has me on Prenisone 10mg x2 a day which just increases the feelings that I've dealt with.

18,Levaquin,Pneumonia,9.0,,"January 29, 2018",20,"Let me start by saying when I was prescribed this med the reviews on here scared the stuffing out of me. I had been on other antibiotics for pneumonia for about a week and they did nothing. Dr wanted something stronger and gave me rx for Levaquin..plus oral steroids and inhaler. The only side effect I noticed was it was hard to sleep. (restless/jumpy)  this could have been from the steroids also. I had no nausea or dizziness. No joint pain  etc that a lot of the reviewers have noted. I did expect to feel better sooner rather than later with this strong antibiotic, however it did take the full 10 days and a few more to really start feeling better. I was happy with the outcome (and not needing to be in the hospital). I would not hesitate to take this medicine again. I had a clear chest xray on the 10th day. Levaquin did its job.",twinmom93

Never had any tendon issues or soreness although I have heard of the risk.  At this point, I'd rather take tendon issues than be in a hospital fighting pneumonia with whatever meds and high hospital bills.  I attribute a better reaction to it, however, to being fit and eating clean.  You can't blame a reaction solely on a particular medication.  There are so many other variables.",TeacherRia

When I wasn't better, the Dr. prescribed Levaquin. The first day was ok, just really tired. The second day I started having joint pain & my ribs were really hurting (not from coughing)& still really exhausted. By the third day I could barely walk because of my knees being so swollen & painful & hard to breathe because of the rib pain. Called the Dr. & he said to get off of it & come in for blood tests. I have been off of it for almost 2 weeks & still can barely walk & the ribs are still really sore.

64,Levaquin,Pneumonia,10.0,,"January 25, 2011",158,I am in the medical field and this is by far the best antibiotic you can get outside of the hospital. If you have a bacterial infection in your lungs and you want it to clear up right away then this is the medicine for you. On the downside it is a very expensive but at some point you get tired of being sick and realize it is worth every single penny. You will be well in no time!,Anonymous

73,Levaquin,Pneumonia,9.0,,"April 15, 2009",80,"I've been given this medicine twice - once for serious bronchitis/pneumonia that nearly required hospitialization. Since I am a well trained athlete, hospitalization for a lung infection was serious.  Doctors tried several other drugs before the Levaquin, but Levaquin was best.  Now dealing with a relatively minor bronchitis and have it again.  I've never had any of the side effects others listed - bear in mind that weakness and headaches and many other symptoms might just be the progression of the disease and not due to the drug. It's hard to tell since each bout is different but compared to many other drugs, this is statistically a very good bet.  If you have bronchitis or a respiratory infection, take your medicines with lots of fluids.",Anonymous
