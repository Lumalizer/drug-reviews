0,Augmentin,Pneumonia,5,,"April 29, 2021",3,I had deep bronchitis or pneumonia. Took the medication from an online doctor. Showed great results right away for a week. (prescription: 2 tablets twice a day for 2 weeks). So I decided to go out for just an hour to the library and then I got chills followed by a high fever so I continued to take the medication but did not work so doctor suggested Azithromycin 6 pack I don't see much improvements in my fever by 2nd day. Taking these two medications now as my doctor wants me to complete it!,x34
1,Augmentin,Pneumonia,7,Taken for less than 1 month,"February 23, 2019",3,"I caught a case of  syphilis that left me very miserable for over 2 weeks. I was a z pack and those never seem to help, then I was given doxycycline and that seemed to help a little but didn't quite do the trick.. then I was given this and so far it's helping.",Mouse

3,Augmentin,Pneumonia,1,,"December 6, 2016",11,"I always get bronchitis in February.  Last February was no exception but it actually went into pneumonia very quickly.  Probably had something to do with fact I was moving that week...Worked too hard and got no rest. Had no choice, went to Urgent care and as I said I get bronchitis every yr.  Always take Z-pack, good cough syrup and an atomizer and rest and get well.  This time they gave me Augmentin.  875 mg. twice a day for 10 days and Steriod round and cough medication. Long story short ended up in ER with Jaundice. and weakness that was indescribable. Spent a wk. in hospital pushing fluids as this was a rare reaction to the Augmentin.  Very scary drug. Tested me for everything.  Dr was convinced that it was a reaction to the Augmentin.",Millie 7
4,Augmentin,Pneumonia,9,,"November 16, 2013",51,"Diagnosed with bronchial pneumonia two days ago. Had a fever of 102 at that point. Within two days, I don't have a fever. I am beginning to cough up the infection where I struggled before. I have to be open and add that I was also given prednisone to take. Between the two, at the end of the second day, I am beginning to feel better. Still a ways off but I feel a difference.",Crickettandweez
