0,Cefuroxime,Pneumonia,9.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"February 28, 2022",0,I am a partially-disabled 70 yr old woman with lung issues. I use to be on oxygen but off for a few years. I got pneumonia Jan '22 but think I had it since Dec '21. The Urgent Care DR prescribed  Cefuroxime. I have a lot of allergies.  I used it for the 10 days & it really helped with no side effects!  I did have to get refill a week later but that is due to previous lung issue.. . It really worked with no side effects. I am so glad!  I would recommend this drug as safe & effective.,Phoenix & 70
1,Cefuroxime,Pneumonia,9.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"February 25, 2022",1,"Ceftin (cefuroxime):I developed pneumonia from COVID and a sinus infection after I was COVID negative, still with lingering pneumonia. I was given Levaquin and it seemed to be working. But I developed a severe reaction to it, insomnia, shaking, panic attacks, nightmares, dizziness, and felt like I was having a mental breakdown. I told my doctor I need to get off Levaquin and why, and he prescribed a 10-day course of Ceftin. After two days being off Levaquin and now taking Ceftin, no more anxiety, insomnia, nightmares, dizziness, etc, Sinuses seem better. and less coughing. No diarrhea yet at two days in. Will go for CT scan in 18 days to see if chest is cleared from pneumonia, as they saw small pleural effusion on lower left lung, even after being on Levaquin for 15 days.It  could be COVID scarring, which might take longer to go away. Who knows.",BibleWay55
2,Cefuroxime,Pneumonia,9.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"October 14, 2021",1,After having Covid pneumonia for quite a while my first antibiotic was not doing the trick so my doctor prescribe me 1000 mg of this per day for 10 days. I went from feeling like I could be hospitalized to feeling significantly better a few hours after starting this antibiotic. It did cause some diarrhea but well worth it.,Cefuroxime
3,Cefuroxime,Pneumonia,10.0,,"July 28, 2020",3,"My husband was prescribed this cefuroxime along with a zpack for pneumonia. It's been 4 days & he's completely recovered.  He still has 1 dose of azythromycin & 3 and a half days of cefuroxime axetil to complete the course.  One or both of these drugs worked miracles for him with absolutely no side effects.Also, his bowel movements are normal. Everyone's tolerance is different. I would rate both drugs as a 10.",Lottie
4,Cefuroxime,Pneumonia,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"December 21, 2018",7,"My family Doctor prescribed Auro-Cefuroxime 500mg 2x a day for 10 days. I've never gotten sick taking antibiotics but the first pill I've taken made me vomit 4 hours later, I ate a decent meal when I took it too. I often have acid reflux though, this made it 10x worse. Pneumonia in both lungs and an ear infection. I'm going to try one more in the morning and see how it goes. I'm very sick as it is, I can't be sick to my stomach for 10 days.",Johnny Bravo
5,Cefuroxime,Pneumonia,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"May 1, 2018",9,"Doxycycline helped with severe case of pneumonia but was not knocking it out and fever continued.  My doc added cefuroxime and there was a change for the better right away.  I am allergic to aspirin, ibuprofen, sulfas, levaquin, amoxicillin, and the penicillins, but I had no problems with either of these meds as long as at least ate a slice of bread with them, and the cocktail cured me!",Mimi
6,Cefuroxime,Pneumonia,,,"March 26, 2018",6,"Ceftin (cefuroxime):I found the tablet form difficult to swallow. On my second dose, the tablet got stuck in my throat. Scary. But I managed to get it back out, and tossed it in the trash. Then I realized I would be one dose short.So I retrieved the tablet, only to discover that by now, it had swollen into a spongy mass. So I dropped it into a glass of water. Extremely bitter this way. And with irritated throat tissues.So, next dose, I put almond milk in my mouth, maybe 4 ounces, and tossed in the tablet and quickly swallowed. This time, it went down ok.I think the tablet needs a coating. I was thinking of using butter. I will try this on my next dose.",Tom
7,Cefuroxime,Pneumonia,5.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"March 16, 2018",0,"I was diagnosed with pneumonia 7 days ago the doctor prescribed me this. Everything seems to be ok until my day, 6  when I started experiencing severe abdominal pain I could walk straight. Just 3 more days left and I'm done with it",Vany
8,Cefuroxime,Pneumonia,1.0,,"December 23, 2015",9,"Ceftin (cefuroxime):My mother, age 75 took this. After 4 days she became very confused, bad chest pain, nauseated, felt jerky and diarrhea. She still shows some confusion after being off of it for 2 days.",Anonymous
9,Cefuroxime,Pneumonia,9.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"May 29, 2013",35,Ceftin (cefuroxime):Works and you start feeling better in 2-3 days but you get diarrhea. My doctor prescribed probiotics Florastor..that helped restore good bacteria.,Annie145
10,Cefuroxime,Pneumonia,1.0,,"November 9, 2012",14,"After 1-day noticed my lips burning, thought it was just chapped lips bought a tube of lip balm. On day 2 noticed tiny blisters forming on my bottom lip, and by the end of the day my bottom lip was beginning to swell. I quit using the lip balm but my lips continue to swell and burn. I developed a terribly deep but empty cough which I did not have before starting this prescription. This cough occurs while at rest, not while talking, eating, or exercising. Also soaking night sweats mainly from my head.  I did not read the side effects on the prescription.",Anonymous
11,Cefuroxime,Pneumonia,10.0,,"January 2, 2012",80,"Ceftin (cefuroxime):I was prescribed this after 3 days on a Azithromycin was making me worse. My doctor told me the Z-pack wasn't working because my bronchitis had become pneumonia. After 2 days on the Ceftin (250 mg, twice daily), I was really starting to improve. My cough had lessened, chest congestion had loosened nicely and my headache/stuffiness had started to subside. I also used a humidifier.Now, 4 days in and I'm feeling almost human. The cough is almost gone, I can breathe almost normally and am much improved. I have always heard the Z-pack knocks out almost everything, but I'm proof it's not a cure-all.One thing to note is that Ceftin can be rough on your stomach, so be sure to take it with food. Crackers, toast or yogurt should be fine.",Anonymous
12,Cefuroxime,Pneumonia,,,"November 1, 2009",8,The 500 mg uncoated tablet is large and very difficult to swallow.  Nasty taste!  Wish it came in a slippery capsule.  Since I just started with this medicine I don't know whether it will knock out the pneumonia which followed my H1N1 swine flu infection.,Anonymous
13,Cefuroxime,Pneumonia,8.0,,"September 20, 2009",46,"Ceftin (cefuroxime):Took pneumonia away quickly, however, it does cause diarrhea. I'm on my 6th day of a 14 day regimen. Works well and fast.",StanS
