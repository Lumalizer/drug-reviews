0,Zyvox,Pneumonia,10,,"October 10, 2008",43,"In February 2008 I fell ill to Influenza A and ended up with double pneumonia. After a 7 day hospital stay in the ICU I begged to go home and the doctor prescribed Zyvox. This antibiotic did its job and cleared up my pneumonia and also a MRSA sinus infection that I had tried dozens of other antibiotics for with no results. There weren't many annoying side effects which was a welcome relief. I did have some dizziness but nothing severe, also a little nausea from time to time.",alize73
