I normally have side effects of severe nausea, burning stomach pains, extreme fatigue .   I was very Ill when I started it and within 3 days I could feel it working.  I am on day 4 now of it and I the difference I feel comparing to the first day is colossal.  I would recommend this drug as very impressed with it",Sarah
1,Doxycycline,Pneumonia,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"July 7, 2021",2,"Went to the ER 11 days ago, because of extreme weakness and shortness of breath. After a CT scan with contrast they told me I had pneumonia in both lungs. I thought great they can get this cleared up. My prescription was Doxycycline Hyclate 100 mg twice daily. During the day I had no problems taking it, I haven’t slept more than an hour to a hour and a half, straight for the last 10 nights. After 10 days I still have shortness of breath, my oxygen is only 86-90 on a pulse oximeter and still run a fever of over 101. Not sure what my options are now.",Chuck

3,Doxycycline,Pneumonia,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"January 26, 2021",3,I was prescribed doxy for pneumonia and it has been 3 days and I'm starting to feel a lot better already. The only symptoms I've experienced is fatigue and a mild headache which I'm not sure is related to the doxy. Although I do get a little tired about 30 minutes after my doses and this lasts for the first 3-4 days it really does help so well. Symptoms are similar to the antibiotic keflex which is very tolerable  but I've never had an upset stomach or nausea. I usually eat a little before taking my medication. It's advised not to eat foods with calcium/milk and to be sure and drink with at least 8 ounces of water. It works well for me! :),Anonymous
4,Doxycycline,Pneumonia,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"January 2, 2021",2,"I am on my first day of using doxycycline and after the second dosage I started to feel the improvement of my bacterial pneumonia. Please, eat before taking the medication. Yes it will make you nauseous, yes it will give you headaches, the cons of taking a strong antibiotic. Drink a full glass (8oz) of water when you take it. Avoid dairy foods for about 3-4 after taking it. Also take a probiotic 4 hours later taking the doxy, you don't want it to kill off the good bacteria you have. And a MUST, FINISH THE COURSE. You can't expect it to work wonders right away.",Irms

The side effects using this with antibiotic and predizone are still effecting me. Increased heart rate, palpitations, shortness of breathe, anxiety attacks randomly (I don’t have anxiety) depression bouts where I feel sad, pressure in my head and bloating and burping.

On the first day when I took it on an empty stomach I felt fine but as the next few days went by I had some intense nausea, a mean headache, severe stomach pain and I even vomited water back up along with mucus. I mean it works but I mean with some of the side effects it makes you wonder is it really worth taking this specific medicine. I would seriously recommend eating when you take this medicine.",CharmingLady

11,Doxycycline,Pneumonia,8.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"March 19, 2020",20,"I started a 10 day round of this antibiotic  doxycycline for walking pneumonia. I am on day 7. Things to note: DO NOT TAKE ON AN EMPTY STOMACH....you will feel like it is the end of your life. I have tried every way possible to keep the nausea away and the best thing I have found is eating before you take it. Be sure to drink a full glass of water with it (8 oz should suffice) and then maybe finish whatever you were eating. The nausea will still come or in my case it did. You can have some sweats with this med too and it does make you feel crappy. No way around it. My repeat chest x-ray was this morning. I have no clue what the results are yet but I am also doing an emergency pro air albuterol inhaler at night and I did a 6 day round of prednisone. Again, and I can not stress this enough be sure to eat prior to taking. I am hopeful this med is doing its job clearing the pneumonia. I do feel better a little each day since beginning it.",Pottsy

Started doxy 2 x day, also using nebulizer with albuterol solution 3 x day and emergency albuterol inhaler for night time breathing help.  Better on day 3 but no further improvement until I began doxy 3 x day,  Always eat 30 minutes before taking doxy or you will have stomach issues.  Drink a bottle of water every two hours to help flush the crud out of your system.  You will be tired for at 8-10 days after stopping doxy, but it has done its job.",busymom

Pneumonia diagnosis. Was given doxycycline 100 mg x2 daily for 7 days. I'm on day two and already lungs are clear. Second day had a little stomach upset but I'd not drink much water that time. That is the key...drink water, drink water and drink water. Other than that one instance, no stomach trouble at all. It's a strong antibiotic and it works great, so glad I wasn't given amoxicillin which always tears my stomach up and works nowhere near as good as this has so far. Fist time using it and I'm thoroughly impressed so far. Tough out the stomach issues if you have any, again drink that water, cannot stress enough, not only for this drug but for helping the body to expel the mucous.

I'm now on day 3 of the Doxycycline and finally feel like I'm turning the corner to wellness. I've had no side effects from the Doxycycline and tolerated well. -I always finish the full course of antibiotics. I do not expect to fully recover after 2 days. -I avoid stomach upset and take med with a meal or small snack, unless otherwise instructed. -I am aware of medicinal interactions. I always check with my doctor to make sure another med I am currently prescribed will not interact adversely. -I am cautious if I have a history of antibiotic sensitivity. -I use common sense while ill and on an antibiotic.
