0,Cefdinir,Pneumonia,1,Taken for less than 1 month,"March 7, 2020",2,"Nothing. 12 days in and 7 on this medication and getting worse. Other symptoms reduced such as the headache, so I think it helped with that and sinitus that was related, but would never recommend for pneumonia. Switching to Amoxicillin as the next step.",Dee

3,Cefdinir,Pneumonia,9,Taken for less than 1 month,"June 7, 2019",14,"I was prescribed the cefdinir antibiotic to treat pneumonia. Day 5 and no serious side effects whatsoever.

4,Cefdinir,Pneumonia,10,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"April 21, 2019",5,"I was diagnosed with a rare hereditary disease PI, (Primary Immunodeficiency Disease).  Mine type is called Hypogammagobilema. The Immunologist I see prefers  this antibiotic as a back up because of it's effectiveness and very low probability for side effects. I have been taking it since November of 2018. I also have to take a IGG drug that gives my body the ability to actually fight the many different bacteria's that cause all types of Pneumonia, most that are very deadly. This antibiotic works well.",Bonerock
5,Cefdinir,Pneumonia,7,,"February 7, 2019",23,"I was prescribed this medication for bacterial pneumonia in my left lung, 2x per day for 10 days.  I have to say the reviews of this antibiotic are quite scary. I am extremely sensitive to medications of any kind and I have had very minimal side effects with this medication. I am currently on day 7 of my prescription, and aside from a little stomach upset here and and there, I have really had no other issues.  My facial skin has been drier, more irritated and a bit more blotchy than usual, which I guess I attribute to this prescription because nothing else in my day to day life has changed.  It took about 3-4 days to notice the medication helping to any degree. Pneumonia does take time to heal, so I didn't expect a miracle from this drug.  It had helped clear the infection with very minimal side effects.  Don't let the dramatic reviews scare you as I did.",helerown
6,Cefdinir,Pneumonia,9,Taken for less than 1 month,"December 23, 2018",12,"I’ve had an 11 month cough that evolved from mild at night to moderate day & night to severe day & night regurgitating clear mucus through my mouth & runny nose. I’ve seen 2 ENT’s, Pulmonologist, Gastrointestinal doc, Allergist & treated in ED for Acute Coughing Spasms. PPI’s, inhalers, Prednisone,  Allergy Meds & 2 other antibiotics temporarily stopped it or didn’t help. Many tests given.Finally one week ago immunologist did blood tests which show low Pneumococcal 23 results. He RX’d Cefdinir and after 48-72 hours I feel a big difference. Doc said he feels I have a bacterial infection and wants me to take it for 20 days.",chicagopd
7,Cefdinir,Pneumonia,1,Taken for less than 1 month,"September 20, 2018",5,"Prescribed Cefdinir for my first bout with pneumonia at age 47.  It did absolutely nothing and I nearly ended up hospitalized.  I begged for an alternative knowing I would end up as an inpatient, by this time a fractured rib and torn intercostal muscles were causing significant issue. I was prescribed Levofloxacin and it worked well.   Cefdinir didn't kill the bugs that I had.",Jason
