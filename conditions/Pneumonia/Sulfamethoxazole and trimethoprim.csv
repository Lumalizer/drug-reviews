0,Sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim,Pneumonia,3,Taken for less than 1 month,"March 30, 2022",0,"I was prescribed this for pneumonia for a 2 pills a day x 10 day regimen. I thought I was going crazy, and I have never had antibiotics effect me in this way. I am incredibly anxious, very lethargic and depressed, I couldn’t drive from the infection and then from the drugs. They definitely affect your appetite and cause a continuous low-grade fever. It is now day 6 and I think the infection is better, but I would never take these again unless necessary. It’s not fun to have a drug that is supposed to help affect other aspects of your life like not constantly being on the verge of an anxiety attack 24/7 or wanting to scream. If the benefits outweigh the side effects then go for it, otherwise stay clear please!!",Bactrim
