0,Azithromycin,Pneumonia,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"August 29, 2021",0,"I took the z pack for sinus, pneumonia.  The first 1st day I took 2 pills, on the 2nd day I had diarrhea and I continued to take it though minor side effects. The diarrhea continued with probiotics , BRAT diet the 5th day the last pill my heart raced 140 BP 140s over 90s.  The  diarrhea sent me to the ER 3x checking for C diff and getting rehydrated, it also flared my diverticulitis so I had to take immodium.  My heart continued to race I do not have cardiac problems and the EKGs were normal. It has been 20 days since the last dose and I am feeling better. Less anxiety, my diverticulitis  calmed down. This is not an amazing drug it causes more problems than it fixes. I think it should only be administrated in a inpatient setting with IV fluids and monitored for side effects and a lower strength. I will never take this medication ever if I need an antibiotic I  will demand Inpatient setting. Don't take this medication pure poison",Anonymous
1,Azithromycin,Pneumonia,3.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"December 26, 2020",8,"So far, not impressed.  Just finished my dosing for 5 days, with little  discernible difference in my condition (Pneumonia and COVID).  If I am generous, I'd say I have improved 10%.  Still feels like I have a python wrapped round my chest.  Very painful to take even small breaths.  Worst part has been the cough.  Fever continues to come and go.I have been prescribed this medicine in the past for strep throat, and after one day it was a HUGE improvement.  This time around, it does not seem too have much of an impact on my pneumonia. :-(",T.
2,Azithromycin,Pneumonia,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"July 25, 2020",15,My husband was diagnosed with pneumonia less than 24 hrs ago. He has taken his first azithromycin dose of 2. In less than 24 hours he is about 95% better. It seems to be working miracles with him,Lottie
3,Azithromycin,Pneumonia,8.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"June 15, 2020",50,I was prescribed azithromycin for a Covid19 scare. I had pneumonia but a negative Covid19 test. I was on a 5 day course. I’m someone who never takes medication because I’m scared of all the side effects and I’m an absolute baby when I feel bad.. at all. I took it before bed. I didn’t have many symptoms. I would have to use the bathroom in the middle of the night. The only thing that really bothered me was that it made me extremely cold. The 2 side effects I did experience were gone about 6 hours in. My symptoms from my pneumonia were gone by the second day on the medication. This was the first antibiotic where I was able to finish the full course (although I figured this would be better than having Covid and getting worse). I will also add that I have a heart arrhythmia called SVT. I also have inappropriate sinus tachycardia & POTS. The medication didn’t effect my heart at all. I was very scared of that.,Cheyenne

5,Azithromycin,Pneumonia,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"May 2, 2020",21,"Diagnosed with pneumonia, had no real cough, just very tired and a little short of breath sometimes. I took the first dose, terrified after reading all the stuff in here, but manned up and took it. I started to cough stuff up out of my lungs within a couple of hours. It did cause a rapid heart rate, that kind of freaked me out, but still coughing up and clearing those lungs out. I am hoping to be 100% soon.",Hockeyplayer28
6,Azithromycin,Pneumonia,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"April 7, 2020",46,"Z-Pak (azithromycin):Went to the hospital because of fever over a week and pain above my navel. They x rayed my chest and told me I have double pneumonia and most likely COVID-19. I have finished the entire z pack  (azithromycin) now and feel worse everyday. Doctors ignore my complaints. Diarrhea, fever, dizziness, chills, and the worst pain in my chest I have ever had even when not breathing deeply. However they still won’t test me for the virus. I don’t have any more meds and my doctor said not to come in for a follow up because I could get others sick. I am in mandatory quarantine with my family. I hope I don't die.",Covid 19 maybe

8,Azithromycin,Pneumonia,8.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"October 4, 2019",18,"After feeling lousy for months, I had a very bad pain that made me go to the ER!  Because of the pain and location, I was given x-rays and found no broken ribs.  There was a ""spot"" on my lung and I was given an anti-inflammatory along with pain med via IV.  Before leaving I was given 500 mg of Azithromycin and 2 days later I feel better than I have in months!  Guess I had walking pneumonia and praise the ER dr. for knowing what to prescribe (regular antibiotics and penicillin will not touch this), I was sent home and told to have a repeat x-ray in 4 days!  Never had any side effects from this med (guess I was given the child's dosage because of my weight) so that may be why I had no side effects!Needless to say, I have nothing but good things to say about this drug and my drs!",daisy

10,Azithromycin,Pneumonia,6.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"August 19, 2019",13,"Had pneumonia in February and suffered through it because I knew doctor would not listen, as usual. Survived but retained a cough for 6 months. Finally broke down and saw doctor, who tried to pawn off cough on acid reflux. Went to emergency room a week later and x-rays showed pneumonia never fully left. Was prescribed azithromycin. Like 99% of patients on this,  I had diarrhea immediately following. (Don't assume you're just passing gas!) Loose stools the next couple of days and fuzzy head off and on. Cough decreased in frequency if not intensity. Today's the last day. Diarrhea aside, I did feel better while taking it but whether it got rid of pneumonia is another question.",Poor man
11,Azithromycin,Pneumonia,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"January 5, 2019",15,"I was skeptical taking the Z-Pak to aid with Pneumonia as I have taken it for other ailments such as strep throat. Day three I started feeling much better. The side affects are minimal - if at all. I experienced some losoe stools, and nervousness. Other than that the medication is easy to take, and is only taken for five days.",Jocelyn
12,Azithromycin,Pneumonia,8.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"January 2, 2019",30,"People, azithromycin not only kills the bad bacteria, but also the good bacteria in your gut and intestinal tract, which immediately causes flaming diarrhea! You must get a potent probiotic to take along with the med. The one that works great for me has acidophilus in it. Relieves the problem almost immediately. I don’t know why the HECK doctors don’t mention this! ",Em

Never had it before.   Rate headache a 7 of 10.  Tylenol won’t touch it.  Lethargic.   Hard to sleep yet so tired.  General feeling that my body is being nuked.,Raymay
16,Azithromycin,Pneumonia,,Taken for less than 1 month,"February 25, 2018",8,"I took the first Zpack and quickly lost my fever and severity of cough..had rough sleep two days which seemed to directly correlate to a backslide in progress.  It is hard to say what a zero stress, good rest attempt would have done.  I got the tickle cough back day after finishing and a 99.5 fever 2 days after.  Now on my second round and again fever has gone, cough has mostly gone.  I only had gastro problems the first 24 hours and since it has been pretty tolerable but I take 80 billion probiotic each day at a different time of day and have taken a bit of saccharomyces boulardii to cut C-diff chances (although I have heard taking too much of this can cause adverse reactions sometimes)",chris

20,Azithromycin,Pneumonia,1.0,,"August 28, 2017",15,"I started off with very mild pneumonia with few coughs so the Dr gave me a 5 day Z-pack. After starting on this, my pneumonia didn't get any better. In fact it got progressively worse, my fevers higher, and my hot chills more frequent. No appetite and lots of body aches and soreness all over. At the end of finishing the medication, it was difficult to breathe without coughing almost every minute. Maybe this might work for other people, but it definitely didn't settle well with my body.",Anonymous
21,Azithromycin,Pneumonia,8.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"May 1, 2017",28,"So, I had walking pneumonia for a little while and didn't know. No symptoms  Then I got chest pain, went to the ER they sent me to the asthma room, and the albuterol treatments (all 3) only made my chest feel tighter. So they put me on the  oxygen and I instantly felt better, they decided to try albuterol again, and I stopped breathing I was immediately intubated and ended up with a collapsed lung found out I had an asthma attack WHILE having pneumonia. I was in the ICU,  most of my meds were given intravenously so I wasn't aware much of what I was given until I was released, the zithromax is great I feel better already. But even eating I have burning diahrea. I'm fine with it. I'd rather survive than complain about poop.",Chassity
22,Azithromycin,Pneumonia,7.0,,"January 10, 2017",27,"Unfortunately, although Azithromycin is a very good antibiotic, it is prescribed mostly for viral infections in the acute care setting based on people's symptoms and not on x-rays of the chest. If you have bronchitis which is mostly viral, Azithromycin is not going to do you any good. The color of the phlegm does not correlate with bacterial infections and therefore should not be used as a criteria for prescribing antibiotics. Fever does not mean much initially but after a URI or brochitis for 7-10 days fever is more significant and a bacterial source should be assessed. Sinusitis is not a shoot from the hip diagnosis. There are four pairs of para nasal sinuses and the doctor or PA cannot look inside your head. Do an x-ray or CT. Beware.",Urgent care doctor

After about two weeks I had to go to the doctor where they told me I had pneumonia. Having it before I expected some antibiotics that you take for over a week . and was very skeptical when I got these, considering there wasn't even a week. Day one of taking it I had some diarrhea and a headache but when I woke up the next morning I didn't have those symptoms again. Also that morning my symptoms from pneumonia had improved dramatically. By day 4 the infection was almost all of the way gone besides an ocassional cough. Very glad I tried this drug, helped me a lot!",ElizaB21
24,Azithromycin,Pneumonia,8.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"October 16, 2016",35,"I had to write this review because everyone else's reviews freaked me out so much before taking this antibiotic. I have a very sensitive stomach and if there is a side effect to a medication, I usually get it. I took this with food and I had no problems at all. No nausea, no stomach pains, no diarrhea, no hives, nothing. Only reason I didn't give this antibiotic ten stars is because I was hoping to feel better at this point. I just took my last dose and i definitely feel better, but still have a ways to go. All in all, I would recommend this antibiotic and do not be so afraid of the other reviews. Take with food and you will be fine.",Jeeeneee

I was diagnosed by an urgent care Dr. for common cold upper respiratory infection so was prescribed the medication. On my third day I was still congested and it was difficult coughing up phlegm, called an on line medical Dr. and recommended taking MucinexDm or RobutussinDm and it helped.

27,Azithromycin,Pneumonia,9.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"January 16, 2016",54,Had a 3 week sinus infection and flu before developing atypical pneumonia. Was prescribed azithromycin 500mg 1st day and 250mg for the next 4 days. Also RX'd cough syrup that had codeine in it and an inhaler. It's last day of the antibiotics and I'm feeling a lot better. The heaviness in my chest is still there and my shortness of breath is still hanging around but I can finally breathe without coughing. My doctor wants to see me again in a few days if the shortness of breath doesn't get significantly better. I also have very minor asthma though so I'm thinking that's just what's gotten worse. Definitely recommend azithromycin for pneumonia!,YogiBearTheGSDsMom
