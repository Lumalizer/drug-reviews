0,Iohexol,Head Imaging,4,Taken for less than 1 month,"October 26, 2021",3,"Omnipaque 350 (iohexol):I  have Lymph Node Swelling of Neck so went in for a neck CT w/contrast using 100 cc of Omnipaque 350 intravenously. Felt immediate heat was fine. 48 hrs later, I woke up with lower back stiffness/pain. Then another 48 hrs, added to that the neck became stiff/painful. I thought it was all a bad mattress. Ibuprohen hardly helps with the stiffness/pain. Messaged the prescribing Dr. I haven't heard back yet. I'm hoping that this goes away! I will update as I get more info.",suze79
