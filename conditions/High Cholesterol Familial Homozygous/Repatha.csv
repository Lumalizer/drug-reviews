Currently taking 25mg Pravastatin.  First injection of Repatha.  Minimal discomfort from injection.  On third day following injection began to experience difficulty swallowing, increased mucus production, EXTREME 'night sweats', significant breathing issues during sleep (waking 3-4 times during night), significant chest pain (around right pectoral muscle).  Blood pressure elevated (150/100). Breathing issues worsened but only occurred during sleep.  Immediately discontinued Prevastatin.  Breathing issues abated and swallowing improved.  Night sweats stopped.  Chest pains continuing.",New paitent
1,Repatha,High Cholesterol Familial Homozygous,10.0,,"July 26, 2021",2,"I was considering stopping Repatha because the pain of the injections were horrible!  I dreaded the day I had to give the injection. If you warm the Injection up, the shot was not supposed to cause as much pain. Researching information on Repatha, I found one gem that no one had told me Repatha can be left out up to 30 days!  I left my injection out overnight and put it under my arm just before I took the shot.  Hallelujah",Mimi
2,Repatha,High Cholesterol Familial Homozygous,10.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"March 12, 2021",7,After reading all of the comments this medicine seems to either come straight from the fiery pits of an evil place or a sunbeam from heaven. I have tried every medication available and started Repatha 3 years ago. Levels are awesome and absolutely no side effects whatsoever!,Andy
3,Repatha,High Cholesterol Familial Homozygous,10.0,,"November 1, 2020",10,Repatha is the best medication ever. Cholesterol went from OVER 200 to under 170. Never under 200 in my lifetime. No side-effects.,Pete
4,Repatha,High Cholesterol Familial Homozygous,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"October 25, 2020",25,"With Repatha I had elevated BP even with maximum BP meds. Ended in ER with BP over 200 with uncontrollable nosebleed.  Extreme joint pain and swelling, leg and back pain and muscle weakness.  Flushing, fatigue, headache and blurred vision.  Gained weight (sometimes 5 lbs over night.)  Stopped taking and hope side effects go away.",MissSassy
5,Repatha,High Cholesterol Familial Homozygous,10.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"August 24, 2020",23,"Repatha has been life altering for me.  Terrible genetic predisposition to high LDL and had angioplasty at 44.  Total plaque machine.  Been on statins, ezetimibe etc forever.  Couldn't get my LDL below 130 (on Crestor and Zetia), which basically means I'd be Super high risk by 65 with clogged carotids, early onset Alzheimer's and strokes.Repatha has my LDL at <10.  I've been on for 3 years and will be on Repatha or Praluent for the rest of my life, which I figure to have a better chance to much better and longer.I get mild cold symptoms for a short time after dosage, but nothing else.Test results have been superb, though I have not gone for measurements to see if my atherosclerosis is improving...which at near zero LDL it should be.",BetterNow
6,Repatha,High Cholesterol Familial Homozygous,10.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"June 9, 2020",17,"With diet, Zetia, and Pravastatin my LDL is the lowest that it has ever been. It works great. I do have minor side effects but they are tolerable for these results. I have heart disease that started before I was medicated and so far, no heart attacks.",Cee
7,Repatha,High Cholesterol Familial Homozygous,10.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"April 27, 2020",17,Started repatha 2 years ago after CABG for 6 arteries. Have never experienced any side effects. My cholesterol  scores are great now.,Baruch
8,Repatha,High Cholesterol Familial Homozygous,8.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"February 15, 2020",19,"I was seriously surprised to see all of these horrific reviews for Repatha.  I've been on it for two years and have had zero side effects after the first two weeks when I kind of sort of maybe had mild cold symptoms.  I believe that was likely psychosomatic from reading the warnings that came with my first dose.  I haven't been sick once, that I can recall, in the last two years nor had any aches and pains.  Sadly, maxed out on statins along with Repatha and a vegan diet void of any dietary cholesterol, my total cholesterol is still over 200 and my HDL is only 38.  I have a wicked case of FH that refuses to be beaten into submission.  My total cholesterol was over 500 on a vegan diet with no meds to give you reference of how much meds have helped me.  Repatha lowers my cholesterol slightly more than statins alone, so I plan to keep taking it as long as my co-pay card keeps my expenses low.",TKS
9,Repatha,High Cholesterol Familial Homozygous,,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"January 13, 2020",43,"After taking Repataha for 17 months I quit because of severe flu like symptoms for days after each shot. I had another heart attack resulting in more stents, kept taking Repatha  my hip flexors were so painful I had to hobble around for months after stopping drug. I was told if I didn't take it I would die but no way can I tolerate Repatha or statins. I guess I am waiting for the next new drug.",milepost20
10,Repatha,High Cholesterol Familial Homozygous,,,"December 25, 2019",27,"I've tried repatha twice now and I'm not a big fan. Flu like systems, swollen lymph node runny nose, shin pain, I'm miserable won't take it again. I pray I feel better soon.",Comet
11,Repatha,High Cholesterol Familial Homozygous,,,"November 19, 2019",46,"Right now, and for over 2 months, my quality of life has finished. Fever, extreme nasopharyngeal, ... see 4 specialist from allergy, PUds, ENT and Gastroscope! CT scans, blood tests, extreme fatigue, chills, fever over 101, constant visits to IM. He is baffled. Repatha drug is pure poison, should be black boxed. My life is now awful. Flu like symptoms for 2 month , extreme cough, laryngitis, neck pain, diarrhea blow outs, Horrible. Do not use this. The symptoms started slowly.... after 3 months I was in a debilitating condition from repatha.",LJP
12,Repatha,High Cholesterol Familial Homozygous,2.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"October 20, 2019",49,"I am a long term T1 Diabetic, with a familial history of High Cholesterol. I had a triple bypass 5 years ago and was doing really well for about the last 4 years post op. With continual elevated cholesterol numbers, my Dr put me on Repatha.The first 2 injections were ok, with some minor side effects, such as dizziness and pretty bad back pain. I went to my massage therapist ,and chiropractor, and was treated for about 3 months with some relief.  I also had a back x ray taken, with no major changes or abnormalities. I must admit, I DID NOT connect Repatha with these symptoms. Now, as far as that is concerned, it certainly did LOWER my bad cholesterol from 289 to 47, but again, at what price???My major ""new"" side effects after taking Repatha for  4 months: Dizziness, Blurry Vision, Excruciating foot, leg, hip and back pain, shortness of breath and a rapid heartbeat, joint and strange bone pain and a runny nose.",zoo keeper

15,Repatha,High Cholesterol Familial Homozygous,7.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"June 3, 2019",39,"I have had high cholesterol all my life.  Same as mother and grandmother. Went on statins in my mid-30s. Started taking Repatha  about three years ago. One injection every two weeks. My numbers came down greatly. I get my blood taken every three months or so. Lately I have been having  muscle twitching and cramping, mainly in my legs. I also feel that I have a type of anxiety, mainly feeling that in my upper body. I am getting a little forgetful as well. I am 58 years old and I exercise regularly.   I also take a baby aspirin and 5 mg of lisinopril for blood pressure. I would like to hear from anyone out there that has similar side effects and any remedies?",DNF
16,Repatha,High Cholesterol Familial Homozygous,,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"January 23, 2019",15,I am a 68 year old male with high LDL's. I'm on my 6th dose.  I have gone from every two weeks to one dose per month. My first 3 doses brought blurry vision and lung issues. These symptoms have subsided to zero. My LDL's have dropped from the high 100's down to 44. I will continue on 1 dose per month and check my blood monthly. If I can get this drug to continually work for me to keep my blood numbers in order I will be happy. I have never had numbers in the green before.Big Moe,Big Moe

18,Repatha,High Cholesterol Familial Homozygous,8.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"November 26, 2018",17,I started taking Repatha in September 2018 due to high cholesterol numbers and have had no significant problems.  To give you an idea of how well this medicine has worked for me my total cholesterol when I started was 309 and just 2 months later it’s 101.   Couldn’t be happier with the results.,Gabby
19,Repatha,High Cholesterol Familial Homozygous,7.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"September 5, 2018",26,Started injecting Repatha 4 months ago. Got IBS and now appear to be gluten intolerant. Don’t know if It’s a coincidence or linked to the medication. Feels like flu symptoms without the runny nose most of the time. Ache so much after going to the gym.,Mikecefn
20,Repatha,High Cholesterol Familial Homozygous,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"March 10, 2018",24,"Tried repatha and suffered a number of side effects. There was a lot of pain and swelling at the injection site. Later that evening suffered pretty severe abdominal and back muscle pain, headache, exacerbation of asthma symptoms, and general malaise. Most of these  symptoms continued for 5-7 Days. The symptoms were very similar to those I suffered after taking several flu shots. Figured there might be some connection, and discovered they both contain polysorbate 80; an emulsifier. Will not be taking this drug again.",Mickey
