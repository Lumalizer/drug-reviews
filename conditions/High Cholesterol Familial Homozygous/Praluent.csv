1,Praluent,High Cholesterol Familial Homozygous,6,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"October 23, 2018",12,"The medication is being taken in addition to statins. I have never had issues with my Crestor or Zocor, but my numbers were not low enough. The medication with the statin has brought my total  cholesterol to 142 and L DL down considerably. I have noticed worsening vision, joint pain in my hips and knees and a strange hoarse voice. I cannot say that the Prauluent is the cause, but I am having these investigated.   The onset of symptoms seems to align with the new medication, but it also aligns with being 50 ish and maybe everyone feels like rubbish at this age.",SuzeeQ
2,Praluent,High Cholesterol Familial Homozygous,1,,"July 17, 2016",32,"After one injection I experienced swelling of hands and feet. My blood pressure elevated by more than 50 #. Praulent researchers said I had an autoimmune reaction and that it all would pass as the Praulent left my system. After 8 months I still have the High blood pressure. I am currently being checked for Vasculitis as the result of my autoimmune reaction.",Frmrberger
