0,Crestor,High Cholesterol Familial Homozygous,10,,"September 7, 2017",44,"I am 52 and have been taking statins for 25 years. From mevecor, zocor, to Lipitor, zetia and now Crestor. I am lucky to have had no side effects but will say the Crestor has worked best at 40mg daily it helps keep it down around 230. Had a 95% blockage at age 28 and 1 stent last year. I believe statins have protected my heart over the years! My brother can not take them and had a quadruple bypass at 49.  Also everyone should have a calcium scan, simple and life saving.",tlr2143
