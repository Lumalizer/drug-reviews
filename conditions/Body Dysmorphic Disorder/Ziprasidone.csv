0,Ziprasidone,Body Dysmorphic Disorder,1,Taken for less than 1 month,"December 21, 2020",0,"Ok so i was excited to start this because of the weight neutral outcome. BUT i was hoping it would help me sleep, i was on Zyprexa for sleep but was upset with the weight gain. So was switched to this..it did NOT help me sleep at all. I felt hyper after i took it also had a metal taste in my mouth and it made my stomach hurt. Started at 40mg. Lets just say im back on Zyprexa and happy being having to deal with the weight gain and sleeping then weight loss and not sleeping. Would not recommend if you have trouble sleeping.",Cdwilson
1,Ziprasidone,Body Dysmorphic Disorder,1,,"May 11, 2016",2,"I'm going to start this off by saying that I was a COMPLETELY different person before I started taking this medication.  I was prescribed this medication when I was 12 years old, suffering from anorexia, severe depression, and anxiety.  This medicine gave me horrible side effects-- trouble with speech, socializing, and I became so dependent on this medicine every night that it took me 3  months of no sleep or food, having to miss school and be locked inside all day, to finally ween off it.  I feel like this medicine definitely 'fried' my brain, before taking this medicine I had no issues with motivation, attention, socializing, and speech.  After about 4 years off this medication, I can say I'm finally starting to feel a bit bit better.",b1497

3,Ziprasidone,Body Dysmorphic Disorder,1,,"September 12, 2011",18,"Geodon (ziprasidone):I took this drug at night and immediately went to sleep. When it became time to wake up the next morning I felt like I was in another world. It literally felt like the world was upside down. I couldn't stand in the shower and ended up collapsing in bed with only a half wet bath robe. I couldn't move and could barely pull cover over top of my immobile body. I had severe pains in my body and especially my legs. I didn't even begin to feel coherent until 3pm. I never took another dose. However, the following night I had insomnia and didn't sleep a wink for two days. This is a strong medicine. ",Anonymous
