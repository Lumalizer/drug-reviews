0,Escitalopram,Body Dysmorphic Disorder,,,"January 20, 2018",6,"I was given Lexapro for my Body dysmorphic disorder  - BDD  -(the performance anxiety is killing my sex life! I even tried Viagra). Started on 5mg and so far just gave a mild headache, a bit tired and foggy but nothing I can’t handle. I’m looking forward to moving up to 10mg but am very worried about the sexual side affects as that may make my BDD even worse. I’ve heard to time the drug right to help with sexual performance such as after sex or early in the morning if you anticipate sex that evening because the drug is most potent a few hours after taking it or using it along side Viagara.Any comments??",Nick613
1,Escitalopram,Body Dysmorphic Disorder,10.0,,"March 9, 2017",12,"I have binge eating disorder. The first day I started these, I noticed a difference. I wasn't eating until I puked. It helped me so much. I had normal portions. I didn't feel the need to eat when I was a little upset. It helped from day 1 and continues to do so.",Anony1803
2,Escitalopram,Body Dysmorphic Disorder,6.0,,"November 5, 2015",4,"I was on this medication last year after I overcame an eating disorder and it worked perfectly fine. my doctor told me everything was okay and took me off it, worst mistake ever. Now I've been on it again for 8 weeks and still feel blah with headaches and weird dreams; pretty much not feeling like me. It worked for me the first time taking this medicine; I would advise not to come off it if it if working.",KP25
3,Escitalopram,Body Dysmorphic Disorder,9.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"January 23, 2015",9,"Have been on Mozarin(Escitalopram 15mg) for about 3 years with one few months interval trying to give it up. Greatly helps for depression and social anxiety, makes body dysmorphic disorder easier to handle and somehow accept but absolutely doesn't cure. After this period of time decided to go off the medication as didn't see it was strong enough anymore. It's much worse without it, planning to go back on it or maybe start something new. Only drawback horrible withdrawal symptoms passing after 2-3 weeks.",Kate222
