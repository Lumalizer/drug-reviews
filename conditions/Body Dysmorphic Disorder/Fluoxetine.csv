0,Fluoxetine,Body Dysmorphic Disorder,8,,"July 31, 2019",9,"I have severe Body Dysmorphic Disorder (BDD). I am 38 nearly. I have been taking Flouxetine for about 3 months. Just gone from 20mg to 30mg. I am calmer, see things better but going through the see saw affect, so one day looks better then the day after. I have used a mirror for the first time in 15 years (I don't look at myself head on, just slightly 1cm close I'm one side of my face) - my flaws are somewhat non existent at times and even normal. The meds have made a huge impact that I didn't expect but I've years of work ahead of me to get 23 years of negativity somewhat normalised. If you suffer from BDD I understand your views, frustration and confusion that comes with it. Try meds and counselling to even get 30% better.....Try ignore the negative head and don't dwell to much. Long road ahead but fluoxetine does help and us worth taking.",Jen
1,Fluoxetine,Body Dysmorphic Disorder,8,,"March 3, 2013",66,"Prozac (fluoxetine):I have had social anxiety, body dysmorphic disorder, anorexia, generalized anxiety disorder, depression, and obsessive compulsive disorder. You name it, I have had it. Since taking Prozac two months ago, my mood has improved, my thoughts are clearer, I am more motivated about life, like it actually means something. I have no more racing negative thoughts, I am positive, confident, and enjoying life again! Mild side effects include dry mouth, drowsiness, wanting to sleep more, and mild sexual dysfunction.",CatMeow
