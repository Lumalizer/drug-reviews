But my military healthcare has decided to switch me to the generic formula of it and I'm miserable. Pressure and feeling like I have to pee all the time again. I'm miserable and its not like a Urologist can get you in within a decent amount of time.  So here I sit, so tired I'm crying. Why did it stop working?",MrsPeesAlot
1,Myrbetriq,Neurogenic Detrusor Overactivity,5,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"June 17, 2021",2,I'm finding it interesting reading these reviews on Myrbetriq. I first visited a Urology center and thought I had a UTI...by the time I left the PA I had a script of 25 mg a day. For the first few months it worked great but now it's a hit or miss. I feel I have the symptoms more so now than I did before.  I'm wondering if I really have the spastic bladder that I was told I dd so I am going for another opinion. Thank God I don't seem to have the side effects that others are speaking of,sunneee
