0,Diphenhydramine,Cold Symptoms,7,,"June 16, 2019",3,"I used generic Diphenhydramine HCL 25 mg capsule to help with runny nose, sore/scratchy throat and sneezing because of common cold. I took only one capsule before sleep at night. It made me sleepy right away. BUT it’s made me nauseated, helped with runny nose and sneezing. I don’t like that while I was asleep I kept feeling jittery.",Samantha
